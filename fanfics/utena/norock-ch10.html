&quot;This place is creepy, and I don&#39;t want to be here.&quot; Wakaba stated 
bluntly as soon as they had all piled out of Touga&#39;s limo. Kozue had her 
arm in both of Anthy&#39;s hands, a green glow emanating from them. When her 
arm was released she tested it gingerly. Then a grin proclaimed her 
pleasure. The arm felt better than new! All of her bruises and cuts, the 
raw marks from the ropes and handcuffs that had been used on her, all 
were gone like a distant dream! She had a glint back to her blue eyes, 
and a smirk back on her lips. &quot;Thanks Himemiya! I feel like a woman 
again.&quot; The short haired woman smirked as Anthy gave her a small bow. 
&quot;Of course.&quot; Anthy then went to tend to Touga.

Alone, Kozue stepped away from the rest of the group to gaze up at the 
monolithic structure before them. Nemuro Hall...it sent a chill down 
everyone&#39;s collective spines. Kozue bared her teeth at it ferally and 
turned away. She wasn&#39;t going to let some decrepit old building get to 
her. No, she was far more concerned about the looming school campus, 
visible against the twilight. That place...she thought she would never 
have to look upon that place again.

Her brow twitched in annoyance and she rejoined the group, where Anthy 
was answering some asked question.

&quot;Yes, we have no need to enter the school grounds themselves, so you 
needn&#39;t worry about that.&quot;

&quot;But we are entering here, which is just on the fringe of Ohtori?&quot; 
Saionji&#39;s voice was tinged with accusation. He was cupping his ear 
still, even after Anthy had healed the damage. The memory was still too 
fresh and raw. Anthy sighed.

&quot;Yes...it is necessary. We must go here in order to find a means to stop 
the Thousand Swords.&quot; She too looked up into the night, to see the dull 
gray building that arched high overhead. It was crumbling into rubble in 
several places, the stair and once grand archways little more than 
broken mortar. Sad really...all things beautiful are fated to end as 
nothing more than a dusty memory. Nemuro Memorial Hall was no different 
of course.

Wakaba frowned as she looked up at it. &quot;I remember...I remember coming 
here a long time ago. I met a man here, who made me.... do things...&quot; 
She trailed off uncomfortably as she felt the weight of stares turned 
her way. She shrugged to herself and looked away from them all. &quot;I 
was...very angry...hurt...he made me feel better for a little while. 
Funny. I can recall everything before and after, but like...I can&#39;t 
really remember him.&quot; She looked troubled by this. Anthy looked over at 
Kozue who had her arms crossed and her lips pursed. Shiori was holding 
Juri&#39;s hand looking deep in thought. And Anthy knew that they too were 
having the same difficulty. She paused before answering the unspoken 
question.

&quot;Your memories...were confined. No, tampered with after Utena won the 
Final Duel. It was meant to leave you happier...to make you forget the 
bad things.&quot; Anthy held herself, feeling a sudden chill in the night 
air. Her simple blouse wasn&#39;t very much protection against the cold. But 
she welcomed the humanizing sensation.

&quot;Utena I believe, desired your freedom from Ohtori. Your past would have 
interfered, acted as shackles. You did not remember anything about the 
duels or of the castle in the sky for years until you saw Ten...yes?&quot;

There were nods from several heads, as the ex-duelists watched her in 
rapt attention.

&quot;But, in the case of the Black Rose Duels, that particular 
experiment...was not entirely under our influence.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean? You and Akio had no control over them?&quot; Juri&#39;s arched 
brow spoke louder than words her suspicions of that belief. Anthy had to 
smile. And to Touga&#39;s discomfort, that small smile looked just a tad 
smug.

&quot;There was nothing at Ohtori that I and my brother did not have control 
over.&quot;

&quot;Then what did you mean, &#39;not entirely under you influence&#39;.&quot;

Anthy sighed and looked away. &quot;We had control over Mikage and his 
interviews; we simply...did not influence them ourselves. After his 
final failure, we banished Mikage back to the realm he belonged to. But 
his duels were not based upon the duelists themselves, as ours were. 
They were based on a strong dark desire inborn in the human psyche, to 
keep the world around them from changing. To keep everything.... 
Eternal.&quot; Anthy shrugged.

&quot;You all fought as duelists to seek a revolution for things that you 
sought to change, but Mikage was merely a shadow...and as a shadow he 
and his duelists fought to cling to memories and wasted desires. It is 
from those memories he gained his own bit of power. As well as his 
origins...&quot;

Touga crossed his arms, to mirror her. His designer suit crinkled ever 
so lightly at the bends of his elbows, throwing shadows down his 
forearms. The moon above them was waxing coldly from its crescent shape, 
offering scant light to see. &quot;His origins?&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes seemed to gleam a curious green for a moment, like a cat. 
It reminded more than one person of her darker brother. &quot;Yes. Mikage is 
and was...dead.&quot;

That made them all shiver, as the gazed as one up at the lonely stone 
structure. Now they seemed to hear the whispers of ghosts....could 
imagine those shadows possibly being eyes...feel a pressure at the base 
of their shoulders. Wakaba looked to be on the verge of tears. &quot;S-so if 
that guy&#39;s d-dead...why are we going in there? Why&#39;d ya call this a 
&#39;place of greatness&#39; or whatever?&quot;

Anthy smiled gently at her. &quot;It is a &#39;place of power&#39;...and we are going 
here to ask Mikage some questions.&quot;

Touga&#39;s red mane sparkled in the dimmed headlights of the limo, which 
was still purring quietly behind him. &quot;So...we are going to commune with 
the dead?&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes darkened as her smile slipped away.

&quot;Exactly.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Footsteps clacked and echoed off the walls, making curtains of 
dust-covered cobwebs wave silently back and forth. Their ghostly 
movements were like fronds under the ocean, a rhythmic back-and-forth 
motion that drew the eye. All around the group of men and women there 
were cracked bricks showing up through the wood paneling. Overhead 
amidst the shadowed alcoves there were places where pieces of the 
ceiling were gone, allowing pale moonlight to shine down from the sky 
above. But over all, there was darkness.


Kozue was bringing up the rear, with Touga in the middle and Anthy 
taking point. The reasoning had been that both Kozue and Touga had 
lighters from their smoking habits. And Anthy apparently kept 
flashlights in her pocket. No one had asked. So with their scant light, 
the seven headed down the long dark corridor to where an elevator 
waited. The doors had been melted in what looked like an old fire. Juri 
frowned as she walked up to one side of the elevator. Her fingertips 
brushed what she had originally thought was empty space. Only to find 
those &#39;shadows&#39; come away on her fingers. She brought her two fingers 
back up for closer inspection.

&quot;Ash. The button for the elevator is coated in ash and debris. Does this 
elevator even work any more?&quot; She turned to Anthy to ask. Anthy shook 
her head in negative. Shiori stepped closer to her lover, taking her 
hand in her own for comfort. This place really was creepy...

&quot;Hmmm...we&#39;ll need to find another way down.&quot; Saionji mused, stroking 
his bearded chin. His short green ponytail swished against his collar as 
he moved to one side of the hall. He ran hands along the wall.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Wakaba asked with a touch of impatience. It was 
the first time she had addressed him directly. Not even when she had 
held him in her arms during the limo ride. It would seem that the 
temporary truce that grief and fear had brought on, was now gone. Kozue 
arched a brow in interest at the tension between them. My, how 
entertaining...what could have happened between those two? The last time 
she had seen Kyouichi and Shinohara, they had been planning the day they 
would sign the Japanese registry together. And uncharacteristically, 
Kyouichi certainly looked uncomfortable. Kozue Kaoru, in her borrowed 
suit jacket and leather miniskirt, wasn&#39;t the only one to notice the 
couple&#39;s awkwardness.

Saionji frowned as he turned to glance at his fianc&eacute;e, &quot;I&#39;m looking for 
a door. Surely there&#39;d have to be stairs somewhere. We can take those 
instead of the elevator.&quot;

Touga&#39;s voice was a gentle reminder, &quot;Yes...but those stair most likely 
wouldn&#39;t be very safe. The fire would have either weakened their 
foundations or destroyed them completely.&quot;

Wakaba snorted quietly as she folded her arms and added, &quot;Idiot.&quot;

Saionji huffed and took a step toward her, &quot;And what are we supposed to 
do then? If the elevator is out and we can&#39;t use the stairs, what other 
options have we?!&quot; His temper flared.

Wakaba marched right up to him, getting into his face as she growled 
angrily, &quot;Don&#39;t you yell at me, buster! This wasn&#39;t my stupid idea. I 
don&#39;t even want to be here, this place brings back too many horrible 
memories!&quot;

Touga and Juri tried to intervene, pushing them back away from each 
other by the shoulders as Saionji&#39;s fists clenched. The two glared at 
each other hotly, their voices rising.

&quot;Just because you&#39;re chickening out over ghost stories, doesn&#39;t mean you 
can just say whatever you want! We&#39;re trying to find a way to beat those 
damn swords!&quot;

&quot;In a stupid old building?! How retarded is that?!&quot;

&quot;Memories are just memories, why do you have to let them interfere with 
the present?!&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s because of you that I have those memories!&quot;

Saionji threw his hands in the air in exasperation, as the group watched 
in fascination. &quot;You said that last night, I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re 
talking about!&quot;

Wakaba&#39;s eyes suddenly began to stream in angry tears as her dainty 
fists clenched. &quot;It&#39;s because of YOU!!&quot; She choked on a sob as she 
looked down at her right hand. Her fingers uncurled from the 
white-knuckled fist, to remain limp at her side. When she looked back 
up, her brown bangs were mused and getting in her eyes, her face 
contorted with pain. &quot;I-it&#39;s.....it&#39;s all because of you, Sai-chan...&quot; 
Her voice broke sadly. Saionji hesitated before reaching out a hand to 
her, but she jerked away from him and moved to stand alone in the 
shadows by the elevator. Her shoulders shook, the only indication that 
she was holding back a sob. After a moment, her low voice drifted over 
to the group, who looked as though they wished they could give the two 
some privacy.

&quot;This...this place...that day you rejected me, after I had hidden you in 
my room for so long...when you gave that hair clip to Anthy...I...I came 
here.&quot; A sniff, as Wakaba kept her back turned. Saionji was clenching 
his fists again, looking mournful. Desperately wanting to go to her.

&quot;I was so angry...I was so hurt...after all I had done...I thought...I 
thought that maybe you would have...you could have...but no...you chose 
her again, just as you always did!&quot; She whirled and stabbed a finger at 
Anthy, who&#39;s expression was carefully guarded.

&quot;You were always the one, pulling the strings...hurting people...hurting 
Utena! You took everything from me, even my memories!! I wish I had 
never got them back...I wish I didn&#39;t have to remember the look on 
Utena&#39;s face when I stood waiting for her on that crazy platform...with 
that sword in my hand. I didn&#39;t even know how to use a sword then, but I 
fought her and hurt her...just to get at you!&quot;

Her voice cracked as the tears flowed freely down her face, Anthy didn&#39;t 
move as Wakaba invaded her personal space, didn&#39;t move as Wakaba raised 
a fist to swing at her. But the fist never landed. Instead her head hung 
down in defeat. &quot;You all...you all were toyed with by her...we never 
knew, but we were...she did things...said things...and now...now we&#39;re 
back here. Back in this place...I hate it.&quot;

Shiori stepped forward and wrapped arms around the slightly taller 
woman, taking her in her arms as she whispered fiercely. &quot;I 
know...we...we all know...&quot; Kozue came over and rested a hand on Wakaba&#39; 
shoulder as the brown haired girl tried to compose herself.

&quot;That man...he orchestrated a lot of things. That much is clear now. But 
it was in the past, and the past can&#39;t hurt us anymore.&quot; Her blue eyes 
were dark in the dim light. Then she suddenly hissed and stuck her thumb 
in her mouth, having singed it on her lighter. She flicked it again, and 
after several sparks it came back to life. Their light source was 
running out, they needed to hurry this up. Kozue looked over at Touga 
and nodded her head towards the elevator in silent communication. He 
gave a nod and detached from the group to resume his investigation of 
it.

Saionji&#39;s low voice came out as a rumble in the darkness. 
&quot;Wakaba...I...never did give that clip to Anthy.&quot; She sniffed and looked 
over at him. He was scuffing his shoe into the charred floor.

&quot;That time when I was staying with you...when you helped me...I was 
honestly so happy. Those were some of my most precious memories.&quot; He 
looked up at her, his violet eyes beseeching. &quot;I know I hurt you. It was 
inexcusable...but please believe me, I was making that clip for you...&quot;

Wakaba&#39;s tears slowly halted as she regarded him with hesitant belief.

&quot;When I had finished making the clip...that...that man...Odd, I don&#39;t 
remember what he looks like anymore...but, he said that he would get me 
back reinstated to the school, as long as I gave him that clip. At the 
time, all I could think about was getting out of my expulsion, so I 
didn&#39;t really care why he wanted it. I was...very selfish when I was 
younger. The duels...the school....kendo...those were the only things 
that made up my world. Until I met you.&quot;

He broke off, a slight flush to his pale cheeks. He looked up to find 
Wakaba standing before him, holding out her hand. He took it, wrapping 
his larger one around it.

&quot;I love you, Seaweed Head...&quot; Juri&#39;s eyes bulged, and she had to hide an 
unseemly snort at that particular pet name. But the next one was bad 
enough to make her start &#39;coughing&#39; into her hand.

&quot;I love you too, Onion Head.&quot;

Shiori giggled at that, and Anthy smiled. Kozue rolled her eyes as the 
two kissed, seeming to forget they had an audience. &quot;Alright, enough 
already. The sugary display is giving me cavities. We need to find a way 
down to the lower levels, so...if you don&#39;t mind?&quot;

The two blushed, and halted in their affections. But even as the group 
reassembled more firmly around the elevator shaft, Wakaba and Saionji&#39;s 
hands remained linked. Touga was engrossed in his study of the elevator 
cables.

&quot;The doors are pried open, and we can access the cables, but it looks 
like the elevator is down at the bottom. We need some way to get it up 
here and out of the way, if we slide down the cables.&quot;

Juri frowned and looked in as well. &quot;Hmmm...that doesn&#39;t sound very 
safe...and who knows how many floors are down here? Isn&#39;t there some way 
to get the elevator working?&quot;

Touga frowned as he thought. &quot;Not without a descent power supply. And 
that&#39;s not even knowing if the cable is still attached down at the 
bottom, or even if it will hold. We&#39;d be taking a gamble.&quot;

Juri smirked. &quot;I think we&#39;ve been gambling long before this.&quot; Touga 
smiled back and nodded. Then he looked over questioningly at Anthy.

&quot;You have your...abilities....isn&#39;t there something you can do about 
this? Can you make the elevator move?&quot;

Anthy closed her eyes a moment and concentrated. Then she opened them 
with a nod. &quot;Yes...but I may need to borrow power from some of you to 
get us down and back up. My powers...are not what they once were.&quot; She 
frowned, remembering a time when such a thing would have been easy. No 
longer. There were many problems associated with being mortal. She bit 
her lip, and then shook her head to clear it.

&quot;The elevator is old, and it&#39;s stained with Mikage&#39;s power. Not to 
mention the weight of so many passengers.&quot; Her hands moved gracefully in 
the air as she spoke, punctuating her point.

Saionji looked a question at her, &quot;Should some of us stay behind then?&quot;

She shook her head, making her lavender tresses bounce slightly. &quot;No. I 
think it best we all stay together, especially down there. The dead can 
be...irksome.&quot;

That made him grimace. The idea of having to deal with dead people, 
didn&#39;t exactly appeal. Would they be rotting shambling things, like 
something out of one of Wakaba&#39;s horror movies? Spectral ghosts with big 
teeth perhaps? He gripped the hilt of his sword. Touga chuckled, seeing 
his reaction.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Princess.... I&#39;ll protect you.&quot;

Saionji glared at him and huffed. &quot;I am not afraid. Here, Anthy-chan...&quot; 
he walked over and pushed up his jacket sleeve to reveal the pale skin 
of his wrist and forearm. &quot;Take whatever you needed.&quot;

Anthy bowed in thanks, and placed her hand firmly around his arm. She 
handed her flashlight to Shiori, who took it to illuminate their 
surroundings. Wakaba came over as well, retaking his hand as Anthy 
closed her eyes. The duelists looked on, as there came a shiver in the 
air. Then, a deep humming, a painful vibration in their very bones. 
Anthy&#39;s hand glowed red hot, and threads of tiny burning energy seeped 
up from the green man&#39;s flesh.

He winced, gritting his teeth, but didn&#39;t move. Anthy began chanting 
under her breath, in a dialect he couldn&#39;t understand. Perhaps no human 
could really understand it. Then came a rumbling from below. Dust rained 
down on the party from the ceiling as a metallic scraping and creaking 
announced the elevator&#39;s slow climb upward.

After several minutes, (and several lighter flickings) later, the 
elevator rolled painfully into view. Looking like little more that a 
twisted platform. It only had one wall remaining. Touga and Juri looked 
at it dubiously, before stepping onto it. Gingerly they shifted their 
weight on, but the contraption seemed solid. &quot;Come on everyone, quickly 
now.&quot; Touga ushered the rest of them on, with Anthy still holding 
Saionji&#39;s arm. The man was beginning to look a bit pale.

Anthy released him, and then grit her teeth in concentration as the 
elevator began shaking violently. The elevator calmed down, but she held 
out her hand.

&quot;I-I...need a new donor...hurry please...&quot; Juri put her hand out before 
Touga could, winking at him. &quot;You&#39;ll get your turn on the way back, 
Kiryuu.&quot; She bit off her words hurriedly as she felt a painful sensation 
burning on the palm of her hand. Anthy was holding it, tightly, drawing 
her strength and pouring it into moving the elevator. The steel groaned 
loudly with the effort, but eventually did begin going down. Juri winced 
as she began to feel light headed. It felt worse than giving blood.

Everyone kept carefully away from the sides of the shaft, naked as they 
were, and rushing past quickly. As the elevator moved down, rumbling 
down the deep tunnel towards its destination, Shiori looked up at the 
piece of wall that did remain. There was something hanging on it.

Reaching her hands up, she took down a framed shadowbox. The glass pane 
had a sharp crack along its surface. Inside, once she carefully scraped 
away the ash and dust, was a pinned butterfly. It&#39;s wings unfurled and 
frozen in death. It was...familiar...

The elevator jarred to a halt, and Juri was released, panting softly. 
Shiori dropped the frame and took the older woman in the circle of her 
arms, as she sagged back. Juri stayed that way a moment, as she 
collected her breath.

Touga was the first to step out of the elevator...

...and into brackish water.

He cursed loudly as he shook off his pant&#39;s leg. He was soaked to the 
knee. The foundations had indeed been weak, and it would seem that the 
water lines had broken. Just over there he made out what looked to be 
pieces of bent pipe rising up out of the water. Dangerous...they would 
need to be very very careful. Turning his head back to sigh to the 
others, the red haired Touga said, &quot;Well friends, it looks as though the 
next leg of this journey will be a wet one. I do hope some of you 
brought rubber boots.&quot;

A few half-hearted chuckles as they all gingerly plunged into the 
midnight waters. Carefully shuffling their feet forward, feeling about 
for debris and underwater dangers, Anthy led them on into the darkness. 
Touga&#39;s lighter sputtered out eventually, and Kozue&#39;s wasn&#39;t long to 
follow. They now had to rely on Anthy&#39;s flashlight. The pale yellow beam 
cut across the water, moving back and forth in a lazy arc as Shiori 
tried to light up what was in front of them. Anthy suddenly stopped, 
causing Wakaba to nearly topple her over.

&quot;W-what is it?&quot; She asked fearfully, clinging to Saionji like a 
lifeline.

Anthy held up a hand and pointed before them. &quot;We...have arrived.&quot;

They were standing before a cracked glass tank sitting low in the water.

And rising above the glass tank, swirling translucent and spectral was 
what looked to be some kind of steam. But when it stopped swirling about 
in place, and a piece of itself rose as if to look at them, the group 
knew without a doubt that this was no steam. Steam didn&#39;t glow.

Anthy stood before it and raised a hand out to it in welcome. The thing 
inched closer, and slowly entwined down her wrist and arm, making a lazy 
arc about the outstretched limb. Like a cat coming to see it&#39;s mistress, 
or dog welcoming its master home. Anthy&#39;s eyes began to glow a bright 
green, that illuminated her face in the darkness. Juri hissed and took a 
step back, pushing Shiori behind her. But Anthy didn&#39;t seem to realize 
the group&#39;s unease. Her hair began to waft gently in an unseen breeze as 
her eyes pulsated in time with the words she murmured under her breath. 
The spectral mist writhed as her hand suddenly closed around it in a 
tight fist. It never made a sound, but its painful twisting in her hand 
made Touga think sickly of a worm being squeezed to death in a child&#39;s 
hand. The sight made him ill. This...was a side of Anthy they had never 
seen before. And it was a side he didn&#39;t feel comfortable witnessing.

Anthy&#39;s spine bowed, and her lips parted in an odd growling noise, then 
she flung the spirit away from her, ordering harshly:

&quot;Bring him to me! Bring forth Mikage, once called Nemuro! I name your 
master twice, tell him the Witch of Roses seeks an audience!!&quot;

The thing gave a small squeal and sped off into the blackness. The group 
waited, feeling fear and agitation knot their muscles. Swords rasped as 
they were drawn from their sheaths, and a semi-circle was formed around 
Anthy. Everyone faced in the direction she gazed, trying in vain to 
pierce the gloom. Anthy waited, her spine very straight, and her hair 
still waving in the air like wheat fields in the summer time.

They waited...

And still no one came...

There was some impatient shuffling in the water, ripples ringing out 
from the collection of bodies. Wakaba was trying hard not to imagine how 
much bacteria and disease was probably just swimming about her kneecaps. 
Kozue was thinking longingly of a club she liked to frequent, and a 
certain bar tab she had no intention of paying.

Then...the air shifted...

Coalescing before their very eyes, from bits of light and swirling 
energy, a man-shape image came into being. He was younger than they, but 
at the same time seemed older. He wore a pair of glasses, his longish 
pink hair appearing as nothing more than a gleaming silver. His body 
seemed nearly perfectly solid at the torso and head, but oddly faded to 
translucence as it came down to his legs. He wasn&#39;t looking at Anthy. 
No, his cold eyes were set firmly on where Wakaba was clinging to her 
lover. And then they clinically moved to look at Kozue and Shiori in 
turn. Having assessed their presence, those dead eyes moved to look at 
each of the ex Student Council members in turn. And only then did Nemuro 
look at Anthy.

For Nemuro he truly was.

But not once did he speak. Just silently regard them all.

...Waiting...

Anthy slowly went back to normal, the summoning complete. Her eyes 
ceased their inhuman glow, and her hair settled. But when she turned 
around to look at the group, they still flinched as one. She sighed, 
&quot;Forgive me...&quot; But didn&#39;t elaborate. Gesturing behind her, like a 
professor lecturing his students, the dark skinned woman spoke. &quot;The 
dead are unable to speak to us, without...assistance. Do any of you 
recall readings of Homer and his works?&quot;

Touga gave a nod, as did Shiori and Juri. Kozue shrugged like it wasn&#39;t 
important. They were all oddly becoming a little more relaxed, now that 
the spook show with Anthy was over. Knowing she had had powers for the 
duels...had pulled swords out from between her breasts...had manipulated 
each of them into fighting for her brother&#39;s sake... Well that was one 
thing. But actually seeing the hooky Voo-Doo crap? Quite another. 
Still...it certainly had been interesting. And if she could do all that, 
Kozue wondered what she had had in store for them next. Even the dead 
guy hovering over the aquarium tank wasn&#39;t so scary anymore...but god 
she needed a cigarette.

Anthy smiled and elaborated in those sweet dulcet tones of hers. 
&quot;Well...one of the things Homer was correct about was the need for 
blood. The dead cannot speak without it&#39;s properties...so I shall need 
to make a small cut on my wrist. Do any of you have a knife?&quot;

Saionji blinked. &quot;Won&#39;t a sword do just as well?&quot;

Anthy smiled pleasantly as she answered, &quot;I would rather not cut all the 
way to the bone, if it is alright with you.&quot; Saionji blinked in surprise 
as Touga gave an outright laugh. Juri joined in with a smirk, and just 
like that the tension melted completely. Blood...they needed blood.

Wakaba felt about in her pockets but could only produce a pair of nail 
clippers. Shiori had a seat of keys, and Kozue just had a pack of 
cigarettes and an empty lighter. Anthy sighed and shrugged. &quot;Oh 
well...please hold your sword very still, Touga.&quot;

He nodded, and held it carefully by the thicker part of the blade, as 
Anthy leaned in close. And although Shiori winced in sympathy, Anthy 
didn&#39;t flinch as a small bead of blood rose on her skin. Squeezing her 
fingers on her forearm, she worked more blood to the surface. Nemuro 
watched her with a raptor&#39;s gaze. She moved back towards him, and he 
floated down to her. Cradling her offering in his hands, so she would 
not move away, Nemuro pressed his lips to the wound. And began to drink 
deeply. It was a small wound, barely more than a nick. And he didn&#39;t 
remain there long. But there was something in the witch&#39;s blood that 
gave him power...that solidified him further. That sparked intelligence 
and a sort of life into his eyes.

Nemuro rose from where he had been hunched over, and floated before them 
all once more. He wore a purple coat and a pair of crisp white pants, 
looking just as he did the day he had burned down the Hall. His voice, 
when he spoke, echoed and made hidden things in the shadows flutter. 
Touga kept his sword out and ready.

&quot;Why are you here now?&quot;

Anthy raised her chin in confidence and replied, &quot;We&#39;ve come to ask you 
for help in destroying the Thousands Swords. They have been released.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

Those two words held the weight of knowledge and eternity in them. Anthy 
remained resolved. &quot;Will you tell us how to destroy them, Nemuro?&quot;

&quot;No. They cannot be destroyed.&quot;

That made the group fidget. Anthy&#39;s eyes narrowed, &quot;They cannot be 
destroyed? Surely they must be able to. They are a threat to mankind, 
that cannot be allowed to remain free!&quot;

Nemuro gave a sigh, the sound of dry leaves rustling along marble 
corridors. &quot;They cannot be destroyed. They must be laid to rest.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;By combating their very nature. By reaching the source.&quot;

Anthy looked annoyed. &quot;Explain. You are being vague.&quot;

&quot;By completing the story. By the symbolic representation of their 
elements and their element&#39;s polar opposites.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re speaking in riddles, Nemuro! I don&#39;t understand!&quot; Juri couldn&#39;t 
help but feel a small bit of smugness at seeing Anthy on the receiving 
end of weird messages and dialog. Then she admonished herself for 
thinking such a thing at a time like this. Nemuro looked annoyed. The 
living these days were so bloody dense. Must he honestly spell it out?

&quot;There are ten main sword leading their stupider and lesser 
brethren...each bearing a different sort of Hatred...they are entwined 
with one another but are also separate entities.&quot; He crossed his ghostly 
arms, and arched an eyebrow. It should have looked comical, but somehow 
it wasn&#39;t. &quot;Use your brain, I know you must have some semblance of 
intelligence. To lay them to rest, you must first weaken them by using 
something symbolic of what&#39;s opposite of their natures. Of what they are 
put on earth to represent.&quot;

Juri cut in, &quot;But ten different types of hatred? Isn&#39;t that a bit much? 
How are we supposed to figure out what they are?&quot; She glared back 
defiantly as the ghost scowled darkly. He hated being interrupt, living 
or dead.

&quot;Fool...that is for you to figure out. I&#39;m not here to hold your hand, 
merely show you the way.&quot; Juri bristled at that, and her maroon haired 
wife moved in to rub her hands on her arms.

Nemuro waved a hand in the air, leaving an after image trailing behind. 
&quot; When they were released, we felt their rage here within our domain. 
They have breached the world of the living and the dead, and have since 
their birth. They are not a natural creation. They upset the balance. 
You must put them to their final rest, so that order is once again 
established. The wheel wobbles on its axis, as things are now...&quot;

Anthy thought for a moment before speaking. &quot;Will you...lend us some 
sort of power with which to battle the swords?&quot; Her eyes pleaded with 
him, begging him to listen. &quot;They will not go easy to their graves...and 
I don&#39;t have the sort of power I once had before...before my...&quot;

&quot;Mortality.&quot;

&quot;...Yes. I had to use some of your own power just to call you. I&#39;ve 
become...weak...&quot; She spat that last word out distastefully.

Nemuro regarded her quietly, and then he slowly floated towards her. She 
looked up in confusion but didn&#39;t move as he placed a ghostly hand on 
her cheek. It tingled coldly...buzzing faintly with some sort of 
electricity. He leaned in closer, as if to kiss her.

&quot;Even now...even now in this state...I can still see you as him...as my 
precious Mamiya...&quot; His lips brushed the top of her forehead as he 
floated back silently. &quot;You fed me falsehood and lies. it is because of 
you and your brother that I am still trapped here...&quot;

Anthy shook her head. &quot;No...my brother no longer has a hold on you. It 
was your own bid for power...your desire for your science that has 
condemned you to rot in this hole. But you needn&#39;t remain.&quot; She looked 
away a moment, before taking a breath, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. For deceiving you 
back then, Nemuro. I really did like you, despite my brother&#39;s 
ambitions. You don&#39;t deserve to be here.&quot;

He gave her a small smile, the first he&#39;d given at all. But in the grips 
of death, it had no warmth. &quot;Thank you... If you will help us to be free 
of this place, we will give you our power to add to your own.&quot;

He continued to gaze down at them, but suddenly sparks of light began to 
flicker into being all around them. Like stars in the darkness, more of 
the ghostly spectral fogs began to swirl and dip about the group of 
duelists. Mikage&#39;s voice raised as he swept a hand at the ghost lights.

&quot;These are the spirits of the dead, still trapped within these walls! 
These are the ghosts of 100 duelists, who died in a fire of my own 
creation. Young men and women, who died before they ever realized their 
dreams!&quot;

The ghost began moving as one, swirling in a lazy circle about the ring 
of living bodies, who grouped together more tightly. As Mikage spoke on, 
the circling spirits began to move faster and faster. Coming together 
like the wall of a tornado, with Anthy and the others at its eye.

&quot;We, the forgotten duelists, will lend you our strength. That you might 
fight as we never were able to. Use our power to bring forth a new 
revolution!&quot;

The twister tightened before breaking out into raging streams of 
ectoplasmic light. A stream roared and slammed into Touga&#39;s chest, 
making him bend back in a silent scream.

Another hit Juri and then Saionji, catching them wide-eyed and fearful. 
They glowed white-hot for a moment, their naked swords pulsating with 
the unnatural light. Anthy followed them not long after, her eye sockets 
pouring green light like blazing meteors. The four of them shivered and 
dropped to their hands and knees in the stagnant water. But Kozue, 
Shiori, and Wakaba remained untouched. Nemuro floated down to them.

&quot;You three...you three were of my chosen champions. My lovely Black Rose 
duelists. For you three, I offer a choice.&quot;

The three women huddled together; Kozue taking them both into her arms 
and glaring out at the ghost with hostility. She had not forgotten what 
she had done to her brother because him. The bastard had caused them a 
lot of grief!

&quot;You would not have been brought into these series of events, had it not 
been for your association with the Council and the Champion. You were 
characters in a gallery, positioned and puppeted about for the pleasure 
of higher powers. Much as I was...and I was no different to you... So I 
will offer you a choice. I can lend you protection. Protection from the 
swords, that you need not fear their touch upon you. That you may go in 
peace to your homes, to safety.&quot;

Shiori bit her lip, but then raised her chin in a frown. Eyes flashing 
in a flare of courage and love, she answered him coolly. &quot;I will not 
stand by while my love goes to fight those damnable things. I will not 
be left at home to wait for her!&quot;

Her statement was echoed in the eyes of her Black sisters. Nemuro smiled 
again softly with pride. He nodded. &quot;...then I offer you a means to 
fight as well. You were not true duelists back then...you only borrowed 
your strength. I will now grant you true strength of your own. With the 
knowledge and experience of one hundred individuals fueling it. But I 
will also grant you power...from myself.&quot; He leaned in and touched each 
of their cheeks in turn. As his pale fingers would moved away, for an 
instant a tiny glowing sigil of a rose would remain. Fading quickly to 
nothingness. He nodded to himself, his form becoming less solid. He was 
beginning to disappear.

&quot;There...you three...have received my power...and now my time here is 
done... Witch...help to free my fellows to oblivion...I can offer you 
nothing more...&quot;

His legs began to disappear, and his shoulders began to sag. Anthy, now 
brimming with necromantic power, raised her hands in the air and began 
to move them in a series of fluid motions. A light from the dark ceiling 
above, broke through the gloom like a golden sun. As it lit up the room, 
Touga could now see that several scorched coffins were floating half 
submerged in the black waters of the basement. It was from these coffins 
that the ethereal images of smiling boys and girls, garbed in an old 
style of Ohtori&#39;s school uniform, began to rise. They flew up in a 
multitude, heading up into the light. And moving on to whatever lay 
beyond. At last, only Nemuro remained behind, his form barely an outline 
in the air.

His voice was distant, and barely understandable as he painfully rose up 
into the air. He seemed weighted and tired. He looked at Anthy, who 
still continued to chant and make the ritualistic motions necessary for 
the gate. He gave her a sad smile.

&quot;I-I...have sinned...but now I am free....good luck, 
Princess...y-your....&quot;

He shivered as he felt the pull of the light. His body began moving 
towards it of its own accord. But as he moved, he twisted his head back 
to look at them, calling out from far away.

&quot;...Y-your brother....awaits you....in the Tower! The first.....his 
s-sword...is the sword-&quot;

There was a boy waiting for him in the light. A brown haired boy with a 
warm smile and open arms. Nemuro smiled joyfully and moved to meet him. 
As they embraced and disappeared into the light, his last words 
whispered themselves in the duelist&#39;s minds:

...of Self Loathing...

Anthy lowered her arms and the light winked out of existence. The gate 
was shut once more. Taking a shaky breath, she turned to face the group. 
They watched her with new eyes.

&quot;Lets get out of here.&quot;

Getting back out of the ruins of Nemuro Memorial Hall proved to be far 
easier now that Anthy had additional reserves of power to draw on. The 
return trip was one spent in silence however, each reflecting on what 
they had seen and witnessed. It was something none of them would ever 
forget for the rest their lives.

Coming back to the limo, Touga was of course the first to speak. &quot;I can 
feel it. I can feel a new strength from those old duelists. It&#39;s 
like...having a battery put in my back.&quot; He remarked thoughtfully. He 
flexed his arm, looking down at it with a calm wonderment. Anthy gave 
him a tired smile. The ordeal had drained her in many ways. 
&quot;Good...because we will most assuredly need it when we face the swords.&quot;

Kozue arched an eyebrow as she placed a hand on her hip. She was 
currently leaning on the hood of Touga&#39;s limo, resting. &quot;He said that 
the Chairman was the first sword. Self Loathing was it? Guess that means 
we&#39;ll be paying our alma mater a visit after all.&quot; She smirked, &quot;And 
damn...I didn&#39;t bring my nicer shoes.&quot;

Anthy looked over her friends quizzically. They all seemed...more at 
ease than she would have thought they would be. In fact, they looked to 
be in good spirits? Juri was teasing Saionji playfully by the car door, 
Wakaba was smiling cheerfully. Weren&#39;t they frightened of what was to 
come? Of facing her brother again after so long? Touga seemed to 
interpret her thoughts, for he came over and placed a comforting arm 
around her shoulders.

&quot;They trust one another. And they trust you. And they&#39;re fighting to 
save Utena. That&#39;s how they can be so relaxed. Because they&#39;ve finally 
found something to unite them all again.&quot;

Anthy shook her head in amazement, &quot; Even after what they&#39;ve seen? After 
the terrible things they&#39;ve witnessed? They&#39;re stronger than I could 
ever think possible.&quot;

Touga gave her a small hug before releasing her to head for the limo.

&quot;Friendship is powerful thing.&quot;

Up in his tower conservatory, hunched underneath what used to be his 
projector, Akio Ohtori rocked back and forth. His hair was disheveled, 
his clothes stained and dirty. It looked like he hadn&#39;t bathed in weeks. 
Which was the truth. His eyes gleamed silver, as he lifted his head. 
They were coming...the Rose Knights...the Witch...they were coming 
here...

He sent out his message to the other swords to alert them, before 
sighing sadly to himself. They had to die...he had to die...everything 
had to die, because it was too disgusting to go on. He was a failure, 
washed-up. The One needed to be placated though...and that was enough 
for him to stumble to his feet. Dragging his sword by the tip, he headed 
for the worn couch that looked as though it had stood the test of time. 
Plopping down heavily onto it, he sighed again and waited. The very air 
seemed heavy and thick as molasses. The intensity of his own self 
loathing.

He would wait for them. And then he would slice them apart. And then 
when it was over with, and the One had their heads, he would get back to 
slicing himself.

Akio looked down at the red dress shirt he was wearing. the sleeves had 
been torn off. There were a mass of scars running up and down his arms, 
along parts of his chest, and even along his throat. He gazed at his 
dark skin, so much like his sister&#39;s. So ugly. So disgusting. He 
couldn&#39;t stand to even be in his own skin anymore. He hated this. He 
hated this existence...this mortality forced upon him...

The once proud god of the campus, the All-Powerful Chairman...was now 
little more than a middle aged man. His hair now had signs of gray. 
There were wrinkles and bags under his eyes. And his skin had dulled and 
grayed with malnutrition. But the Sword kept him alive... he had to stay 
alive so he could cut away the ugliness...

He was going to wait for his guests arrival...but...

Akio began running his sword along the backs of his arms, watching the 
red stuff run out and stain his couch yet again. It slicked down the 
razor sharp edge of his blade, like hot oil. He sliced slowly and 
carefully, making sure it went deep enough to make him feel good. He 
sighed in contentment as he kept cutting...kept slicing.

...maybe he would just have to start his little party a bit early.
