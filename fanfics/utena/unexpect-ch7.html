<h1>The Most Unexpected Thing (part 7 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/unexpect-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        &quot;The free sword competition,&quot; the announcer&#39;s voice loudly 
declared, &quot;the free sword competition with begin soon!&quot;

        &quot;Juri,&quot; Wakaba murmured, the brown haired younger girl safe in 
the gentle circle of Juri&#39;s comforting arms.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri said softly, finally letting her go.

        Wakaba looked up at Juri, a bit startled, &quot;For what?&quot;

        &quot;I had a moment there,&quot; Juri said softly, &quot;when she was winning. 
Then I looked over and saw you, and it became easy.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Wakaba blushed faintly, a smile on her face.

        Juri hesitated, a blush appearing on her cheeks as the orange 
haired duelist looked down into those eyes. &quot;There&#39;s something I want to 
tell you,&quot; she said softly, &quot;will you meet me after the free sword 
competition..&quot;

        Wakaba reached up, putting her finger on Juri&#39;s lips. She took a 
deep breath, then with a smile said, &quot;Juri, I think I love you.&quot;

        &quot;I was... I mean I was going to..&quot; Juri stammered, then she 
grinned, pulling Wakaba close to her once again, &quot;I love you, too.&quot;

        &quot;Ahem,&quot; Miki cleared his throat uncomfortably. Juri gave the 
blue haired boy a look and he shrugged, &quot;Sorry, but we&#39;ve got to get 
ready.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll see you later,&quot; Juri released her reluctantly.

        &quot;You&#39;ll win, Juri,&quot; Wakaba smiled as she walked back to her 
seat, &quot;see you!&quot;

        Shiori had the oddest look on her face, watching the two of them 
together. Nanami looked at the violet haired girl, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

        A muscle in Shiori&#39;s jaw jumped as she clenched it hard. &quot;No, 
I&#39;m not,&quot; she said to her softly. The look on Juri&#39;s face, the joy in 
it, it was something she hadn&#39;t seen before. &#39;Wakaba makes her happy,&#39; 
Shiori admitted, &#39;happier than I ever did.&#39;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Nanami said simply, her golden hair tied back in a 
simple braid. Shiori looked at her in surprise, hearing the gentle 
sincerity in her voice. Nanami smiled wryly at the look on Shiori&#39;s 
face, &quot;I know what it&#39;s like to love someone who doesn&#39;t love you.&quot;

        Shiori hesitated, it was clear the girl wanted to say something 
biting. Instead she simply said, &quot;Yeah, I guess you do.&quot; She looked back 
to where Juri and Wakaba were reluctantly parting and asked, &quot;How do you 
manage?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not a very good example,&quot; Nanami admitted, &quot;I lashed out at 
anyone he dared care for.&quot; She paused thoughtfully, &quot;I suppose I 
eventually just had to let it go.&quot;

        &quot;It can&#39;t have been that easy,&quot; Shiori said softly.

        &quot;No, it wasn&#39;t,&quot; Nanami quietly acknowledged. &quot;I still have some 
feelings for him, but... it&#39;s not that obsessive love. I care for him, 
but that&#39;s it.&quot;

        &quot;I suppose you don&#39;t give lessons?&quot; Shiori asked half seriously.

        &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Nanami gave her a slight smile.

        &quot;Wonder what they&#39;re talking about?&quot; Miki asked, nodding to 
where Shiori and Nanami had their heads close together, talking 
intently. The two had slipped away to change out of the fencing gear to 
their duelist&#39;s uniforms.

        &quot;Good question,&quot; Juri murmured, swinging her sword cautiously, 
limbering up her arm. She looked up to see Touga and Saionji doing 
similar preparations, both of the young men entirely focused on their 
actions.

        &quot;You heard about how we&#39;re going to be doing these duels?&quot; Miki 
asked curiously, his own rapier humming as it cut through the air.

        &quot;Rose duels,&quot; Juri quietly agreed, &quot;just like in the arena. I 
wonder who made that suggestion, our acting chairman?&quot;

        &quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Miki agreed. He frowned, his eyes 
narrowing thoughtfully, &quot;I do wonder why, though.&quot;

        &quot;If Utena does get defeated in the duels,&quot; Juri noted, &quot;he needs 
to know which of us could seriously challenge him. So, we fight here 
among ourselves.&quot;

        The referee walked over to the scoring board, where the order of 
the free sword bouts was being set up. Miki would be fighting against 
Juri first, then Saionji, and finally their student council president, 
Touga himself.

        &quot;You know,&quot; Miki said hesitantly, &quot;I am going to be going 
against you all out, right?&quot;

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t expect anything else,&quot; Juri smiled at her friend, 
&quot;you know that. And I&#39;m glad that you decided to compete, even with this 
whole mess.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Miki gave her a salute with the blade he carried, 
even as the referee called out a minute warning before the start of the 
duels.

        The announcer&#39;s voice came over the hall&#39;s speakers, &quot;The 
contestants will be doing a unusual form of dueling today. Each will 
wear a rose in their breast pocket, and the winner will need to cut away 
the loser&#39;s rose. A test of skill, these will be impressive matches.&quot;

        Juri was a bit surprised to see Anthy there, holding the roses 
dressed in her usual school girl&#39;s uniform. An orange rose was put into 
Juri&#39;s pocket as the girl smiled, &quot;Good luck, champion.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri smiled wryly.

        Anthy strode over to Miki, placing a blue rose in his own 
pocket. Instead of a circle a large square had been cleared, with posts 
set up to define the edges of where they could do. It was a generous 
territory to fight in, allowing the competitors room to move.

        &quot;Fighters, to your positions,&quot; the referee called. Juri and Miki 
each took their place, gazing at each other intently. &quot;Ready,&quot; the 
referee paused a moment, &quot;fight!&quot;

        The two fighters moved almost at the same time, swords coming 
together with a ring of metal on metal. Swords slipped along the length 
of the blades as Miki tried to slip under her guard, but Juri quickly 
countered that. There were broad smiles on each face, both clearly 
enjoying the competition as they fought for minutes.

        Later on Juri couldn&#39;t really explain what she saw, the opening 
that she used to win the match. Maybe it was because of how well she 
knew Miki, maybe it was something else. All she knew was that her sword 
moved, slipping by the boy&#39;s guard to send the petals of a blue rose 
blowing away on a gentle breeze.

        &quot;Arisugawa wins!&quot; the referee declared excitedly.

        Miki stood there, a stunned look on his face, then he grinned. 
&quot;Congratulations, sempai,&quot; he beamed, offering his hand.

        &quot;Thanks, I...&quot; Juri started, only to be hit by a flying glomp.

        &quot;Juri!&quot; Wakaba squealed, &quot;That was incredible!&quot;

        &quot;Five minute break between matches,&quot; the referee called, &quot;Five 
minutes.&quot;

        &quot;That doesn&#39;t give you much time to regain your strength,&quot; Miki 
frowned.

        &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Juri smiled as she looked down at the 
beaming Wakaba, &quot;with you cheering me on I can&#39;t loose.&quot;

        Wakaba laughed softly, tightening her arms around Juri&#39;s neck. 
&quot;I could stay like this forever,&quot; she sighed happily.

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Juri agreed. &quot;But I&#39;ve still got two matches to go 
before I can rest,&quot; she said softly.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting,&quot; Wakaba slipped free, walking back to her seat 
by Utena and Anthy.

        Miki looked a bit surprised, looking at the group sitting there. 
&quot;Is it me,&quot; he mused as they walked towards a bench to sit, &quot;or does 
Shiori look happy you won?&quot;

        Juri looked towards there and nodded slightly. &quot;I guess anything 
is possible,&quot; she admitted.

        &quot;What do you think Saionji will do?&#39; Miki asked as they sat 
down.

        The green haired duelist was limbering up, performing generous 
swings with his katana. &quot;Power and speed,&quot; Juri noted, &quot;but I&#39;ve got 
something better.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Miki blinked.

        &quot;I&#39;m going to avenge my girlfriend&#39;s honor,&quot; Juri smiled 
nastily, &quot;I&#39;m going to make Saionji regret ever hurting her feelings.&quot;

        &quot;He&#39;s doomed,&quot; Miki agreed.</pre>
