<h1>Kakumei no Bara (part 6 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tanuki.html">Tanuki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/kakubara-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>He stood in the blackened remains of what was once a rather grand home. 
In what was once a grand drawing room, he stopped and kneeled. He 
crossed himself and proceeded to make a prayer for those poor souls 
that had died there. After a long while, he stood and moved to the 
mantle at one end; the only structure still standing. He rustled 
through the wreckage till he pulled out an ancient chair that&#39;s just 
sturdy enough for him to stand on. After a long time he pulls it off; a 
giant, ornately decorated metal cross. It was covered in soot and dingy 
from dust. Other than that, it did not look like it had suffered under 
the flames that had destroyed the rest of the house or the years that 
had past since then with so much as a scratch. It looked too big to be 
lifted by human hands, yet he lifts it without any problem. He heard 
the sound of feet crunching charred wood and turns. There is a rather 
meek looking priest standing there.

&quot;Um, sir; should you be doing this? I mean, father Katsuhito did tell 
you to not come here again.&quot;

&quot;I have a reason to be here, Amagasaki.&quot; He said it as he lifted the 
cross high enough for the small man to see.

&quot;Oh sir, you shouldn&#39;t have that! Father Katsuhito would be most upset. 
He specifically told you not to come here to get THAT. Think of all he 
did for you after he found you... here.&quot;

He merely turned his head, very slowly. Finally his eyes met the small 
man and they locked. The weaker cringed as he was forced to look in the 
eyes of the most dangerous person he ever had the opportunity to meet.&quot;

You read the letter too. You know what I have to do; but you&#39;re too 
crippled with fear of father Katsuhito to actually do anything to help 
me out. I have a chance to save the world.

&quot;The a-affairs of the world are not ours.&quot;

&quot;Coward! You would be perfectly content to sit in your little monastery 
and let the world fall apart around you. You don&#39;t care about the fates 
of these people. You&#39;re happy just as long as you are safe. Pathetic 
excuse of a man.&quot; He gestured with the cross. &quot;Look around you. This is 
what happens to those like you. This is what happens to people who ever 
have to cross paths with the Saint Killer.&quot;

He walked off into the night. As he did, he dropped two things onto the 
charred floor. One was an invitation to join the duels of Ohtori; the 
other was a photograph. In it were two very aristocratic looking people 
and one child. The child looked amazingly similar to the figure moving 
away.

Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Kakumei no Bara

Return to the Glorious Rose Covered Battlefield

The birds were singing and the sun was shining. It was the perfect day 
to start school. In the distance, departing ships were setting sail 
after depositing their cargo of students onto this Shirobara Island. 
Not even Utena could feel the trepidation that had been plaguing her 
for the past few weeks. Anthy hummed happily besides her. She was 
wearing her old school uniform; they would receive this school&#39;s girls 
uniform today. Though Utena had no doubt as to Anthy&#39;s alteration to 
this new uniform. She also knew that no matter what, she would wear her 
uniform; the uniform Anthy had sewn for her. She ran her hands down the 
rose colored material and sighed.

&quot;You could have gone with the white you know.&quot;

&quot;The pink looks better on you.&quot;

&quot;HA! You admit it. It is pink.&quot;

&quot;Utena, I&#39;m starting to think you don&#39;t like it.&quot; As Anthy said it, 
tears started welling up in her eyes. Utena panicked.

&quot;No, no it&#39;s not that. I like it I really do, but are you sure that the 
teachers are gonna be okay with it?&quot; Anthy&#39;s tears dried up instantly. 
She had Utena wrapped around her finger. She reveled in the power she 
had over her husband, but managed to keep her normal calm exterior.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. I am the chairman&#39;s sister. I&#39;m sure I can 
arrange something.&quot;

Utena merely groaned and walked on

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

They met Miki on a traffic overpass on the way to school. He was 
walking with Kozue. The twins had arrived on the island not long after 
them. Utena had not known how to react to Kozue pressing so tightly 
around Miki&#39;s arm, but had taken it in stride anyway. The couple sped 
up to meet the twins.

&quot;Oii, Miki-kun; wait up.&quot;

&quot;Eh? Oh Utena-san, Himemiya-san.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Tenjou-san now Miki-kun.&quot;

The smaller boy scratched his head. He still wasn&#39;t used to calling her 
by Utena&#39;s family name. He was barely adjusting to the fact that they 
were married; to each other no less.

&quot;Sorry, it&#39;ll take me a while to get used to calling you that.&quot;

&quot;How about just calling me Anthy? You and I are close friends. I would 
consider it an honor if you would refer to me by name.&quot;

&quot;I-I can&#39;t do that. I mean you&#39;re older than me and you are... you
are...you know.

She merely giggled and kissed him on the cheek.

&quot;I was the Rose Bride; now I&#39;m just another student, like you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not just another student.&quot;

&quot;No, I suppose you aren&#39;t.&quot; Anthy smiled and leaned back. She caught 
Kozue&#39;s eye as she glared at her. The girl&#39;s hungry, animal like eyes 
shone with something dark; almost threatening Anthy to stay away from 
her brother. Anthy fixed her with a stare of her own. Her eyes 
glittered with something almost evil. Kozue was taken aback. She closed 
her eyes and wagged a finger at her.

&quot;You are different.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been through many changed since we last met Kozue-chan.&quot; Anthy 
smiled again and sidled up alongside Utena.

The group was so engrossed in their exchange that they barely noticed 
the slight rise of a rather small sound. Utena was the first to notice. 
She stuck her thumb in her ear to stop the ringing.

&quot;Oii, anyone else hear some sort of weird-&quot;

&quot;Ringing;&quot; Miki finished for her.

&quot;Actually it sounds more like....&quot; Anthy couldn&#39;t quite place it.

&quot;Squealing.&quot; Kozue finished, calmly. She knew the sound well. &quot;It 
sounds like girlish squealing.&quot;

&quot;Oh no.&quot; Utena stated. She just realized what was going on. Her eyes 
screwed shut and her entire body locked up. Anthy took a step back and 
motioned for Miki and Kozue to follow suit.

&quot;Utena-sama.&quot; Wakaba squealed as she burst through the crowd and flung 
herself at Utena&#39;s back. They impacted hard, and it took everything she 
had to keep from falling over.

&quot;ImissedyouImissedyouImissedyouImissedyouImissedyouImissedyouImissed
you!&quot; She cried as she nuzzled into Utena&#39;s shoulder blades. Her arms
and legs were wrapped around and locked. Utena was trying to pry her
legs from around her waist. She looked over to Anthy, who only smiled
and cocked her head.

&quot;Help me.&quot;

&quot;Nope, I think you owe it to her as her friend to handle this 
yourself.&quot;

Utena sighed and turned her head, careful not to butt heads with 
Wakaba.

&quot;Wakaba, please get off of me.&quot;

&quot;No, not until we get to school. I haven&#39;t hugged you in so many 
months. I know you missed me. We&#39;re best friend and best friends don&#39;t 
go missing for months and don&#39;t say anything about it. Even when I got 
home, you didn&#39;t so much as hug me.&quot;

&quot;You ever wonder why?&quot; Utena muttered under her breath, trying to keep 
her balance with the other girl on her back. &quot;You&#39;re heavy ya&#39;know.&quot;

Utena chanced pleading with her wife for assistance, but found none. 
Sighing, defeated, she merely hitched her shoulders and started 
walking. Wakaba sighed happily and snuggled into Utena&#39;s back. There 
were certain advantages to using guilt.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

&quot;If a chick does not hatch from its egg, it will die without ever being 
born.&quot;

&quot;However; if it is born too early, it will die from exposure to the 
world.&quot;

&quot;A hen must then protect the egg to ensure that the chick is protected 
till it can truly be born.&quot;

&quot;We are the hens.&quot;

&quot;The world is the chick.&quot;

&quot;For the Protection of the World.&quot;

They sat around in the newly built student council room. Each of them 
placed a different colored rose inside of a rather plain vase. Three 
roses sat inside. On the table sat a ring. It looked like the average 
rose signet, save the black stone in the center.

&quot;One of us is missing.&quot; Declared an attractive green haired woman in a 
kimono. She was at least three years younger than the others, placing 
her at Utena&#39;s age. Her tone almost demanded an explanation. How could 
someone be so rude as to be late to a student council meeting?

&quot;Ah yes, the black rose. Don&#39;t worry Kamari, he will be along shortly. 
His journey will take a while more. Do not worry; his absence will not 
delay us in any way.&quot;

The woman merely sniffed and leaned back. She remained the perfect 
vision of refinement and femininity; all straight back and squared 
shoulders. The silver one&#39;s eyes then fixed on the other end of the 
table where another young man in navy blue sat. His long hair was 
pulled back into a tight ponytail, he didn&#39;t even have bangs.

&quot;Tianquing, how do you feel about the situation?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t really care about any of this. All I want to know is if this 
tournament will start soon. My sword itches for a fight.&quot;

&quot;Ah, ever ready to fight.&quot;

&quot;The sooner we start, the sooner I can win and get what I want.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; The silver one said with mocking wide eyes. &quot;And what exactly is 
it that you want?&quot;

All received was a glare through Tianquing&#39;s eye brows. &quot;That, Saito...
is none of your concern.&quot;

Finally Tianquing got up from the table and moved to the door. He 
didn&#39;t look back as he spoke.

&quot;If that&#39;s all the business we have to discuss then I&#39;ll be going.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s not all the business we have to discuss.&quot; Saito said, leaning 
against the desk. He enjoyed watching Tianquing stop dead in his 
tracks. His head turned and he looked over his shoulder. &quot;Oh?&quot; He 
asked, confused.

&quot;Yes, we still have one more matter to attend to.&quot; He said as he lifted 
some papers from the table. &quot;We still have to plan the school&#39;s 
inaugural ball. This is one of our roles as the student council.&quot; His 
smile grew as he watched Tianquing wilt. He fixed Saito with a dull 
gaze.

&quot;You&#39;re not serious, are you?&quot;

Saito merely shrugged and watched as the angry one fell flat on his 
face. 

Kamari giggled behind her hand. She hand&#39;t had this much fun in ages. 
She was going to enjoy this tournament and maybe earn some respect for 
her family; an old samurai clan.

And thus for the next hour, three people argued over the arrangements 
for a school dance. In the distance an alarm could be heard going off, 
announcing a coming train. Even further in the distance the train could 
be seen picking up speed as it left the station.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Utena and Anthy sat down to lunch. The cafeteria looked almost 
completely like the one at the other campus, the only difference being 
the large glass panes keeping the weather outside. Anthy stared at the 
small parcel on the desk in front of her while Utena nursed a can of 
soda. She turned to see Anthy idling with her ring.

&quot;Aw c&#39;mon hime, how bad can the uniform possibly be?&quot;

All Anthy did was move her chair back and gesture at the uniform she 
was currently wearing. Utena noted it with one part understanding and 
the other part approval. She noted the way the skirt rode up just a 
bit, exposing more of Anthy&#39;s thighs. She was starting to stare and was 
working very hard to resist the urge to drool.

Anthy did not miss Utena&#39;s gaze and felt her cheeks burn. She decided 
to play a little game with her love. She moved to fix the skirt, but 
instead moved it further up. She grew smug as she saw Utena shift 
further to the end of her seat. She leaned over, pretending to look for 
something and spread her thighs, giving Utena a nice view.

&quot;Would you two mind now doing that, it&#39;s disturbing&quot; Miki said from his 
seat, next To Anthy, he was trying to avert his eyes to the scene, but 
it just interested him too much. In his lap, Kozue wrapped her arms 
around him and glared at Anthy more.

&quot;Yes quite, we don&#39;t need you too rutting on the table now,&quot; Juri said 
as she took a sip of her coffee. She saw the two them stiffen and shoot 
back to their normal positions, blushing a very interesting shade of 
red. A ghost of a smirk flitted across her face and she took the time 
to notice Sakaya adjusting her uniform. The red collar and skirt of the 
uniform were definitely different, and the gloves were a curiosity all 
to themselves; opera length with buckles at the top. Tight leggings ran 
from ankle to underneath the skirts, preventing the cold weather from 
getting inside. &quot;Anyway, the outfit isn&#39;t so bad, at least it covers 
more.&quot; She pointed to the side where other girls were wearing their 
uniforms. Juri was right, it did cover more, but it was like some sick 
fetish, covering everything but hiding nothing. Anthy merely looked and 
blinked.

&quot;Now that I look at it; it is rather cute,&quot; she exclaimed and everyone 
else fell over. Utena struggled to the table first.

&quot;You can take her out of the school, remove the ties that bind, and 
show her brother for the insensitive prick that he is; but you can&#39;t 
take the weirdness out of her.&quot; Miki and Juri only nodded. Anthy only 
continued to smile, her eyes closed and her hands clasped under her 
chin. Sakaya and Kozue merely fidgeted with their outfits.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Touga walked the corridors of the building, getting acquainted with his 
new environment. Stopping in front of the door with Vice-Chairperson 
printed on it, he took a moment to adjust his uniform before entering.

&quot;eh-hem; I was told that you wanted to see me Ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Ah yes, Kiryuu-kun; its good to see you! Come inside. Take a seat.&quot;

Touga happily complied, taking the offered seat and looking around 
,surveying the structured disorder of this woman&#39;s office, so unlike 
her brother&#39;s. 

&quot;May I ask Ma&#39;am-&quot;

&quot;Please, call me Kami.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t have quiten enough respect for you yet to refer 
to you as such.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be a smartass, it doesn&#39;t suit you.&quot;

&quot;I apologize.&quot;

&quot;Anyway; I called you in here because we&#39;re both in a bit of a bind. 
You with having left your father&#39;s company so abruptly, and me with not 
having any form of an assistant right now.&quot;

&quot;Just what are you getting at.&quot;

&quot;Tell me Kiryuu-kun, how would you like to work in education?&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Anthy was walking to her second to last period of the day. She was 
walking with a girl from her class. They chatted amiably, about each 
other&#39;s history; well the girl&#39;s history and bit&#39;s and pieces 
rearranged to maintain the illusion that Anthy was an average high 
school student. The amiable conversation stopped suddenly as Anthy&#39;s 
acquaintance was smacked harshly in the face by a shadow. Anthy watched 
in horror as the girl flew across to the other end of the hallway. He 
took two steps back from her assailant, but it was too late. The figure 
leapt up from the shadows and grabbed her. She felt a cloth cover her 
mouth and soon she was breathing chloroform. The world spun around her 
and she saw black.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Utena walked to her last period class of the day. Her anticipation to 
get out was growing. The remembered another fact that made her speed up 
more.

She had her last class with Anthy.

As she got to the classroom she noticed something odd. There was a 
pretty big crowd forming around the door and hushed murmurs greeted her 
ears. She turned to one of the students who looked to be explaining to 
some people and motioned for him to explain.

&quot;It&#39;s pretty bad; someone killed one of the teachers and wrecked the 
classroom.&quot;

Utena&#39;s eyes snapped open. What if Anthy were in there when it 
happened. She pushed her way to the front of the crowd. A few police 
were mulling about, casting glances at a letter on the door. Utena 
rushed past them and grabbed the letter off of the door. She just knew 
that it was for her. They always were.

&quot;Hey, you can&#39;t come in here, that&#39;s evidence!&quot;

Utena spun around and presented the letter to him. She also held up her 
identification card.

&quot;D&#39;ya see who this letter is addressed to? It&#39;s for Tenjou Utena. D&#39;ya 
see whose name is on this card; it&#39;s Tenjou Utena! It&#39;s mine; so I&#39;d 
suggest you back off!&quot;

The crazed look in Utena&#39;s eye was enough to get the officers to back 
off. She ripped open the envelope and pulled out the paper.

There are some people who say it&#39;s not nearly as bad as you can imagine 
it to be. These are the same people who believe that things can&#39;t 
actually get any worse when it does happen...

...Those people are assholes.

The letter was simple enough to follow. Someone had Anthy and they 
wanted Utena to meet them in the greenhouse by the fountain. It wasn&#39;t 
even signed. That was inconsiderate. Utena crumpled the paper in her 
hands and dropped it as she started walking towards her locker. She was 
going to need her sword if she was going to fight.

The officers watched her drop the letter. They saw her drop it and 
spared a glance at it. They had to ask her questions about what it 
said. When they looked up again, she was gone.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The school&#39;s new greenhouse was enormous. It was an entire building, 
shaped like a silo. Vines and other plants sat in pots, just having 
been planted. In the center was a beautiful fountain. If anyone had 
looked down at it from the ceiling they would have seen a rose crest. 
None of this was noticed as Utena rushed into the building, screaming 
Anthy&#39;s name.

&quot;Anthy! Hime, where are you?!?&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama!&quot;

Anthy didn&#39;t call her Utena-sama unless she was really scared these 
days. As Utena neared the fountain, she saw something that made her 
blood run cold.

&quot;Hello, my dear Utena-chan.&quot; Ayani purred from where she stood. She was 
wearing a pale yellow duelist&#39;s outfit, and had Anthy handcuffed at her 
side. She was maintaining control with a firm grasp on Anthy&#39;s long 
hair.

&quot;Ayani!&quot;

&quot;Utena, please save me!&quot; Anthy&#39;s cry was punctuated as Ayani pulled 
hard on Anthy&#39;s hair. The smaller girl screamed and followed her hair.

&quot;Shut up cunt!&quot;

&quot;Ayani, what the hell is this?&quot; Utena said it as she readied her sword 
to attack. She was stopped as Ayani started laughing.

&quot;What in god&#39;s name is that? Are you going to hit me with your stick?&quot; 
Utena&#39;s temper sparked higher and she took a step to attack.

&quot;No, not just yet Utena.&quot; Ayani lifted her hand and revealed a rose 
signet. &quot;Like it? I got it in the mail. It came with a letter telling 
me to wear the outfit and lure you here. It also said to do this.&quot; She 
punctuated the remark by putting her ring in one of the twelve pillars 
surrounding the fountain.

There was an enormous rush of water as the edges of the fountain 
sprayed into the air. A rose gate rose up from the depths of the 
fountain and opened for Ayani. She stepped backwards into it and 
dragged Anthy with her. Utena ran to stop them from getting in when the 
doors slammed shut in her face. She impacted fists first. She tried to 
put her ring to the door, but realized that she wasn&#39;t wearing one. She 
looked down at her naked finger with a feeling of impotence. Panic rose 
in her and she started pounding on the door.

&quot;Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Please let me in!&quot; Utena 
started sobbing as she banged her head against it on the last tries, 
sobbing. Her tears ran unchecked as she begged the gate to let her 
enter. 

Then a miracle happened that not even Juri could dispute. 

A single drop flew from the gate. It fell to Utena&#39;s chest and 
splattered. Suddenly, a holy light built within Utena&#39;s breast in the 
shape of a rose signet. A beam of light connected the key mechanism on 
the gate to Utena&#39;s chest and a small bubble emerged from her breast. 
Then the light dissipated and a small gold ring fell from where the 
bubble had been. Utena&#39;s tearful eyes spied the ring as it hit the 
floor. It was a beautiful gold ring with a pink rose signet in the 
center.

Hope had been restored to her.

She immediately snatched up the ring and started to slide on the 
finger. As she did a figure somewhere, sleeping on an egg stirred. Its 
stone eyes started opening. It was responding to its new prince. As the 
ring slid further on, its eyes opened further. When the ring was all 
the way on, its eyes opened completely and their eerie green glow 
signaled something. The gates flew open and the resulting wind pushed 
Utena back. When the wind had passed, she looked inside. There was 
darkness on the other end of the gate.

&quot;That can&#39;t be, there shouldn&#39;t be anything behind that gate but the 
water fountain.&quot;

Deny it as she might, Utena saw a dark chamber behind the rose gate and 
she intended to enter it.

&quot;It&#39;s only an illusion created by Akio. I can handle this.&quot;

It was all she had to comfort herself as she stepped into the darkness. 
She looked around as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. It was a small 
round chamber; with a rose emblem in the center. Utena walked onto the 
emblem and waited. As she expected the disk started rising very fast. 
She felt heavy as it rose higher and higher into the sky. Then day 
broke.

She slammed to a stop in the arena. It was bright out, contrasting 
painfully to the pitch black of the chamber. She looked around to see 
the arena. It looked exactly the same as she remembered it. Exactly the 
same except for the young ladies standing on the far edge of the 
stadium.

&quot;Ayani, let Anthy go!&quot;

Ayani smirked at the comment. &quot;No, I think not. I won&#39;t just let her 
go.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t just let her go. Of course, you could duel me for her.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t duel you for her. The police are waiting for you down there. 
When they get up here-&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t get up here! Or have you forgotten? Only qualified persons 
are allowed in here. It said so in the letter.&quot; Ayani lifted her ring 
and laughed. Utena gritted her teeth. She had no choice, she had to do 
it.

She started unsheathing her bokken. As it came out, Ayani&#39;s smile grew, 
until she looked insane. When it was finally out, the bell started 
ringing. It was time to start the duel.

She released Anthy and pushed her on.

&quot;Do your job &#145;rose bride,&#39; get the roses.&quot;

Anthy complied and went to prepare them. She placed Ayani&#39;s rose on her 
chest and walked over to Utena.

&quot;Please be careful.&quot; She placed Utena&#39;s rose on her chest and leaned 
against her. Utena tilted her head up and looked in her eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t leave you.&quot; And she kissed her. When Utena looked 
up, she was smiling; Ayani was fuming though. She started rushing Utena 
right away.

&quot;Prepare to die!&quot;

Utena saw the rush and threw Anthy to the side. She picked up her sword 
and prepared to intercept the blow. Ayani swung and Utena blocked. 
Thankfully, her sword didn&#39;t break. They backed off and advanced again. 
Again their swords clashed and again Utena&#39;s bokken didn&#39;t break.

&quot;Hey, this thing is full of surprises. It&#39;s more than just some cheap 
hunk of wood.&quot; Utena&#39;s confidence grew as the worth of her sword was 
proven.

&quot;Go Utena!&quot; Anthy cheered from the sidelines. She stopped for a second, 
this moment felt very familiar.

Now it was Utena&#39;s chance to attack. She dashed and took several shots 
at Ayani&#39;s sword. Ayani backed off and tried a thrust. Utena dodged and 
tried to thrust through the break In Ayani&#39;s defenses. She backed off 
and swung her sword around. He rage had been steadily growing since the 
beginning of the fight. Now she was raging. She hefted he sword, 
preparing to use a death swing. Anthy&#39;s eyes widened; you were not 
supposed to strike to kill. They dashed again and Utena managed to 
block her attack at just the last second. Her eyes widened in horror as 
she saw chunks of wood go flying up. However, she couldn&#39;t stop since 
Ayani was still pushing. She pushed back hoping to hold it off till she 
could think of an alternative. Then something amazing happened. With a 
final push, she managed to push Ayani back; and saw the edge of Ayani&#39;s 
sword go flying. It had been sliced clean off. Utena looked down, 
shocked. In the sword, beneath the chunks that had been broken off, was 
a metal blade.

Ayani couldn&#39;t take it; she was going to lose Utena again. She looked 
down and glared at Anthy. It would be that girl that Utena would go 
home with. It would be that girl who got to hear Utena tell her that 
she loved her. She couldn&#39;t allow it. That girl had to die.

With what was left of her blade, she decided on a new strategy. She ran 
at the Rose Bride with an insane cry. Utena saw the attack and reacted. 
She threw herself in front of Anthy and dashed again. She had no choice 
but to strike with everything she had. She felt a familiar rush as a 
power she had though long since extinguished came into her body, 
feeling more right and more hers than ever before. She did not notice 
the slight glow her body took as it vanished from normal time.

Anthy barely saw what happened. She saw Utena jump in front of her and 
then there was a blur. The next thing she new Ayani was flying across 
the arena. There was a large slice across the front of her uniform and 
the pieces of her rose were flying around. She looked a few feet in the 
other direction and saw Utena crouched, the sword thrown to her side.

Utena was tired, she had thrown everything she had into that final 
slash and couldn&#39;t even bring herself to stand. Her body was quivering 
with exhaustion. She was gripping the sword so tightly she was sure 
that her hand was broken. She looked to the sword and saw cracks start 
to form all around the length of the sword. She loosened her hand and 
the sword shattered. Thousands of wooden chunks flew everywhere and 
something fell out. From the remains of the bokken fell a beautiful 
katana blade. It stabbed itself into the ground before the two girls. 
On its handle was inscribed the words &quot;Bara no Ken.&quot;

&quot;Anthy, what is this?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I think this is the real surprise that your aunt 
mentioned.&quot;

&quot;A sword.&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot;

Ayani only groaned from where she lay, unconscious.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The police took Ayani away, handcuffed. She had confessed to 
everything, and Anthy&#39;s testimony was enough to start things along. As 
she was driven away in a squad car, Anthy was having her statements 
taken by the police.

&quot;Are you sure that you don&#39;t want us to take you to a hospital.&quot; A 
young officer said as he noted the shivering Anthy. She had Utena&#39;s 
uniform jacket wrapped around her shoulders and she leaned against her 
beloved.

&quot;No, it&#39;s all right. I have sustained no injury and I&#39;d rather just go 
home. It&#39;s been a long day for me.&quot; She yawned the last part out and 
put more of her weight on Utena, who had a strange wrapped package in 
her other hand. She waved her hand and a strange glazed expression came 
upon the officers face.

&quot;Okay, have a nice day now.&quot; The officer gave up and walked back to the 
others. As he was walking away, Utena addressed Anthy.

&quot;What are you, a Jedi?&quot;

&quot;Maybe; like I said, I just want to go home. We can rest and maybe have 
a look at that sword.&quot;

Utena looked down at the package in her hand. &quot;Yeah, maybe we should.&quot; 
In the distance, a ships horn was blaring that it was coming into port.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the chairman&#39;s tower, Akio and Kanae sat in a movie theater, 
watching the proceeding on a movie screen. He munched absently on a bag 
of popcorn.

&quot;This was quite a show, Akio-sama.&quot;

&quot;Indeed dear wife; it was a fine show.&quot;

&quot;When do you think we should start transmitting to the rest of the 
school?&quot;

&quot;I think we should start at the qualifying round.&quot; Kami&#39;s voice piped 
in from the back of the theater. The shadows parted and she was 
revealed, with her feet propped on the chair in front of her.

&quot;Indeed dear sister, starting with the qualifiers is a fine idea. It 
will give the students a chance to garner support.&quot;

&quot;It will be a fine show.&quot;

They sat there, contemplating their next move. They sat there, long 
after the projector had shut off and cast them into darkness.
