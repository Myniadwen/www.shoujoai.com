<a href="../utena/bloodhonor-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The sun set, the nude Utena stirred from her slumber, and she felt the 
hunger stirring inside of her as well. The girls all awoke almost at 
the same time she did, and seemed to be aware of what was happening. 
The huddled together for a moment, and Utena felt a bit of relief on 
insisting that they dress and attend their classes again.

But each night they returned here, to be with her.

A brown haired girl separated from the group even as the others left 
them alone in the dorm room. &quot;Utena-sama,&quot; she smiled, bowing, &quot;my 
name is Hitomi.&quot; She began to unbutton her shirt, and Utena reached 
out a hand to gently stop her.

&quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; Utena asked her softly.

Hitomi met her eyes, and Utena was startled to see a hunger in them 
that almost matched her own. &quot;Please,&quot; Hitomi simply said softly. 
Utena silently took her hand in hers and pulled her towards the nearby 
bed.

Stopping beside the bed, Hitomi slipped her shoes and socks off, then 
she slowly unbuttoned her blouse. Her bottom wiggled enticingly as she 
slid the short skirt down, and then she undid her bra and pulled her 
panties down.

Utena sat them both down on the side of the bed, leaning over to kiss 
her gently. Her arms slid up to encircle her, and a part of her mind 
noted the vivid contrast between her own bone pale skin and the 
healthy pink glow of the other girl&#39;s. But mostly she was concerned 
with the hunger that was surging within her.

Hitomi lay back on the bed, her eyes made cloudy with desire. &quot;Oh, 
now, Utena-sama,&quot; she murmured to her softly, &quot;please, now.&quot; She 
arched her back, making her upper body available for Utena&#39;s every 
whim.

&quot;Forgive me,&quot; Utena murmured softly before bending over to gently run 
her teeth over the curve of Hitomi&#39;s breasts. The skin parted, and a 
rush of sweet blood filled her mouth.

Hitomi cried out softly, her hands rising to cup behind Utena&#39;s head, 
firmly holding her mouth to the wound. Utena tentatively stroked at 
the breasts, and Hitomi&#39;s soft cries of pleasure grew louder. 
Nervously, Utena let a hand slide down the taught belly, reaching the 
patch of curly hair, where she stopped, waiting for some sign.

&quot;Please,&quot; Hitomi asked again, and Utena let her fingers slide into 
wetness.



Wakaba glared at the leader of Utena&#39;s girl groupies. &#39;At least 
they&#39;re all wearing clothes,&#39; she thought irritably. &quot;I want to see 
Utena,&quot; she growled, &quot;so would you please get out of my way?&quot; She made 
to step forward, only to be stopped gently.

&quot;She&#39;s... a bit occupied right now,&quot; Keiko smiled.

&quot;What do you mean, occupied?&quot; Wakaba asked. Just then a particularly 
loud cry reached them, and Wakaba&#39;s eyes grew wide.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Keiko said to her quietly.

&quot;I&#39;ll think I&#39;ll wait,&quot; Wakaba sighed.

Not long after that Hitomi stumbled out of the dorm room, stars 
dancing in her eyes. The other girl&#39;s circled her, and she gushed, 
&quot;Utena- sama was incredible!&quot;

Wakaba visibly winced at that.

Utena walked out of the room a few moments later, pulling her uniform 
jacket on. She paused in the doorway, &quot;Wakaba?&quot;

Wakaba looked at her steadily, then she suddenly burst into tears. She 
felt strong arms enfold her, and a quiet voice asking what was wrong. 
And all Wakaba could seem to manage to say was, &quot;Why not me?&quot;

Utena pushed her back gently, her blue eyes questioning. &quot;What?&quot; she 
asked her softly, as if unsure of what she had heard.

&quot;Why not me, Utena?&quot; Wakaba asked her tearfully.

Utena closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them. Quietly, 
&quot;Because I care for you too much. I&#39;d never hurt you,. Wakaba.&quot; She 
leaned forward, and gently lay a chaste kiss on Wakaba&#39;s forehead. 
Then, she was gone.

Anthy watched them from nearby, her expression grave. Equally quietly, 
she made her way down the dark hallway, lost in her thoughts.

&#39;Why does it bother me, to hear her say that?&#39; Anthy thought, 
remembering the look in Utena&#39;s eyes as she said those words. No one 
in Anthy&#39;s memory had ever said something like that to her. And the 
caring in her eyes, her voice!

&#39;Tenjou Utena is a most unusual vampire,&#39; Anthy thought.



Utena walked the grounds of Ohtori on her regular patrol. She had only 
found one or two vampires so far, but the night was still young. &#39;And 
Kanae is still out there,&#39; she thought grimly. Something, some flicker 
of motion, brought itself to her attention.

Without turning around Utena said, &quot;Good evening, Juri.&quot;

Falling into step beside her, Juri smiled, &quot;Good evening to you, too. 
Could I invite you back to my dorm room?&quot;

Utena shook just a bit, remembering the night she had shared with 
Juri. &quot;No, thank you,&quot; she said quietly. She saw a look of 
disappointment quickly appear, then disappear on Juri&#39;s face. Softly, 
she asked, &quot;Why do you want me, Juri? I&#39;m sure there are armies of 
girls here that want you badly.&quot; A little smile, &quot;What makes me so 
special?&quot;

&quot;Armies of girls,&quot; Juri echoed, adding with a little smile, &quot;I guess 
that&#39;s the problem.&quot; They reached one of the benches in the rose 
garden, &quot;Sit for a moment?&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Utena agreed, sitting down. Juri gave her some space, 
taking the other end of the bench, and Utena felt a little flash of 
disappointment. She looked across the garden, the flowers almost black 
in the night, and remembered what they had looked like in the 
sunlight.

Juri looked up, the moonlight making her look almost like a statue. 
&quot;When I first became a vampire, I made a strange discovery. I found 
that after a little time anyone I spoke to would begin to agree with 
me,&quot; she said. A impish smile, &quot;At first, I enjoyed it. All those that 
had snubbed me or cut me down were now easy pickings for me. But 
eventually, I realized that this gift was also a curse.&quot;

&quot;A curse?&quot; Utena asked.

&quot;I talk to someone, and I don&#39;t know if what they say is because they 
want to, or my will compelling them to say what I want to hear,&quot; Juri 
said sadly. &quot;Even Shiori, who I love, is swayed by the power of my 
will. Only a vampire who is my equal will not fall under my spell,&quot; 
she said, looking up to meet Utena&#39;s gaze.

&quot;Why not turn Shiori?&quot; Utena asked her gently.

&quot;Then she will be bound to me as her creator,&quot; Juri said, &quot;and fall 
even deeper under my control.&quot; She smiled, &quot;But you, you are special, 
Utena.&quot; Softly, &quot;Of all of us, only you faced Akio&#39;s power and 
prevailed.&quot;

Utena closed her eyes, and Wakaba&#39;s face appeared in her mind. &#39;That 
one time,&#39; she though, &#39;I was hungry, and nearly made her...&#39; She 
opened her eyes, noticing Juri looking at her and quietly admitted, 
&quot;It&#39;s happened to me, as well.&quot;

Juri reached over, gently taking Utena&#39;s hand. &quot;You&#39;re the first woman 
to say no to me in months,&quot; she said with a wry expression. &quot;To me, 
that&#39;s almost a great a gift as if you&#39;d have said yes,&quot; she laughed 
softly.

&quot;You&#39;re very welcome,&quot; Utena smiled.

&quot;There&#39;s no one else here who could be your equal,&quot; Juri said softly, 
&quot;and certainly no others who could be mine.&quot; She reached out, gently 
brushing Utena&#39;s cheek as she asked, &quot;Would you consider....&quot;

Utena reached up, cupping that cold hand between her own. &quot;I can&#39;t 
promise anything,&quot; Utena said softly, &quot;but after everything is over... 
maybe.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri smiled up at her, and they both got up from their 
seat. They took a few steps apart, when Juri stopped and quietly said, 
&quot;I understand that Wakaba and Anthy are looking for Kanae&#39;s lair.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Utena asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know where it is,&quot; Juri said softly, &quot;but I wanted to warn 
you.&quot; She took a breath, &quot;Kanae may be the most dangerous of us all, 
because she is completely mad. She sees no value in human like, not 
even as food.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Utena said softly.

&quot;Good,&quot; Juri answered, and slipped off into the night.

Lost in her thoughts Utena walked through the blessed silence of the 
rose garden, tensing only when she saw a figure lurking at the end of 
the trail. She took a few steps forward, then relaxed a bit when she 
realized it was Anthy.

Anthy stepped up to her, and gently slipped a white rose into Utena&#39;s 
pocket. At her startled glance Anthy simply explained, &quot;It looks good 
on you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena blinked, a bit thrown.

&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; Anthy smiled. She walked beside Utena for a bit before 
confessing, &quot;I heard what you said to Wakaba back at the dorm.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Utena answered. &quot;I saw you, hiding in the shadows.&quot; She took 
a breath, more out of reflex than any real need, &quot;I care for her, but 
not the way she wants.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Anthy answered.

&quot;Feel sorry for her, not me,&quot; Utena sighed. She looked up, her pink 
hair shining in the moonlight, &quot;Any luck finding Kanae&#39;s lair?&quot;

&quot;A few more possibilities to check, come daylight,&quot; Anthy answered. 
&quot;We&#39;ll find her, Utena, it&#39;s just a matter of time,&quot; she reassured 
her.

&quot;I just hope that not too many will die in the meantime,&quot; Utena 
sighed. &quot;There hasn&#39;t been any new bodies found, and only two or three 
vamps tonight,&quot; she reported, &quot;but it feels just like when a storm&#39;s 
coming.&quot;

&quot;I hope you&#39;re wrong,&quot; Anthy said quietly. </pre>
