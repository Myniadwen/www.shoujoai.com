<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 17 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>        The door to the patio slid open as the tall, pale blue haired 
woman walked out to look out at the night. She closed her eyes, tilting 
her head back as she summoned senses that no human could ever know. A 
slight smile teased her lips as she realized that Utena and her friends 
were on the move, she could feel it. It was finally time.

        Mrs. Ohtori smiled widened, sensing the one she wanted the most 
among them.. Shiori. The purple haired face appeared in her minds eye, 
and she felt her breath quicken slightly. &#39;Tonight,&#39; she thought, &#39;you 
will be mine.&#39;

        &quot;But Utena has friends and allies,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori noted aloud, her 
long black gown swirling around her legs. There were the vampires that 
followed her, the young women who willingly served her. Miyu and Saya 
were out there in the night, and others as well. If she was going to go 
claim her bride, she should be prepared.

        Grasping the railing Mrs. Ohtori closed her eyes, visibly 
gathering her strength. The very air around her began to shift subtlety, 
invisible currents of power running around her. Her eyes shot open, 
glowing an intense blue as she uttered a single word, &quot;Come.&quot; She 
reinforced her earlier call, sending out the command that it was finally 
time to act.

        &quot;We&#39;re crashing your party, Utena,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori murmured to 
herself softly. She walked out of the apartment and down stairs, a few 
of her servants already falling into place behind her. As she exited to 
the street, there were already seven people behind her. &quot;Wait for us,&quot; 
she smiled as they strode towards Utena&#39;s destination.

        Somewhere out in the night the group walked together, ready for 
battle. Utena and Juri took point, the girl groupies, Shiori, Wakaba and 
Ruka behind them. All were armed with wooden stakes, just in case the 
enemy should strike before they reached the party.

        &quot;Are you ready?&quot; Juri asked. Her long orange hair fluttered 
behind her like a wave, a little smile on the gorgeous vampire&#39;s face. 
Her long dress was loose, chosen to move easily in, the orange color 
matching her hair.

        &quot;No,&quot; Utena answered frankly, &quot;but I&#39;ll manage.&quot; The pink haired 
woman dressed in a simple boy&#39;s school uniform looked back cautiously 
before softly asking, &quot;How&#39;s Shiori doing?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s the question,&quot; Juri agreed. She hesitated, clearly 
conflicted, &quot;You really think that she and Mrs. Ohtori... that she 
hasn&#39;t told us the whole truth?&quot;

        &quot;I hope not,&quot; Utena admitted, &quot;but that&#39;s what my gut is telling 
me.&quot;

        &quot;And yet you won&#39;t compel her to tell us, use your mastery as 
her creator to extract the truth,&quot; Juri said, giving Utena a thoughtful 
look.

        &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand when Akio attempted it on me,&quot; Utena answered 
softly, the look on her face unreadable, &quot;I won&#39;t do that to someone 
else.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re an idealist, Tenjou,&quot; Juri said, a smile gently tugging 
at her lips, &quot;I think that&#39;s why I like you so much.&quot;

        &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Utena made a face. &quot;Let&#39;s hope my idealism 
doesn&#39;t get us into more trouble than we can handle,&quot; she sighed.

        A little ways behind where they walked Ruka smiled, making his 
way over to Wakaba&#39;s side. &quot;So how was it?&quot; the blue haired young man 
asked her softly, his form fitting white suit striking in the near 
darkness of night.

        Wakaba went red, and Ruka chuckled softly. &quot;It was wonderful,&quot; 
she admitted, her curly brown hair bouncing on her forehead. &quot;Utena was 
so kind, so gentle, and Juri..&quot; Wakaba trailed off, her blush deepening.

        &quot;So they double teamed you,&quot; Ruka chuckled to himself wickedly. 
&quot;Are you happy?&quot; he asked her curiously.

        &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Wakaba smiled. &quot;I know that for Utena, Juri will 
always be first to her,&quot; the girl in the black dress said, &quot;But I also 
know that I&#39;m in her heart, and that&#39;s enough for me.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Ami spoke up, coming up beside them. She gave them a 
smile, &quot;Ruka-san, what do you think will happen? I and the others will 
do all we can for Utena-sama, but...&quot;

        &quot;If Mrs. Ohtori comes it&#39;ll be one hell of a fight,&quot; Ruka 
admitted, &quot;but I think Utena and Juri will prevail, especially with all 
of us supporting them.&quot;

        &quot;We will win,&quot; Wakaba said, almost like a prayer.

        Shiori felt a flash of irritation, one that she quickly 
suppressed. These fools had not a chance against her Mistress&#39; 
superiority, of that she was certain. A flash of memory, that blue 
haired beauty looking down at her as she stroked her slim body, the 
passion rising.

        &#39;I want to see her,&#39; Shiori thought, &#39;I need to feel that touch 
once again.&#39; She looked up at Juri and Utena, fingering the stake in her 
hand. &#39;I will do what I must,&#39; she silently resolved, &#39;to make sure that 
I will be with her once again.&#39;

        &quot;Shiori,&quot; Excel bounced over, almost frightening in her 
perkiness, &quot;are you all right? You had the oddest look on your face.&quot;

        Shiori strongly resisted the urge to throttle the young woman. 
It was difficult, but she managed it. &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she smiled 
insincerely, silently wishing that she would just go away.

        &quot;You look like you need a hug,&quot; Excel beamed at her, throwing 
her arms around the startled looking vampire and hugging her close.

        &quot;Ack..&quot; Shiori blinked, feeling the bloodlust rising. She 
forcefully pushed the girl away, blurting out &quot;Excuse me, gotta go.&quot;

        &quot;Aww,&quot; Excel pouted before returning to the other girls&#39; side.

        &#39;That was close,&#39; Shiori thought as she walked forward with the 
others. Her purple hair blew around her face, her fangs aching to be 
used as she wished she could feed once again. The feeling of having a 
woman in resting her arms, the pulse slowing down as the heart slowed 
down then came to a gentle stop. She missed that, the knowing that a 
life was in her hands.

        &quot;Juri,&quot; Shiori reached Utena and her former lover&#39;s side, &quot;what 
do you want me to do once we reach the nightclub?&quot;

        Juri gave her a slight smile, &quot;Hopefully we&#39;ll be able to have a 
little party.&quot; She brushed her hair back, &quot;But if we must, we&#39;ll fight.&quot;

        &quot;I look forward to it,&quot; Shiori breathed out eagerly.

        Utena gave her a look, but nodded slightly, &quot;Indeed.&quot; They 
walked on silently, until they came into sight of a blinking neon sign.

        The building was a converted warehouse by the look of it, a 
tough black haired young woman standing by the doors. Above her the neon 
glowed red, the words &quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket&quot; blazing out into the night. 
Just below it a neon locket opened up, revealing the face of a young 
woman.

        &quot;What took you?&quot; Ayaka Kisaragi asked, the red-haired Miko 
grinning as she leaned up against the wall in her long red dress.

        &quot;Utena,&quot; Anthy looked up at her, her eyes seemingly darker than 
they had been before. Beside her two women stood casually, a blonde in 
military gear and a gray haired young woman dressed in a finely tailored 
business suit.

        &quot;Anthy,&quot; Utena said softly. She looked over at the two women 
with her, then back at Anthy to ask, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

        &quot;Well enough,&quot; Anthy replied evenly. She gestured to the women, 
&quot;Tenjou Utena, I&#39;d like you to meet Victoria Ceres,&quot; she nodded to the 
blonde, then introduced the other with real fondness in her voice, &quot;and 
Integra Hellsing.&quot;

        Both Victoria and Integra glared at Utena, and Juri smiled 
wryly. &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; she offered her had, &quot;Arisugawa Juri.&quot;

        The look Juri got was almost as bad as Utena got, but Integra&#39;s 
good manners overwhelmed her irritation. &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; she said 
coldly.

        Ayaka looked greatly entertained by their interaction, looking 
back and forth between them. &quot;I take it there&#39;s been some changes since 
we last talked?&quot; she smiled.

        &quot;More than you know,&quot; Shiori spoke up softly.

        &quot;Never mind that,&quot; Utena sighed, &quot;is the place ready? I want to 
make sure that everyone inside knows what they&#39;re getting into.&quot;

        &quot;Arisugawa briefed everyone,&quot; the woman guarding the door said, 
&quot;everyone here knows there might be a vampire brawl tonight.&quot;

        &quot;Bones is right,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice rang out, &quot;and I know, too.&quot;

        There was a loud clattering noise, and something bounced along 
the ground before coming to a stop at Utena&#39;s feet. She reached down, 
picking up the long dark object and her eyes widened in surprise as she 
murmured, &quot;A sword?&quot;

        &quot;I had planned to stalk you,&quot; the black haired woman walked out 
of the shadows, &quot;hunt you down.&quot; There was the oddest scent around her 
to the enhanced senses of the vampires, much like their own but 
different somehow. &quot;Instead, you announced your presence,&quot; she said.

        Utena held the sword warily, looking at the girl. There was an 
aura of power about her, and danger. This was no normal vampire. &quot;Who 
are you?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;I am Saya,&quot; she drew her sword with a steely hiss, casting the 
hilt away casually, &quot;and I am the last of my breed.&quot; The weapon caught 
the light as she smiled coldly, &quot;I have dedicated myself to eliminating 
the mongrel breeds that have risen up in our place.&quot;

        &quot;So why are you here?&quot; Juri asked, the others moving to encircle 
the strange vampire.

        &quot;To test this one,&quot; Saya nodded to where Utena stood, the still 
sheathed sword in her hands. &quot;Will you accept my challenge?&quot; she asked 
her boldly.

        &quot;This fight is a waste,&quot; Utena finally said quietly, &quot;you know 
there are worse things than I out in the night.&quot;

        &quot;Do you accept my challenge,&quot; Saya repeated, meeting Utena&#39;s 
gaze.

        &#39;A zealot,&#39; Utena thought, looking into those deep, dark eyes, 
&#39;she won&#39;t be reasoned with.&#39; Utena took a breath, &quot;I accept.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; and Saya was on the move, sword gleaming in a deadly 
arc. Utena drew smoothly, parrying the blow in a flash of silver and a 
ringing of blades.

        &#39;She&#39;s good,&#39; Utena thought. She had barely seen the move, only 
parrying with the greatest of difficulty. There was a feeling of power 
in the air, like static electricity, as their wills fought invisibly 
alongside their gleaming blades.

        Saya smoothly struck, going for the neck in a wicked strike, but 
again Utena parried her. A feral smile tugged on Saya&#39;s lips as she 
realized that this wasn&#39;t going to be so simple. They moved almost like 
dancers, swords flashing as they fought back and forth.

        &#39;This one won&#39;t make it easy,&#39; Saya thought, &#39;good.&#39;

        Victoria drew one of her pistols out, the slim blonde muttering 
softly, &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be playing around like this..&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Anthy put her hand on Victoria&#39;s arm, &quot;Utena wouldn&#39;t want 
you to interfere.&quot;

        &quot;Besides,&quot; Integra smiled coldly, &quot;this match is almost over.&quot; 
At their questioning looks she added softly, &quot;Utena is better.&quot;

        Utena ducked under a strike, stepping in close to the off 
balance Saya. She struck, sweeping her sword right across the open belly 
in one swift motion. Saya staggered, a arm held across her belly, then 
she simply dropped to the pavement.

        &quot;Finish it,&quot; Saya uttered softly.

        &quot;You don&#39;t..&quot; Utena looked down at her in surprise, just a bit 
stunned to see a gentle smile on her face. &quot;Why?&quot;

        &quot;I am the last of my breed,&quot; Saya repeated, &quot;and it has been a 
long and lonely time.&quot; She closed her eyes, an expression of utter 
tranquillity on her face. &quot;Finish it.&quot;

        &quot;As you wish,&quot; Utena swung down once, separating head from body 
in one smooth strike.</pre>
