The woman knelt, running her hand through the ashes. She cupped a 
handful, letting it run out through her fingers, blowing gently on the 
breeze. She didn&#39;t know if it was Kanae&#39;s remains, or that of her 
servants, but she supposed it didn&#39;t matter.

The tall, pale blue haired woman smoothly returned to her feet, then 
she strode towards the dark buildings. She had made this place 
herself, years ago, created it to be a sanctuary and a refuge for 
Kanae. Remote, isolated, and with no officials of law hanging about, 
it was almost the perfect place for a vampire to hunt.

Her eyes narrow in anger, as she thought of the charming young man who 
had come to her. Handsome, smooth, he had seduced her with his charm, 
asking to be turned. She resisted at first, but eventually succumbed 
to drink deep of his sweet blood. She sent him to the academy, 
introducing him to Kanae as a consort for the troubled child.

But then things went so very wrong...

Akio was far too ambitious, and unrestrained in his hungers. Instead 
of feeding carefully on the students, he made others, and sought to 
build his power. Soon the place was crawling with his spawn, and he 
made his final error.

He made her.

Tenjou Utena. Just thinking that name made her grit her teeth. An 
image flashed in her mind, a pink haired warrior woman, thin, but 
strong too. The boy&#39;s uniform hugged her slim form, and her blue eyes 
seemed to pierce into one&#39;s soul.

She had slain Akio in battle, then hunted the members of the student 
council. And then Kanae... poor Kanae. Slain by this child, this newly 
made thing.

Ms. Ohtori&#39;s eyes narrowed, her fangs gleaming in the moonlight. The 
child will pay, her blood shed for Kanae&#39;s sake.

Not long after...

Juri grunted, a hand clenching her tightly around her throat. &quot;Where 
is Utena? Where has she gone?&quot; Ms. Ohtori coldly demanded.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Juri managed to get out, and was thrust hard up 
against the wall with bone rattling force.

It was insane, just mad. This woman had strode into the dorms, and 
beat Juri so very easily. After Kanae, Juri thought she was more 
prepared, but whoever she was, this lady was powerful. She fended off 
Juri&#39;s best blows with ease, a simple glance from her enough to stop 
Shiori cold. And then she got serious.

She ran Juri around the small room, punishing her with her powerful 
blows and her even more powerful mind, looking for only one thing. The 
location of Tenjou Utena, where she had gone after she left Ohtori.

Juri smiled bloodily, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; If she killed her, so be it. She 
wasn&#39;t going to tell her anything, anything at all.

&quot;I know,&quot; a quiet voice said.

&quot;No,&quot; Juri croaked, only to be hammered against the wall.

&quot;You know, little one,&quot; the tall woman smiled down at Shiori, her eyes 
meeting Shiori&#39;s.

Shiori&#39;s eyes were glazed, the woman&#39;s will washing over her. &quot;Utena 
and the others left, driving to Tokyo,&quot; her voice almost sing song.

Ms. Ohtori let Juri go, who without the supporting hand simply slid 
bonelessly to the ground. She cupped Shiori under the chin, gently 
tipping her head up. &quot;You were made by her, weren&#39;t you,&quot; she 
murmured.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Shiori said breathlessly.

&quot;That could be useful to me,&quot; she murmured softly to herself. She 
pulled Shiori to her feet, smiling as she commanded her, &quot;Come with 
me.&quot; She turned and strode down the hallway, Shiori right behind her.

Shiori hesitated for a moment, looking back to where Juri lay in a 
pool of her own blood, then she scurried after her new Mistress.
The next night, and Juri lay abed, trying to recover from the beating. 
She tore a packet of medical blood open with her teeth, drinking it 
down as quickly as possible. She&#39;d rather be drinking down from one of 
the ladies, but the way she felt right now she&#39;s drain someone dry.

&quot;Take it easy, Juri,&quot; Ruka sighed. &quot;You&#39;ve got to regain your 
strength,&quot; the dark blue haired man added quietly.

Juri glared, &quot;I have to go after her, rescue Shiori.&quot;

&quot;How do you know Shiori didn&#39;t go with her willingly?&#39; Ruka had to 
ask.

Juri&#39;s eyes narrowed in anger, and Ruka stepped back nervously. She 
calmed herself visibly, and a wry smile teased her lips as she 
admitted, &quot;If that lady told me to go with her, I don&#39;t know if I 
could have resisted.&quot;

Ruka nodded, &quot;So what are you planning to do?&quot;

Juri scowled, &quot;Go find Utena, first off. I&#39;ll need her help to fight, 
and she needs to know what kind of woman is trying to chase her down.&quot; 
With a very nasty smile she added, &quot;Then we go after the lady and save 
Shiori.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; Ruka said calmly.

&quot;No, you&#39;re not,&quot; Juri frowned. &quot;It&#39;s far too dangerous,&quot; she started 
to say, when he raised his hands to stop her.

&quot;With Wakaba and the girls, they&#39;ll be traveling both days and 
nights,&quot; Ruka explained patiently, &quot;you need my help to catch up with 
her, at least.&quot;

Juri met his eyes, then nodded reluctantly, &quot;You&#39;ve got a point.&quot;

The two set out in a day or so, unaware that they were being watched.

Shiori sighed softly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Juri-sama.&quot;

Ms. Ohtori chuckled softly, &quot;She will be my hound. Running hither and 
yon, searching for Utena.&quot; A cold smile, &quot;I have tasted her blood, 
this Juri, and can find her any time I need.&quot;
