<h1>A Special Case (part 8 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/special-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Morning began long before I was able to deal. My whole body screamed 
at me while I shuffled around, getting things together for my trip to 
Kagoshima. I called Nikki at home and gave her the day off, changed 
the answering machine message at the office and generally puttered 
until it was time to get to the airport. 

Kagoshima was a big port and tourist area, but my flight was small, 
just a few businessmen, mostly higher class than me. I settled into my 
seat and prayed we didn&#146;t hit turbulence. I wasn&#146;t sure my muscles 
would be able to stand it. The flight was uneventful. I didn&#146;t sleep, 
though &#150; the two young men behind me were practicing their negotiating 
skills the whole trip. 

By the time I reached Kagoshima I was more than a little prickly. My 
body hurt, my head hurt, I was hungry and irritated. I figured this 
would be the best time to call this Saionji character and insist I see 
him immediately. I love doing that to &quot;important&quot; officials. There&#146;s 
nothing so satisfying as walking in to their offices, looking like a 
rumpled rag doll and watching their carefully constructed masks 
crumble.

Unfortunately, luck wasn&#146;t with me and Saionji wasn&#146;t in. Either 
office. Or home. I decided to give it a rest and find my inn, maybe 
get some food and take a long soak in the bath. And that&#146;s what I did. 

I was just returning to my room, feeling marginally more human, when 
the hotel manger called me to say there was a phone call. I stepped 
out to get it, conscious of the passers by pretending not to listen 
in. It was Saionji and he sounded pleased.

&quot;I&#146;m glad I caught you before you went to bed.&quot; I checked my watch &#150; 
it was only 21:00, but hey, maybe he went to bed early. &quot;I was 
wondering if you could come to my house tonight. I&#146;d rather meet you 
here than in the office &#150; too much paperwork and people always 
interrupting, you know how it is.&quot; Yup. I knew how he wanted me to see 
him, anyway. &quot;I&#146;m having a little party here &#150; nothing formal, a few 
business contacts and I&#146;d like you to come over. The drinks are good, 
at least.&quot; His laughter was genuine, and my eyebrows rose a little. 
Who was this guy fooling? He was trying to soft-soap me. I wondered 
why.

I agree to come over and he gave me directions. A short cab ride, 
outside the city proper. I looked forward to meeting him. Not. 
Yawning, I dressed in my new good suit, gave the shoes a spit polish 
and popped some more painkillers. Not every muscle in my body hurt 
anymore, just nine out of ten of them. I asked the cabbie to drive 
carefully, as I wasn&#146;t in a rush, but you know how they are. I think I 
picked up a few bruises on my bruises from being slammed around in the 
back.

The house we pulled up to was nice, no more. Upper middle class, 
spacious without being a mansion. Neatly kept, very pleasant garden &#150; 
nice mix of traditional Japanese and Western. I was expected and the 
door opened as I approached. A kid of about 15 with a serious face 
ushered me in and offered me a drink. I accepted. Saionji had been 
right &#150; the drink was *very* good. I sipped happily enough and 
pretended to be invisible. The conversation around me was mostly 
business; taxes, tariffs, trade, the like. I looked for the ringleader 
and my host, but couldn&#146;t see anyone who matched the picture. At last 
the kid approached me again and asked if I would follow him.

We walked through the living room, and out the side door, where a 
covered walkway led to a largish shed on the edge of the property. We 
stepped in and immediately I felt a rush of air as a man went charging 
by me, wielding a shinai.

I stepped back, but he had already come to a halt, his strike parried, 
his opponent&#146;s sword at his throat. The match was over; the two men 
saluted, bowed, then smiled and shook hands. Laughing, they turned 
towards me. The man who had lost the bout bowed briefly and walked 
past me, shaking his head ruefully. The other man stepped up with a 
greeting for me and a rumple for the hair of the 15 year-old, who bore 
it with good grace.

I checked out Saionji. He was tall, his hair pulled back into a loose 
unruly, ponytail. The thin lips I had noted in his photograph were 
fuller now and his smile no longer cruel. His eyes were the big 
surprise. In that picture from ten year ago they were bitter, 
unfulfilled; now they radiated good humor and contentment. I was 
feeling a little irritated &#150; I was 0 for 3 so far on my interviews. I 
might as well pack it in on reading people.

Saionji clapped me on the shoulder familiarly and asked me if I&#146;d 
accompany him to his office. He waved the kid along with us, which 
made him stand just a little taller. Nice guy. I wondered what had 
happened to him that had changed him so much.

We made ourselves comfortable, Saionji, the kid and myself. After 
drinks were refreshed, we got down to business. Saionji smiled broadly 
and said, &quot;You say you&#146;re looking for Tenjou Utena? How extraordinary. 
Who hired you?&quot; Then he realized what he had just asked and blushed a 
little. Waving his hand in front of his face, he looked abashed. 
&quot;Sorry, sorry &#150; client privilege and all. I wasn&#146;t thinking.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s okay,&quot; I said. &quot;I can&#146;t tell you, of course, but I&#146;ll say that 
it is&#133;a friend of hers.&quot; 

His eyebrows rose. &quot;A friend? She was very popular.&quot; He grew 
thoughtful. &quot;I owe Tenjou, I guess. I hardly remember her, but when I 
think about the Council &#150; you&#146;ve talked to Touga and the others, I 
suppose?&quot; I nodded noncommittally. &quot;Well, now. I don&#146;t know that I&#146;m 
going to be able to help you much. I remember her, of course &#150; popular 
girl, very athletic, we didn&#146;t get along well at first&#133;&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; I interrupted.

He looked up, surprised. Resting his hands on the desk in front of him 
he stared at them for a while. Then he looked at the kid and smiled 
ruefully. &quot;Because at that time I was a very unhappy person.&quot; He 
turned back to me. &quot;We quarreled over something&#133;someone. It got me 
expelled for a while.&quot; His eyes closed and he pressed his hands to his 
face. Pulling them away, he looked me in the eye and said, &quot;I had some 
problems then. But I don&#146;t care about that kind of stuff now. I left 
the Student Council before I graduated, focused on my grades, my kendo 
and got myself into a good college, far away from Ohtori. I found 
something more important than power, or even prestige.&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot; I asked. These Council members hadn&#146;t yet ceased to 
amaze me. I wonder what fireball Saionji was about to launch at me.

He smiled again, the weariness falling from his face. &quot;Love of course. 
What else can do that to us?&quot; He glanced again at the kid, who 
chuckled. &quot;When I was in college, I fell in love with an older woman. 
She was everything that the girls my age weren&#146;t. I asked her out and 
she refused. She said it wouldn&#146;t be seemly. I had never been refused 
anything before and it stung. I went away and brooded, then realized 
that brooding wasn&#146;t going to solve the problem. I spent several years 
just trying to figure out who I really was, stopped comparing myself 
to other people &#150; and I started to realize that you can&#146;t find 
happiness in things. I worked hard at kendo and realized that my 
teacher had told me that along time ago&#133;right before he had&#133;before he 
denied it.&quot;

Saionji sighed. &quot;Pour Touga. I hear he&#146;s a shadow of his former self.&quot; 
He sighed again. &quot;I found myself. You have no idea how important that 
was to me.&quot; He sipped from his glass, his face serious again. &quot;And 
when I had, I came back and asked her out again. And she agreed.&quot; The 
smile he shot me was infectious and I grinned a little with him. &quot;We 
celebrated our third anniversary last week. Daiichi here,&quot; he gestured 
at the boy, &quot;is her son from her first marriage &#150; and my good friend. 
Isn&#146;t that right, Dai?&quot; And Dai nodded and agreed. 

Despite myself, I liked this Saionji. He had gone through a lot, I 
could see that. But unlike the others, he had gotten *through* it all 
and come out the other side, a winner. Good for him. But that didn&#146;t 
solve my problem.

The same thought must have occurred to him. &quot;But that doesn&#146;t help you 
much, eh?&quot; He began to fiddle with an antique tanto that sat on his 
desk &#150; a dangerous paperweight, I thought. &quot;I&#146;m not sure I can tell 
you anything that might help you find Tenjou. She wasn&#146;t really one of 
us &#150; I remember that. After we&#133;quarreled, I harbored a grudge for a 
while, but when I left, I felt nothing towards her. I can&#146;t even 
remember what she looked like.&quot;

&quot;What about Himemiya Anshi?&quot; I asked. The change in him was 
astounding. Once again, my client&#146;s name worked like a magical 
incantation.

&quot;That was it! That was her name! I remember now!&quot; Saionji looked as 
surprised as I felt. &quot;My god, I&#146;ve been trying to remember that name 
for years!&quot; He stood and walked around the desk. Taking my hand he 
pumped it convulsively as he spoke. &quot;Thank you &#150; that was it! I can&#146;t 
believe I forgot her.&quot; At last he released my hand and stood, a saved 
man by all accounts. He shook his head in wonder and pleasure.

&quot;Well, now, that was it.&quot; He came back to the present and smiled that 
infectious smile again. &quot;I may seem a simpleton to you, but I&#146;m not 
you know. Himemiya Anshi was the name of the girl we quarreled over. I 
remember it being very important at the time. I thought I loved her, 
but you know &#150;I never really did. I feared her. I feared them all, 
because I was always comparing myself to them. The last time we 
fought, I felt, I don&#146;t know, freed somehow and it all became so much 
less important to me. I tried to tell Touga&#133;&quot; his voice petered out 
and he stopped, staring.

&quot;Tell Touga what?&quot; I prompted.

&quot;I don&#146;t remember.&quot; He said, his brows drawing close. &quot;Something 
about&#133;&quot; He clicked his tongue against his teeth, frowned, then his 
face cleared. &quot;Nope. Sorry. I can&#146;t remember. It was a long time ago 
now and not very important, you know.&quot;

Not to this man, perhaps, but to the others, it was still an 
unanswered puzzle.

&quot;So you can&#146;t tell me anything about her that might help me find her?&quot; 
I asked, sounding more defeated than I felt. 

Saionji looked unhappy at not being able to help me. &quot;I am sorry. I 
hardly remember them.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s okay.&quot; It wasn&#146;t, I was getting nowhere, but it was all 
interesting, wasn&#146;t it? I stood and thanked him for his time and the 
drink. He offered to get me a cab, but I decided to walk back to the 
inn. I do my best thinking when I walk and I needed to get my sore 
muscles warmed up. The night air was warm and wet, and sounds were 
muffled.

As I left the residential neighborhood that Saionji lived in, the 
night around me grew darker, more unreal. I was pretty well lost in 
thought when something behind me made a noise. I turned just slightly 
too late and the last thing I remember was the darkness of the night 
going sickly green, then black again, as I passed out, and the noise I 
made as I hit the ground.
