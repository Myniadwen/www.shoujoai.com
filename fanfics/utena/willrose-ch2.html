<p>A/N: I figure that this fic is taking place fairly soon after Utena fought Touga</p>
<p> Rose Gambit</p>
<p>I  stood outside the door that lead into my dorm room; the door that led  to Anthy; the door that lead to the place where my choices had been  stripped from me much like the clothes had been stripped from my body.</p>
<p>I  shivered. The East Dormitory was creepy at night. It was creepy during  daylight too, but then I could pretend it wasn't. There was nobody here  at all and that cliche came to my mind. <em>No one to hear you scream.</em> I realized that I would rather be in the same room with Anthy then be  out here alone. So I opened the door and went into our room.</p>
<p>The  lights were out. Anthy must have decided to go to sleep. I squinted my  eyes, but I couldn't see into the corner where she slept. Luckily, I  knew the path way to my bed will enough, though I did bark my shin on  my own bed post. I flopped down into my bed.</p>
<p>It was then that I  felt the warm body beside me. I tried to jump away, but Anthy was  quicker. She scrambled onto my back, pushing me down into the bed. I  tried to buck her off, but she only hooked her heels into my sides and  held on with more strength.</p>
<p>I gave one final heave, then fell back onto my bed, disgusted with myself. Anthy settled herself more comfortably on top of me.</p>
<p>&quot;Anthy, what do you want?&quot; I growled, knowing all too well exactly what she wanted. A fight. She wanted to see me beautiful.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, Wakaba is right,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  have no good reason to protect me. You really should leave. And yet,  you stay.&quot; She bent down and spoke into my ear. &quot;Why is that, do you  think?&quot;</p>
<p>I could feel the moister of her warm breath in my ear.  She combed my long pink hair out of the way with her fingers, then drew  a path with a single finger along my neck.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, didn't move, didn't do more than breath, holding tremors at bay with nothing but strength of will.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I know.&quot;</p>
<p>I  couldn't help it, I had to ask, and again as before I dreaded the  answer. &quot;Why?&quot; the word came out shakier than I meant it to be.</p>
<p>I  felt Anthy bend toward my neck again, and she placed her lips against  it. But she did not kiss my neck, only spoke softly against my skin.  &quot;You want me like this. You want me to force you, like I did before.  You're ashamed of it, but you need me. But you know what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;  To my shame I could hear the need in my voice, because she was right.  The other night, I had not wanted what she did to me. But now, I  couldn't get it out of my mind.</p>
<p>Anthy's lips moved up and her  nose dipped inside my ear, then her lips brushed against it and she  whispered directly into it. &quot;I've learned my lesson. Do know what I've  learned?&quot;</p>
<p>My whole body was thrumming. I couldn't say anything at all, I could only groan. She smiled. I could feel it against my skin.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to consent. This time, you must to ask for it.&quot;</p>
<p>And then she was gone, sliding off my back in a rustle that was the sound of her lace nightgown sliding across my back.</p>
<p>I rolled onto my back and stared at the ceiling. My body was thrumming with energy, but I couldn't move.</p>
<p>I  wanted... I wanted my lips to move. I wanted to tell her to go to hell.  I wanted to tell her to come back. It took a long time for me to fall  asleep.</p>
<p>Then next morning, I woke up furious.</p>
