<h1>The Most Unexpected Thing (part 6 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/unexpect-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Miki smiled slightly, watching the crowds filling up the seats. 
&quot;I see Wakaba&#39;s right up front,&quot; he reported to Juri with a slight 
smile.

        Standing nearby him Juri&#39;s orange hair flowed down her back. 
&quot;Good,&quot; Juri looked up, meeting Wakaba&#39;s eyes and warming at the girl&#39;s 
happy smile. Utena and Anthy sat down nearby her, and Juri felt a bit of 
relief at that.

        &quot;You know they&#39;ll keep an eye on her,&quot; Miki softly reassured 
her, &quot;and now we have to concentrate on our matches.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Juri limbered up, the long white fencing uniform 
clinging to her body. She looked over at the other fencers, assessing 
them with her eyes, then let her gaze wander to where the free sword 
competitors awaited.

        &quot;Well, isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Miki murmured as they saw Nanami 
moving from the audience towards where her older brother waited.

        &quot;Isn&#39;t it?&quot; Juri agreed.

        Nanami walked forward, her long golden brown hair flowing down 
her back in a braid. &quot;Saionji,&quot; she nodded to the green haired 
swordsman, then moved on. &quot;Big brother,&quot; and her voice had an odd 
gentleness.

        &quot;Nanami,&quot; Touga smiled, his long red hair flowing down his back, 
a single lock dangling in front of his eye. He looked at her curiously, 
&quot;Are you going to be competing, too?&quot;

        &quot;I wasn&#39;t planning on it,&quot; Nanami calmly replied. She looked at 
her brother thoughtfully, &quot;You do know that Shiori&#39;s manipulating you, 
right?&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Touga smiled slightly. &quot;It&#39;s remarkably petty of 
her, trying to have Juri defeated so publicly.&quot; A soft chuckle, &quot;Now if 
it was you, Juri would be in far more grave danger.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Saionji said with a smile, &quot;Juri would be facing a real 
trial if she had angered you, Nanami.&quot; His face went grim, &quot;I still 
remember what you did to Anthy..&quot;

        &quot;Jealousy makes one do strange things,&quot; Nanami said to them 
simply. She looked over at Touga, &quot;So why are you going through with 
this?&quot;

        Touga smiled slightly, his hair blowing back from his face. 
&quot;When one is flat on their back,&quot; he smiled wryly, &quot;it&#39;s not very hard 
to get concessions from a person. But I did give my word, and I do 
intend to keep it.&quot;

        &quot;You two need to start thinking with your brains,&quot; Nanami pushed 
a lock of hair back from her face, &quot;not with your...&quot;

        &quot;Nanami,&quot; Saionji scolded her.

        Nanami sighed softly, shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;ll see you both 
later,&quot; and with that she headed towards the stands. She saw a figure 
enter the large fencing hall, and frowned as she made a straight line 
towards Wakaba. She moved to intercept her, gabbing hold of the 
beautiful woman&#39;s arm.

        &quot;Well,&quot; Shiori looked Nanami up and down, taking in the sleek 
duelist uniform that the blonde had chosen to wear, &quot;Are you competing, 
too?&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Nanami said crisply. She gave Shiori a frown, noting the 
overly tight school uniform she was wearing, &quot;Did that shrink in the 
wash?&quot;

        Shiori narrowed her eyes. &quot;I guess I should go to my seat,&quot; she 
tried to tug her arm free,

        &quot;You&#39;re not sitting there,&quot; Nanami said.

        &quot;Oh yes I am,&quot; Shiori smirked as she broke free.

        &quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Anthy sighed, watching Shiori stalk towards them.

        &quot;Suddenly, I&#39;m glad that you asked me to sit in the middle,&quot; 
Wakaba noted, sitting safely between Utena and Anthy.

        &quot;She tries anything,&quot; Utena promised, &quot;she&#39;ll regret it.&quot;

        But before Shiori could take the seat right beside Utena, Nanami 
was there. &quot;Would you mind?&quot; she asked them, plopping down so that the 
only spot left for Shiori was the one beside her, well away from Wakaba.

        Utena blinked. She didn&#39;t know why Nanami was actually helping 
Wakaba, but she wasn&#39;t going to question it. &quot;Sure,&quot; she smiled.

        Shiori sat down, scowling. &quot;What are you up to?&quot; she glared at 
Nanami.

        The blonde smirked. &quot;What, confounding you isn&#39;t reason enough?&quot; 
Nanami drawled. She looked out to where the matches had started, the 
lower ranking fencers moving against each other. &quot;I didn&#39;t like it, you 
believing I could be bought so easily,&quot; she said quietly.

        Shiori hesitated, looking over at the intense young woman&#39;s 
face. Finally she softly murmured, &quot;I misjudged you, certainly.&quot;

        Juri tensed, watching Shiori make her way towards Wakaba, then 
felt a flash of relief as Nanami acted. &quot;We&#39;re going to owe her one, 
later,&quot; Miki mused, watching the matches with an amused air about him.

        &quot;Probably,&quot; Juri agreed. The first sets of matches were nearly 
over, and Juri wasn&#39;t terribly impressed. &quot;Our turns are coming up,&quot; she 
said, &quot;be ready.&quot;

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Miki offered as Juri&#39;s name was called out.

        &quot;Luck is for amateurs,&quot; Juri shot back with a smile. She nodded 
to the referee, then looked over her opponent. A slim young man, a bit 
taller than Miki. He was trying to look confident, but there was 
something in his eyes...

        &quot;Begin!&quot; the referee called, and the boy moved. His sword 
flicked up, trying to make Juri flinch, but she calmly batted it aside. 
She saw an opening almost immediately, waited for a moment to see if it 
was a feint, then moved in, scoring the first point of the match in 
seconds. With a fierce look on her face Juri decided that this boy just 
wasn&#39;t worth her time, and scored the remaining points needed in only 
moments.

        &quot;I.. didn&#39;t even see you move, that last time,&quot; he took his mask 
off, looking up at her in awe. &quot;How..&quot; he trailed off.

        &quot;Get faster,&quot; Juri said to him simply, but she softened it a bit 
by adding, &quot;we may have a rematch someday.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; he grinned, moving off.

        Miki had won his match also, Juri noted as she made her way over 
to get a bit of water. The members of the opposition were all looking at 
her differently, almost fearfully. &#39;Guess they&#39;ve decided to believe in 
my reputation,&#39; she mused.

        &quot;Go, Juri,&quot; Wakaba cheered, and Juri found herself grinning.

        The next two matches were a little tougher, but not by that 
much. One scored a point on her before she took the tall redhead down, 
but other than that, the matches weren&#39;t tall that close. Miki made his 
way over to her, his face grave.

        &quot;There&#39;s at least one good fencer over there,&quot; Miki admitted, 
taking his protective helmet off. &quot;It looks like I&#39;m out, at least this 
time.&quot;

        &quot;Who is it,&quot; Juri asked him, unbuttoning the throat buttons of 
her suit, taking a deep breath then letting it out slowly, trying to 
relax.

        &quot;The blue haired woman,&quot; Miki nodded to where the woman was 
standing, &quot;she goes to the same school as that redhead who gave you 
trouble does.&quot;

        &quot;Graviton, right?&quot; Juri asked, feeling the blue haired woman&#39;s 
eyes on her. &quot;Strange name for a school.&quot; She took another drink of 
water, &quot;So who is in the finals?&quot;

        &quot;You and her, apparently,&quot; Miki said dryly, &quot;you both have been 
taking your matches by force, you know.&quot; He shrugged, &quot;This next one, 
it&#39;s just to see who gets third.&quot;

        &quot;Huh,&quot; Juri paid more attention, seeing it was the redhead that 
had nearly beaten her. The woman was both fast and skillful, and she 
finished her match in only a few seconds.

        &quot;You&#39;re up,&quot; Miki gave her a grin.

        Juri buttoned her jacket back up again, carrying the protective 
mask in her hand as she slowly walked to the ring, the blue haired girl 
doing much the same. &quot;Best two out of three,&quot; the referee reminded them, 
&quot;good luck.&quot;

        &quot;May the best woman win,&quot; the blue haired woman said, &quot;which of 
course will be me. Try to give me a good match, please?&quot;

        Juri pulled her helm on, a slight smile on her face. She didn&#39;t 
choose to answer her verbally, instead she simply raised her foil to the 
guard position, waiting. There was a flash of a smile from the blue 
haired woman, who took up a guard position of her own.

        &quot;Begin!&quot; the referee called out, and their swords came together 
with a clash. Back and forth they moved, silver blades flashing, 
searching for any weakness. The woman got her blade under Juri&#39;s, drove 
the sword up as she lunged in, scoring the first point.

        &quot;Nice,&quot; Juri admitted, stepping back a moment to try to loosen 
her arm. She couldn&#39;t believe the girl had pulled that off...

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; the blue haired girl nodded.

        Juri stepped back into the ring, feeling Wakaba&#39;s gave on her. 
The girl practically radiated a sincere belief in Juri, and she felt a 
strength rising in her, banishing tiredness. Juri moved, following up on 
a weakness she had seen in the first clash of swords, swiftly scoring 
her own point on the startled looking young woman.

        &quot;Nice,&quot; The blue haired girl echoed Juri&#39;s own words, her grin 
one of honest enjoyment.

        &#39;This is it,&#39; Juri thought as they came together again, swords 
flashing, &#39;this point wins or looses the match.&#39;

        The swords flashed back and forth, the audience watching rapt as 
the two women faced off. They were nearly the same height, their reaches 
nearly the same, and they were surprisingly evenly matched. For thirsty 
seconds, then a minute they sparred, each searching for an opening.

        &quot;There!&quot; Juri gasped as she struck, her blade resting between 
the surprised woman&#39;s breasts.

        &quot;Point, Arisugawa!&quot; the referee called, &quot;Arisugawa wins!&quot;

        &quot;JURI!&quot; Wakaba was off the bench like a shot, throwing her arms 
around the taller girl&#39;s neck and bouncing up and down, &quot;You did it!&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri hugged her, not caring about who might be 
watching.

        &#39;Juri won,&#39; Shiori thought to herself sourly. &#39;Well, at least 
Touga and Saionji still have a shot at her in the free sword 
competition.&#39;
