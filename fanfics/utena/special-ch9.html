<h1>A Special Case (part 9 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/special-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>I awoke in a tidy little Japanese room. The futon below me was 
comfortable enough and I decided to sleep again. I figured that 
whoever went to the trouble of putting me here shouldn&#146;t be insulted 
by me trying to mess everything up and leave. On that note, I passed 
out.

The sunlight was filtered by the rice paper, but bright enough to hurt 
through my eyelids. I rolled over and immediately regretted it. My 
head hurt in three places and my whole right side was throbbing. I lay 
back, gasping with the effort and trying not to throw up.

&quot;If you get sick, there&#146;s a basin to your right.&quot; The voice was cool 
and composed. &quot;It might make you feel better, you know.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; I hissed and hissed again as the pain of drawing in a breath 
took all my concentration.

&quot;You&#146;re pretty beat up, you know. You were lucky I happened to find 
you.&quot; The voice held some private amusement of its own &#150; I wanted in 
on the joke.

&quot;Thanks again.&quot; I tried to crane my head around to see the speaker, 
but it was no use. I gave up trying, closed my aching eyes and let the 
pain wash across me. &quot;Any chance of telling me your name, so I know 
who to send the thank you note to?&quot;

The voice laughed &#150; a pleasant, deep chuckle. If she was as lovely as 
her laugh, she was a knockout. 

&quot;My name,&quot; she paused for a second, &quot;is Arisugawa Juri. I believe you 
were looking for me anyway.&quot;

I could feel my strength ebbing. Great, so much for the element of 
surprise. My last thought as I slipped into a deep sleep was, what the 
hell was she doing in Kagoshima?

***

&quot;Tokyo?&quot; I said, astounded. How the hell did I get here? &quot;How long was 
I unconscious?&quot; I croaked.

Arisugawa Juri leaned forward and handed me a celadon cup with 
aromatic tea. I drank from it and was amazed again, this time by the 
flavor. I suppose by then I should have stopped being blown away by 
this woman&#133;but it hadn&#146;t all sunk in yet.

I woke up to find the light almost gone. Somewhere, the sun was 
setting. The room I was in had turned pleasantly cool and I sighed. At 
that, the shoji had slid aside and my erstwhile hostess had entered. 
From my position on the floor, she was all legs, right up to her 
armpits. I thought to myself that if *she* had been the one who came 
into my office, I&#146;d have never come to Kagoshima. She screamed &quot;femme 
fatale&quot; from her burnished copper curls to her arched eyebrows. In a 
remote way, she was gorgeous.

&quot;Good morning. I was getting worried.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; I said. She must think I have a one-word vocabulary.

&quot;It really is no problem. So far, you&#146;ve been a delightful guest.&quot; She 
knelt down and proceeded to wipe down my face with a cool cloth. Her 
fingers were long and tapered. I&#146;d have been glad to have them 
anywhere on my body. 

I sighed again. &quot;I didn&#146;t plan to spend another day here in 
Kagoshima.&quot; I said, my mind wandering a bit.

&quot;We&#146;re not in Kagoshima. We&#146;re in Tokyo.&quot;

You already know my reaction.

Her response was to hand me some good tea and wait for me to calm 
down. Her looks were long and searching, like she was looking for 
something in my face that should have been there, but wasn&#146;t. Or maybe 
I just had two black eyes and looked like a tanuki.

I sipped my tea and contemplated. I&#146;d obviously been unconscious a lot 
longer than I thought. &quot;How long have I actually been out?&quot; I asked in 
between sips.

She smiled. &quot;About two days. You slept through the entire ride here. 
Given the state you were in, I&#146;m not surprised. The doctors were 
afraid of internal injuries when they looked at you.&quot;

&quot;Doctors?&quot; I asked. &quot;Did you bring me to the hospital?&quot; I didn&#146;t think 
I could have been out that bad, but&#133;

&quot;No. My doctors. They are on call.&quot;

I sipped more tea and let the steam ease the tension in my face. I had 
at least one big lump, maybe more. I must have been a sight.

&quot;I expect you&#146;ll want to know how I found you.&quot; She said, sipping her 
own tea. I glanced at her from under my lids. She was long and lean 
and feline. A jaguar in human form. I could see plenty of strength in 
her, and more than a little killer instinct. I wondered why she was 
being so nice to me.

I nodded, and she continued. &quot;I&#146;ll be honest. I&#146;ve been following you 
for days. Since just after you met with the Kiryuu&#146;s. I saw you leave 
the building and something about you, I can&#146;t quite put my finger on 
it - or at least, I couldn&#146;t then. I think I can guess at it now.&quot; She 
fell into a reverie, as her voiced faded out. A moment passed and she 
snapped back into the present. &quot;In any case, I followed you to Kyoto. 
I&#146;ve been following you since.

&quot;I am sorry. I expected something like this would happen and I wasn&#146;t 
able to prevent it.&quot; She sounded abashed. &quot;You gave me the slip there, 
by walking back to the inn. I was waiting in a cab, but when you 
crossed the tracks I couldn&#146;t follow. At least I got there quickly. 
Otherwise no one would have found you until morning.&quot;

I nodded again, and found that it didn&#146;t hurt my head too badly. I 
poured myself more tea. &quot;So, &quot; I said slowly, considering every word. 
&quot;Thank you again for saving me. But that still leaves a few questions 
unanswered.&quot;

She looked away, her face solemn, withdrawn. Her profile was sculpted, 
sharp features, large eyes, high cheekbones. She could be a model and 
make the other girls around her look insipid.

&quot;Like, how did I get from Kagoshima to Tokyo unconscious? You look 
strong, but I doubt you carried me on your back.&quot; 

I hadn&#146;t intended it as a joke, but she laughed again and it 
transformed her. She looked less cold and aloof, more like a person 
I&#146;d like to be around. 

&quot;By helicopter, if you must know. That&#146;s how I got out to Kago&#133;&quot; she 
stopped and cocked her head. &quot;Excuse me one moment.&quot; And in a blink 
she was standing, then gone.

I could hear voices, one lower than the other. The shoji slid back and 
Juri walked in, followed by a shorter woman, whose pierced nose and 
short hair proclaimed her more modern than her friend. Their 
relationship was immediately apparent, and for some reason this made 
me kind of glad. The younger woman kneeled down by my side and laid a 
cool hand on my brow, then cheek. Just like my mother used to when I 
was a child. 

&quot;You look bad, but you feel much better.&quot; She grinned at me and bowed, 
slightly. &quot;I&#146;m Miiko, Juri&#146;s wife.&quot; I tried not to show how much that 
turn of phrase startled me, but she kept grinning and I realized that 
she did it to startle. Juri came to sit by Miiko and I could see by 
the pinkness in her cheeks, that she wasn&#146;t all that blas&eacute; about it, 
either.

&quot;So,&quot; Miiko continued. &quot;I hope you&#146;ve enjoyed our hospitality so far?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#146;m greatly indebted to you and Miss Arisugawa.&quot; I responded.

Miiko laughed out loud and nudged Juri. &quot;Miss Arisugawa. Huh, reminds 
me of the days when you were my teacher.&quot; I thought Juri was going to 
turn beet red at this abominable behavior, but she just smiled and 
clasped Miiko&#146;s hand in her own. Instantly, I knew that, like Saionji, 
Arisugawa had made it through. I was happy for her. Whatever demons 
still trapped the Kiryuu&#146;s and Kaoru, these two at least had escaped.

&quot;Miiko sat with you the entire first night, you know.&quot; Juri said to 
me. &quot;She may not look it,&quot; she ignored the rude noise the younger 
woman made, &quot;but she&#146;s a highly trained nurse. She felt responsible &#150; 
even with the doctors saying that all you needed was sleep.&quot;

&quot;You were burning with fever &#150; and bruised all over. I was worried!&quot; 
Miiko interrupted.

&quot;Oh, well, the bruises were from a tough judo workout a few days ago.&quot; 
I said, a bit sheepishly. Both women stared at me for a moment, then 
burst out laughing. After a second I found myself laughing along with 
them. It felt good. I guess I haven&#146;t laughed a lot recently.

I bowed deeply. &quot;Once again, my thanks to the two of you. I really do 
owe you a lot.&quot; They protested, but I felt like the least I could do 
was treat them to a nice dinner. They asked if I could eat Indian and 
I agreed. I hadn&#146;t had a good curry in a while. Japanese curry is too 
sweet for me.

Moti, by all accounts, is the ultimate Indian dining experience in 
Tokyo. We went to the Shinjuku branch. The food was excellent and the 
company pleasant. Juri turned out to be a retired teacher who had 
taken up modeling when her university had disapproved of her moving in 
with Miiko, an ex-student. 

&quot;It wasn&#146;t worth the hassle.&quot; Juri said. &quot;I had had modeling jobs all 
through school. I don&#146;t need to work, but I hate being idle. And 
modeling gave me a chance to travel. But it&#146;s hard work and ultimately 
empty. Now I&#146;m a photographer myself. It&#146;s much nicer on this side of 
the camera. And I enjoy it.&quot;

&quot;And she&#146;s great at it!&quot; Miiko jumped in. &quot;You&#146;ve probably seen her 
work and never known it. Her photography is everywhere&#133;make sure I 
show you when we get home tonight.&quot;

&quot;Um, actually, I was thinking I should be leaving&#133;&quot; I began, but Miiko 
interrupted - the usual state of affairs, I had gathered by this time.

&quot;No. I absolutely forbid it. You had a really bad concussion. At least 
one more night - I insist.&quot;

I reluctantly agreed. But the last thing I wanted was to be indebted 
to one of the people who was most likely to have caved my head in, in 
the first place.
