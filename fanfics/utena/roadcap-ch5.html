<h1>The Road to the Capital (part 5 of 12)</h1>

<a href="../utena/roadcap-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Anthy smiled to herself contentedly, snuggling in closer to the warm 
body laying beside her. She really didn&#39;t want to get up, but she knew 
that she had to. Anthy opened her eyes to meet Utena&#39;s gently smiling 
gaze.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Utena smiled, and kissed her gently.

Anthy&#39;s voice was a bit husky as she answered, &quot;Good morning to you, 
too.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;I suppose we couldn&#39;t just stay in bed.&quot;

&quot;Tempting,&quot; Utena admitted, &quot;but we&#39;re getting close to the capital. 
Personally, while I like camping I do prefer a comfortable bed.&quot;

&quot;I have fond memories of our bed back at the castle,&quot; Anthy smiled 
impishly.

Utena blinked at her, a bit of a flush appearing on her cheeks. 
&quot;Definitely time to get up,&quot; She grinned, &quot;before we decide to spend 
the day here.&quot; She slid from the blankets and swiftly pulled on her 
clothes. A quick brush of her hair, a peck on Anthy&#39;s cheek and she 
was off.

&quot;Drat,&quot; Anthy pouted, her hair standing up a bit around the edges.

Utena stood a moment, taking a deep breath of cool air while she 
looked around. The tents were already being pulled down and supplied 
packed under Miki&#39;s expert direction. A pot of porridge was cooking, 
Wakaba sitting at the fire watching it carefully.

Juri gave her a beckoning wave, &quot;Utena.&quot; Utena walked over to her 
second in command&#39;s side, looking her over carefully. Like always the 
orange haired woman looked great, dressed in gleaming chainmail and 
crisply prepared clothes.

&quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot; Utena asked her quietly.

&quot;I&#39;ve sent the scouts, Tsuwabuki and Keiko out,&quot; Juri reported 
quietly.

&quot;Good,&quot; Utena nodded, her eyes narrowing, &quot;tell them to keep their 
eyes open, please.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re getting closer to the capital,&quot; Juri said thoughtfully.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Utena agreed. She made a face, &quot;If someone really wants to 
stop Anthy from reaching the city, they have to make a move soon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell the troops to be on guard,&quot; Juri nodded.

&quot;Have the relief mounts ready, just in case,&quot; Utena added as she 
turned to go. At Juri&#39;s curious gaze, &quot;In the end, we might just have 
to run.&quot;

Juri strode off, and Utena looked around to try to find another person 
she wanted to talk to. She made her way through the group, eventually 
finding her at the edge of the encampment. Kneeling down, the woman 
collected samples of different herbs and plants, carefully putting 
them into pouches on her leather belt.

&quot;Utena,&quot; Shiori said, not turning from her task.

&quot;Shiori,&quot; Utena shook her head, &quot;I know I was being silent. How did 
you...&quot;

&quot;A girl&#39;s got to keep a few secrets,&quot; Shiori smiled. She rose to her 
feet, brushing her hands off on her leggings before asking, &quot;What can 
I do for you?&quot;

&quot;How long does it take to prepare the &#39;Dragon Slay&#39; spell?&quot; Utena 
asked her.

Shiori&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Not long.&quot; She looked over at Utena 
thoughtfully, &quot;Are you expecting some trouble?&quot;

Utena shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m hoping that this will be a quiet few days before 
we reach the capital, but...&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;You&#39;re guts are telling you different,&quot; Shiori said quietly. She 
smiled grimly, &quot;Considering that you&#39;re instincts are usually 
right...&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope that I&#39;m wrong,&quot; Utena smiled.

Back in the camp, Anthy blinked in surprise as a beaming Wakaba stuck 
her head in the tent flap, &quot;The porridge is nearly ready, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Anthy smiled, and followed her out dressed in a simple 
traveling dress. &quot;So,&quot; she asked her maid with a smile, &quot;have you 
noticed anyone new, lately?&quot;

A bit of a flush appeared on Wakaba&#39;s cheeks, &quot;Well, yes.&quot;

Anthy chuckled, patiently asking, &quot;Who is it?&quot;

Wakaba looked over to where Miki was organizing the supply wagons. 
&quot;Miki Kaoru,&quot; she admitted to Anthy shyly.

&quot;He is cute,&quot; Anthy admitted. &quot;Does he know that you&#39;re interested in 
him?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t told him yet, no,&quot; Wakaba said. She looked up at Anthy 
curiously, &quot;How did you tell Utena that you were interested in her?&quot;

&quot;A wasn&#39;t all that subtle,&quot; Anthy admitted as the porridge was dished 
up, &quot;I let her walk in on me while I was changing.&quot;

Wakaba snickered softly, &quot;I can just imagine the look on Utena&#39;s 
face.&quot;

&quot;Look on my face?&quot; Utena asked, walking up to them. She saw the smiles 
on both women&#39;s faces and raised an eyebrow, &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to 
know.&quot;

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Anthy smiled, getting a bowl for Utena. They sat down and 
ate their meal quietly, watching the goings on around the camp. Wakaba 
brought a bowl of food over to Miki, who smiled at her gratefully.

It wasn&#39;t very long before they were on the move again. Anthy&#39;s 
carriage was rolling along in the middle of it&#39;s usual group of 
guards, along with Utena, Juri and Shiori.

&quot;So what is the capital like, anyway?&quot; Shiori asked Anthy and Juri 
curiously.

&quot;Shi&#39;ohtori is an old city, one of the first founded by my ancestor,&quot; 
Anthy explained. &quot;A walled city, the center of which is the great 
castle of the Ohtori family, the seat of our rule,&quot; she said, her eyes 
shadowed by memory.

&quot;The castle was built on the rubble of a dark wizard&#39;s citadel,&quot; Juri 
added. &quot;After the first High King defeated him in battle the King and 
his family settled here, and much of the stones used in construction 
date back to that era,&quot; she finished.

&quot;That&#39;s not always wise,&quot; Utena frowned.

&quot;Did this wizard have a name?&quot; Shiori asked, a slight frown on her 
face.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure is the histories mentioned it,&quot; Anthy admitted. She 
concentrated, trying to call up the memories, &quot;I think it was... 
Mikage.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound familiar,&quot; Shiori said quietly.

Changing the subject Juri said, &quot;The city is the largest in the 
kingdom, with almost everything that one could wish.&quot;

&quot;Is it defensible?&quot; Utena asked thoughtfully, and received several odd 
looks. &quot;What can I say,&quot; she shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m a military woman.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s never fallen to outside forces,&quot; Anthy smiled at her love 
gently.

&quot;And never been betrayed by treachery,&quot; Juri finished.

There was a hawk&#39;s shrill cry, and Artemis dropped from the sky to 
land on Utena&#39;s arm. She unrolled the note, and her eyes narrowed 
grimly.

&quot;There&#39;s a large, unknown force ahead of us,&quot; Utena said, then loudly 
cried out to the guards, &quot;Battle positions!&quot;
