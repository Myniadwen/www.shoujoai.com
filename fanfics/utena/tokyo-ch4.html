<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 4 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Miyu looked at the two of them, and Utena felt a wave of power washing 
over them. The little girl&#39;s gaze was calm, relaxed even, as the 
pressure built on both her and Anthy. &#39;Not a little girl,&#39; Utena 
thought, &#39;she&#39;s old, so terribly old, I can feel it.&#39;

&quot;Tell me why I shouldn&#39;t kill you for coming here and disturbing my 
Himiko,&quot; Miyu&#39;s voice had dropped to a dangerous purr, and Utena knew 
that she meant each and every word. She gestured, and they were 
hammered by another wave of power.

Anthy dropped to her knees, a trickle of blood running from her nose. 
She clutched the sides of her head, moaning softly, trying not to fall 
to the ground completely. She managed to look up and gaped in shock, 
seeing Utena standing there, unbowed.

Utena grit her teeth, the power radiating from Miyu hammering at her, 
but she just refused to fall. From deep within her she felt something 
primal stir, like when she had faced Kanae. The power rose up from her 
gut, filling her with strength, a odd tickle coming from the back of 
her head as... something began to happen.

&quot;Utena-sama,&quot; Anthy murmured softly, almost reverently.

Anthy&#39;s eyes widened as the air itself around Utena began to move, a 
soft light shimmering all around the slim vampire. Her pale skin 
shone, her blue eyes almost glowing as she stared defiantly into 
Miyu&#39;s eyes. Another power, different than Miyu&#39;s, was building around 
Utena and driving the other power away from both of them. The pain, 
the pressure that Anthy had been feeling began to fade, and she gasped 
softly in relief.

&quot;Let go of me,&quot; Utena said defiantly, then there was a sudden burst of 
power as she raised her hands in a throwing gesture in front of her.

Miyu cried out in pain, taking a half step backward in surprise even 
as Larva and Himiko rushed over to her side. &quot;Are you all right, 
Mistress?&quot; Larva asked, even as Himiko knelt down beside her 
worriedly.

Utena offered Anthy her hand, &quot;Are you going to be all right?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Anthy answered softly, looking at Utena in both awe and 
a little fear. &quot;That&#39;s the sort of power an elder vampire has, not...&quot; 
she murmured.

Sounding quite rueful Miyu said, &quot;I think I&#39;m finally beginning to 
understand why Ayeka sent you to see me.&quot; She gazed up at Utena 
thoughtfully, &quot;How long has it been since you were changed into a 
vampire?&quot;

&quot;A few months,&quot; Utena answered.

Miyu, Himiko and even the masked Larva looked at her in surprise. 
&quot;Incredible,&quot; Himiko murmured even as Larva took a defensive stance.

Miyu looked at her a few moments, her own expression completely 
unreadable. &quot;Come here tomorrow night,&quot; she said, turning to walk up 
to the shrine.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Utena started to say.

&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Miyu&#39;s voice brooked no argument. Quietly she added, &quot;I 
need to consider what I&#39;ve seen tonight, before we speak again.&quot; 
Larva&#39;s long black cloak enfolded the three figures, and they simply 
disappeared.

&quot;I guess we&#39;re dismissed,&quot; Utena scowled, &quot;remind me to have a little 
talk with Ayeka about sending us to her.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think Ayeka expected that to happen,&quot; Anthy said, sounding 
clearly distracted. She looked over at Utena, her expression clearly 
shaken. It looked like she wanted to say something, but wasn&#39;t sure 
quite how.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t know how I did that,&quot; Utena said, a step ahead of Anthy.

They made their way across the city, eventually reaching their home. 
The doorman looked up from his paper and smiled, &quot;Your two guests have 
arrived.&quot;

&quot;Guests?&quot; Utena looked at him in surprise.

&quot;They were a young man and a woman,&quot; he shrugged, &quot;and someone from 
your suite said to send them up.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Anthy said as she rushed Utena to the elevator. The doors 
slid closed, and she looked at Utena, &quot;Do you think it&#39;s trouble?&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Utena said grimly. &quot;Someone may have followed us back, it 
might even be Miyu and her friend Larva,&quot; she speculated.

They reached their floor and the doors opened. &quot;We go in fast?&quot; Anthy 
asked as they hurried down to their suite.

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Utena nodded. She checked the door to see if it 
was unlocked, then met Anthy&#39;s eyes. &quot;On three?&quot; she asked.

Anthy nodded, drawing a stake from her clothes. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she said,

&quot;One.. two.. three!&quot; Utena shoved the door open, charging inside, 
battle ready. They hurriedly scanned the room, and saw...

&quot;It&#39;s about time you got back here,&quot; Juri growled, drinking from a 
packet of medical blood. The orange haired vampiress looked tired, 
somehow, as if she had been suffering from some kind of relentless 
strain.

&quot;I though we left you back at Ohtori,&quot; Anthy frowned. The young lady&#39;s 
dislike of Juri came through loud and clear in only one sentence.

&quot;We didn&#39;t have much choice,&quot; Ruka said as he stepped out of the 
kitchen. Carrying a steaming pan of food, the blue haired young man 
looked quite handsome, if you liked that type, but Utena didn&#39;t really 
care. She had other things to worry about.

Utena narrowed her eyes, quickly noticing that Shiori was nowhere to 
be found. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked.

Juri&#39;s cheeks flushed as she leaned forward in her seat, &quot;We were 
attacked, shortly after you left for Tokyo.&quot; She closed her eyes and 
ran her hand through her hair, &quot;She was even stronger than Kanae, and 
she was there looking for you.&quot;

&quot;And you refused to tell her anything,&quot; Utena nodded.

Juri looked at her in surprise, &quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;I know you pretty well,&quot; Utena answered with a smile, &quot;and you&#39;re 
still carrying bruises from your fighting her.&quot;

&quot;She beat me into the ground,&quot; Juri admitted, &quot;and took Shiori with 
her. She claimed that she could use her to find you.&quot;

That&#39;s certainly possible,&quot; Anthy nodded. She looked over at Juri and 
Ruka, &quot;Did either of you hear her name?&quot;

&quot;She called herself Mrs. Ohtori,&quot; Ruka offered.

&quot;I have certain... contacts. I can try asking them if they&#39;ve heard of 
her,&quot; Anthy said thoughtfully. Her eyes widened slightly and she 
looked at Juri in alarm, &quot;When you fought her, did she drink any of 
your blood?&quot;

Juri scowled, &quot;She licked some of my blood off of her fist, I think. 
Why?&quot;

&quot;If she&#39;s powerful enough,&quot; Anthy said very quietly, &quot;that might be 
enough for her to track you wherever you go.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hell,&quot; Ruka muttered.

&quot;Which means,&quot; Juri said, her voice harsh, &quot;she may have followed me 
right here.&quot;

Not far from the apartment, a figure sat in nearly absolute darkness. 
Mrs. Ohtori&#39;s eyes were closed, and an amused smile teased her lips. 
&quot;Juri&#39;s as smart as you thought, little one,&quot; she murmured to her 
companion.

Shiori nodded as she said, &quot;Juri has rarely disappointed me.&quot; She 
tilted her head to the side, her hair falling into her eyes, &quot;Do you 
think they&#39;ll bolt?&quot;

Mrs. Ohtori shook her head no, &quot;They consider themselves heroes. They 
won&#39;t run.&quot;

Shiroi stretched her slim, shapely body as she smiled and asked her, 
&quot;So should we do take them tonight?&quot;

&quot;Not just yet,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori murmured.

Shiori looked at her in surprise, &quot;Why, Mistress?&quot; She knew just how 
much Mrs. Ohtori wanted to avenge her daughter&#39;s death at Utena&#39;s 
hands. Mrs. Ohtori gave her a single look, and she involuntarily 
stepped backwards in fear.

Deciding to answer the question, Mrs. Ohtori said, &quot;Utena has 
attracted the attention of an old one.&quot; A grim little smile, &quot;Someone 
that I do not wish to cross right now.&quot;
