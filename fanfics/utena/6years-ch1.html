<pre>Hello friend, what&#39;s that you say? You say you&#39;ve lost your belief in
love? Ah, the one you thought you loved has caused you great pain. Yes
I do know what that is like. Me? Oh I&#39;m just a piano player, no one of
any real importance, but then as long as I have my music I am happy.
I&#39;ve learned a lot about love and happiness, some things I learned the
hard way. Such is life; some things must be learned the hard way so
that you&#39;ll pay attention to the important things. You say you think
your lesson was that there&#39;s no such thing as true love? I disagree, you
see I know differently. I know the truth about love and life. I learned
it from two people really, let me tell you the story of how they found
each other after six years of separation.

It had been six years. Six years since Utena Tenjou had disappeared from
the Ohtori Academy and almost everyone seemed to have forgotten her. I
say almost because there were a few of us who did remember. The most
important of those people was Anthy Himemia. At one time Miss Himemia was
the Rose Bride, and Utena was her prince. (It&#39;s a long story, one best
left for another time). To sum up the Duelists wanted the Rose Bride so
that they could gain the power to bring revolution to the world. Utena
got involved for other reasons. She didn&#39;t care about the power she only
wanted to help and protect Miss Himemia. Utena beat all the challenges
and then fought her final battle. Utena was badly injured during a duel
with the dean of students, and Miss Himemia&#39;s brother, Akio. After Miss
Tenjou was injured she vanished, but this is where I began isn&#39;t it? Back
to the tale at hand.

She had traveled across world looking for Utena. Searching everywhere
she could, finding little in the way of clues as to where Utena might
have gone. This held true for six years. It was nearing the anniversary
of when Utena vanished that Miss Himemia heard about a remote cottage
in the French woodlands that had the most beautiful roses. Very few
could find this place; it was very hard to get to. Anthy was quite
determined to find out about this cabin however and decided to go there
the following morning. That night she sat alone in room she had rented
looking at herself in the mirror. Her amethyst hair, now grown to her
lower back was lush and full. She still wore her wire-frame glasses,
her dark skin still soft after all the years of travel. A rustling from
her pack awakened her from her thoughts.

&quot;Oh Chu-chu! I&#39;m sorry I almost forgot you were there.&quot; She said as she
extracted the odd little creature from her pack. It looked like something
of a cross between a monkey and a mouse. Even I don&#39;t know where he came
from, but I do know that Chu-chu was Anthy&#39;s closest friend in the world,
next to Miss Tenjou of course. She spoke to Chu-chu that night about
her plans, her hopes of finding Utena, and of the love that she had for
her. She fell asleep talking to her friend, on the verge of tears. When
she awoke the following morning she readied her things and set out for
the small cabin in the woods. Oh! You want to know exactly where she
was going, that is best left unsaid, suffice it to say that it was in
a secluded woodland area in France. Sorry that&#39;s all you&#39;ll get from me
about location. As I was saying, she left to try and find the cabin in
question. Miss Himemia brought several weeks supply of rations with her
and set off into the woods. It took many days travel, and she was starting
to get worried that she might not ever find what she was looking for.

Then one misty morning the faint scent of roses filled her nostrils.
Anthy bolted up and followed the rose fragrance to a field. What she saw
when she got there nearly caused her to faint. Roses of all description
lined a large bed that was intersected by a path that led to a small
cabin. Anthy walked slowly down the path her breath getting heavier
from the nervous state she was in. She hoped beyond hope that she had
finally found her Prince again. When she got to the door she saw two
broken swords forming an X on the front of the door. One was a wooden
Kendo sword and the other was a shattered sword that had been given to
Utena by a female Duelist named Juri for reasons of her own.
Don&#39;t interrupt.

Anthy raised her hand to the door and knocked, softly. A million thoughts
raced through her mind as she heard footsteps heading toward the door. The
knob slowly turned and the door opened to reveal a young woman, slender
in form with long pink hair and eyes the color of the bluest sky.

&quot;Anthy?!&quot; The woman cried. As Miss Himemia stood before her love not
knowing what to do anymore. This day had been so long in coming that Anthy
had forgotten what to do. Utena grabbed her in an embrace and looked
lovingly into Anthy&#39;s soft eyes. Eyes that were filling with tears,
just as her own were.  &quot;Was this something like what you intended my
princess?&quot; Utena asked lovingly.

&quot;Oh yes Miss Utena!&quot; Anthy said. &quot;I&#39;ve looked for you for such a long
time; I had to find you Miss Utena, because I love you&quot;

&quot;I know my princess,&quot; Utena spoke tenderly, &quot;and I love you. I had to
leave Ohtori so we could both discover this on our own.&quot;

Anthy was crying softly at this point, burying her face in the warm
embrace of her prince. Utena spoke softly to her, comforting her long
lost princess. Anthy looked into the eyes of her life&#39;s love and Utena
into hers. They pressed their lips together and shared a kiss for the
ages. One that spoke of the truest of true loves. No longer would they
be alone, and no longer would anyone, not even themselves, keep them
apart. After they broke their kiss they looked out over the roses to
see all of the myriad beauties open their blooms at once. As Anthy
and Utena gazed at each other longingly a thought struck them, they at
last understood the power to bring the world revolution. Anthy felt her
prince&#39;s strong arms pick her up and carry her across the thresh hold
of what would be their home. Their palace built upon their mutual love.
To this day they are together, tending the roses and living life in the
glorious luxury of absolute, pure love.

What&#39;s that you say? What was the secret Anthy and Utena realized about
the power to bring the world revolution? Ah that is an easy question to
answer young lady. The power to bring the world revolution comes not
from magic, money, or any other power. The truth that they learned in
each other&#39;s embrace is that world revolution will be brought about by
the most basic and powerful of all-human emotions. Love.

I see my tale has gotten to you my lady, I did not mean for it to
affect you thusly. Who am I you ask and how do I know these things?
Well let&#39;s just say I am a dreamer and a firm believer in the absolute
power of love. Would you like to hear a song? I wrote it for occasions
like this. I call it &quot;The Sunlit Garden.&quot;
