<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 14 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<a href="../utena/revolution-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The morning came, and with it the meat of the trip: a
series of diplomatic meetings. From private offices to
government buildings Ambassador Dornlan patiently
explained his stance, trying to convince the undecided
or unwilling. Not normal was the ladies presence, his
daughter and the others trailing along for their own
safety.

&quot;The colonies should not take up a military posture,&quot;
Ambassador Dornlan said seriously as he stood in the
council hall, &quot;or they will be providing just the sort
of provocation that could start a war.&quot; The brown
haired diplomat took a breath before saying, &quot;Give
some time for those that want peace on Earth to work.&quot;

&#39;They aren&#39;t listening,&#39; Juri thought as she sat in
the visitors section along with Hilde, Releena and
Colonel Une, &#39;and even worse, they&#39;re looking at him
like he&#39;s some kind of crackpot.&#39;

&quot;Mr. Ambassador,&quot; one of the older men looked amused,
&quot;the colonies have never had a military, nor do we
plan one.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Gundams were launched from the colonies,&quot; a
young, vaguely weasel like man offered, &quot;but it was
done without official permission.&quot;

&quot;If it was official or not won&#39;t matter,&quot; Dornlan
looked like he was trying to be patient and failing,
&quot;it will merely serve as a pretext. The colonies must
follow the examples of their peaceful past and the
rulers of the Sank and...&quot;

&quot;Die,&quot; Juri murmured softly.

You could have heard a pin drop in the room as eyes
turned to her, Juri&#39;s voice carrying far more than the
orange haired girl had intended. The Ambassador looked
seriously annoyed at the interruption while the colony
representatives were all studying her thoughtfully.

&quot;And you are?&quot; the first man asked crisply.

&quot;My apologies, I shouldn&#39;t have did that,&quot; she smiled
wryly as she continued, &quot;and my name is Arisugawa
Juri.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s your opinion on this, Miss Arisugawa?&quot; an
older woman on the council leaned forward to ask her
curiously.

Juri hesitated, &#39;Is saying this worth the sort of
trouble I could get into? Yes.&#39; She took a deep
breath, &quot;I hold great respect for the Ambassador and
his principles, but I think they&#39;re simplistic.&quot; Juri
deliberately didn&#39;t look towards Releena or her father
as she continued, &quot;Appeasement didn&#39;t work with
Germany or during the Global Wars, I doubt it will
work now.&quot;

&quot;No one has spoken of war,&quot; the weasel remarked.

&quot;They&#39;re certainly talking about it on Earth,&quot; Juri
shot back. She smiled grimly, &quot;There&#39;s a strong war
movement on Earth, sponsored by a very powerful
patron.&quot;

&quot;Romafeller,&quot; Someone quietly murmured.

&quot;Who in turn draws much of it&#39;s financing from
companies that produce the Mobile Suits and other
arms,&quot; Juri nodded gravely. She felt Une stiffen and
fought back a smile as she thought, &#39;What, you thought
that no one would put the pieces together?&#39;

&quot;I object to any such insinuations,&quot; Une sputtered.

Another councilor, a younger man raised a hand to
silence Une while looking over at Juri thoughtfully.
&quot;Even assuming this is true,&quot; he said, &quot;what would we
do about it?&quot;

&quot;You have one untapped military resource,&quot; Juri
answered simply, &quot;the Gundams and the people who
created them. Contact the scientist and the
manufacturers even as you bring the Gundams home, as
some kind of peacekeeping force.&quot;

&quot;Stop the attacks on OZ?&quot; the first councilor
murmured.

&quot;Use the Gundams defensively, make the Specials attack
you first,&quot; Juri continued, &quot;it puts you in a better
position, both diplomatically and tactically.&quot; She
smiled grimly, &quot;And if it does come down to a war,
you&#39;ll have your forces gathered and ready.&quot;

There was a babble of conversation between the
councilors, voices over lapping each other then the
chairman got control. &quot;Thank you for your comments,&quot;
he looked around at the people at the table, &quot;I think
we&#39;ll call a halt for the day.&quot;

The group filed out, Juri looked up at the Ambassador
nervously. Oddly the brown haired man was smiling
slightly, his expression oddly contemplative. &quot;You cut
my legs right out from under me in there,&quot; he finally
noted.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to lie,&quot; Juri answered him calmly, &quot;and
I figured that they could make up their own minds,
given the facts.&quot;

&quot;You really think that pacifism is simplistic?&quot;
Dornlan asked.

Juri shrugged uncomfortably. &quot;In a finer, more noble
world it could work,&quot; she answered, &quot;but not in the
world we&#39;re living in now.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Dornlan looked thoughtful, &quot;then maybe we need
to change the world.&quot; With that he excused himself,
speeding up to walk beside Une.

&quot;Was all that about the Specials and Romafeller true?&quot;
Releena asked. The brown haired young woman looked
oddly serious, somehow, and Juri hoped that what
happened last night hadn&#39;t been the cause. Even
stranger was the gold chain that Releena had begun
wearing around her neck, something round dangling from
it beneath her shirt....

&quot;I did some research on them after the fire at Ohtori
and the charges were dismissed,&quot; Juri had a haunted
look in her eyes as she answered, &quot;it took some
digging but the information was there, if you knew
exactly where to look.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Releena put her hand on Juri&#39;s arm and
squeezed it comfortingly.

&quot;I&#39;m getting over it,&quot; Juri said, forcing a smile.
Changing the subject she said, &quot;Is it true your father
is cutting this mission short?&quot;

&quot;Mission?&quot; Releena smiled quizzically. When Juri
didn&#39;t answer she continued, &quot;The Earth government is,
yes, they feel the threat of further terrorist attacks
is too great.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Juri grunted. &#39;I meant to look into Heero Yui
while I was here,&#39; she thought, &#39;but so far I&#39;ve found
nothing, looks like it was an alias.&#39;

&quot;Disappointed?&quot; Releena asked.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Juri admitted honestly. She smiled slightly
as she looked over at Hilde, &quot;Except for the terrorist
attack, everyone&#39;s been pretty friendly.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Hilde smiled wryly, her short brown hair
a touch messy.

&quot;Can you escort everyone back to the hotel?&quot; Juri
asked Hilde, &quot;I need to run an errand, if we are going
to be leaving soon.&quot;

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Hilde asked.

&quot;I wanted to visit the grave site of your former
leader Heero Yui,&quot; Juri said calmly, &quot;I thought I
should pay my respects.&quot;

&quot;Strange,&quot; Releena murmured, &quot;that he and our
classmate are both named Heero.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Juri headed off with a steady stride.

The trip across the city was remarkably easy, and
again she found herself noting how pleasant most of
the people in the colony were. Obviously they were a
bit wary of a strange face, but they willingly offered
directions or assistance as needed. The colony was a
large structure, yet also oddly confined floating
there in the void of space.

The marker there was a simple one, the name Heero Yui
and dates, much like the ones on Earth. Juri stood
there a moment, her simple dress flowing around her as
she thought of the young man she had slain back on
Earth. &#39;This isn&#39;t your grave,&#39; she mused, &#39;but I&#39;m
hoping you rest in peace, wherever you are now.&#39;

&quot;Miss Arisugawa,&quot; the quiet voice said.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Juri answered calmly. She had seen the old man
walking nearby, his hair long and gray with small,
round glasses over his eyes. One of his hands was
gone, replaced with an artificial limb, and he seemed
to bear the weight of a great responsibility.

&quot;My name is Dr. J,&quot; he nodded, &quot;and it was quite the
bold suggestion you made before the colony council
today.&quot;

Juri turned, her long orange hair blowing in the
artificially generated breeze. &quot;I won&#39;t ask how you
know about that,&quot; she said mildly. She took a breath,
&quot;Just attacking OZ won&#39;t prevent a war, you have to
get their backers, too. Not to mention the politicians
who support such foolishness.&quot;

&quot;There are those who support war here, too,&quot; Dr. J
noted.

&quot;One thing at a time,&quot; Juri answered softly.

&quot;We were both familiar with the young man who carried
that name,&quot; he nodded to Heero Yui&#39;s grave, &quot;and I
understand you inherited something that once belonged
to him.&quot;

&#39;Who is this man?&#39; Juri wondered. &quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot; she
answered cautiously.

He smiled, &quot;I think Heero would have approved.&quot; Dr. J
looked deadly serious, &quot;Things are about to become
very exiting on Earth, you had best be ready.&quot;</pre>
