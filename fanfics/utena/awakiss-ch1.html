<h1>Awakened by a Kiss</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Utena Tenjou and Anthy Himemiya walked into the dorm that they shared, 
both looking a bit battle-weary, although Anthy hid it a bit better 
than her pink-haired &quot;husband&quot;.

&quot;I am getting so tired of all this CRAP,&quot; Utena muttered, putting her 
hand to her forehead, then wincing slightly at the twinge in her 
muscles. She jumped a bit at the touch of deft, elegant fingers on her 
arm, then settled down, eyes sinking closed, a small sound coming from 
low in her throat as the sore flesh was kneaded. &quot;Thanks, Himemiya.&quot;

&quot;Hai, Utena-sama... your sword arm troubles you...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve just been duelling so MUCH lately... I guess all that slamming 
swords together is takin&#39; its toll, huh?&quot; Utena offered Anthy a wan 
smile. &quot;Just, hopefully, I&#39;ll be able to get a few days rest... I&#39;ll 
be alright, then.&quot;

&quot;Sit down,&quot; Anthy cajoled. &quot;I&#39;ll make you some tea.&quot;

Nodding tiredly, the pink-haired young woman sat down at the small 
kitchen table. She smiled a bit at Chuchu&#39;s sleeping form curled up on 
the table. Utena rubbed behind the little creature&#39;s ear with a 
fingertip and saw him shift slightly, but not awaken. She looked up 
again as Anthy quietly set a teacup down on the table and poured it 
full before moving around to sit at Utena&#39;s side.

Utena grasped the teacup in long, slender fingers, simply holding it, 
staring into the dark liquid and feeling the heat soak through her 
sore palms to loosen them up. Shaking her head a bit, realizing that 
she must have been staring into her cup for more than five minutes, 
she sipped at the somewhat lukewarm tea, her eyes still lowered, 
almost unseeing. &#39;I&#39;m so tired...&#39; She lowered the teacup, and felt a 
yawn slip loose, mouth stretched wide and eyes pushed closed. They 
blinked open as she felt a gentle tugging that took her by surprise, 
as she found her head abruptly lying in Anthy&#39;s lap. She was about to 
say something, but a hand softly stroking her hair drew forth another 
yawn and a soft shiver of relaxation.

She blinked awake, confused, not having realized she&#39;d fallen asleep. 
She could still feel Anthy stroking her hair, and humming softly, a 
soothing, almost subliminal sound that wrapped around her and through 
her and loosened knotted muscles as much as any massage. The thought 
about sitting up flitted through her mind but left quickly, instead 
transmuting somewhat into rolling over so that she was lying on her 
back, looking up at the dark-skinned girl. Anthy smoothly changed her 
petting of Utena&#39;s hair to go along the soft pink bangs and along the 
top of her head, Utena&#39;s hair falling all across Anthy&#39;s lap like a 
light pink blanket.

&quot;Sorry, Himemiya... didn&#39;t mean to drop asleep and use you as a 
pillow.&quot;

Dark reddish-pink lips turned up in a smile. Anthy&#39;s voice was soft, 
soothing. &quot;That is alright, Utena-sama. I don&#39;t mind at all. You 
needed the sleep.&quot;

Utena gazed up at Anthy, an almost questioning look in her eyes, as if 
searching for something there she wasn&#39;t quite sure of. Anthy simply 
smiled, continuing to pet Utena&#39;s hair, dark chocolate fingers 
stroking through silken pink hair. Slowly, but smoothly and with no 
real hesitation, Utena slipped her hands up and behind Anthy&#39;s neck, 
entining her fingers against that smooth dark skin, feeling strands of 
dark purple hair become trapped between her fingers. Pulling herself 
up and pulling the other girl down, Utena closed her eyes and pressed 
her lips to Anthy&#39;s, felt those lips, already soft and warm and 
yielding, obviously expectant, respond, press back against her own 
with loving tenderness.

Pale fingers entangled in dark purple hair and dusky fingers entangled 
in light pink hair, pulling one another closer. Anthy leaned back, 
Utena having shifted around to be somewhat above her, taking charge of 
the kiss, one of her hands sliding down to rest snugly on Anthy&#39;s 
lower back and pull her tight against her, purple hair sweeping away 
from Anthy&#39;s back and swirling around her body with the movement. The 
simple, soft kiss, just lips on lips, seemed to last forever; Anthy 
moved her hands to better keep her balance, one arm slipping around 
Utena&#39;s middle, her other hand coming to rest just below her 
&quot;husband&#39;s&quot; throat and to the side, the bottom of her palm resting 
against the upper swell of Utena&#39;s breast under the blue jacket.

Finally, as the kiss trailed off, light lips drawing away from dark, 
eyes opened slowly, faint slivers of color growing into half-lidded, 
loving gazes, sky blue meeting leaf green, like the horizon meeting 
over a beautiful forest. Their gazes spoke of a timeless love and an 
endless affection, the same gaze of Robin and Marion, of Lancelot and 
Guinevere, Antony and Cleopatra. Utena&#39;s fingers flexed lightly in 
Anthy&#39;s hair and against her back in a kind of tiny carress.

&quot;You&#39;ve been waiting for me to do that for awhile now, huh?&quot; Utena 
murmured, still losing herself in the emerald pools of Anthy&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Yes, I have, my prince... waiting for you to let go of what was 
holding you back...&quot; Anthy&#39;s soft smile penetrated deep into Utena&#39;s 
being, revealing to her what she&#39;d really been searching for; not the 
Prince, to show him what a good prince she herself had become, but a 
princess, to be the prince she had always been for. &quot;I&#39;ve been 
waiting, my love... to awaken you with a kiss.&quot;

Lips met again, tenderly, lovingly, eyes sinking back closed. Utena 
parted her lips, the tip of her soft, pink tongue touching against the 
warm, tender skin of Anthy&#39;s lips before those were parted as well, 
tongues meeting in a gentle dance. Anthy began deftly undoing the 
buttons of her prince&#39;s jacket and drawing it open, revealing nothing 
but smooth, pale skin and crinkled, erect nipples capping petite 
breasts. Anthy&#39;s slim fingers hooked into the jacket&#39;s collar and drew 
it down, Utena moving her arms so that the garment could be pulled 
off. Gently lowering Anthy to the floor, Utena went to work on her 
princess&#39; Rose Bride dress, smiling down at the beautiful image of 
chocolate brown skin surrounded by a wave of purple silk. She was 
delighted to find that Anthy had forgone undergarments as well, and 
was presented with the sight of firm breasts and dark, erect nipples. 
Suppressing the urge to dive right at them, Utena instead continued 
undoing bindings and tugging at the dress, Anthy squirming around to 
help, until she was laying naked on the floor, one knee raised up, 
hair spread out behind her like a fan, an adoring smile on her face.

&quot;Anthy,&quot; Utena whispered, tracing fingertips along her princess&#39; cheek 
in a feather-soft carress, drinking in every inch of her with her 
eyes. &quot;I love you...&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama...&quot; The Rose Bride&#39;s eyes shone with delight, tears of 
happiness threatening to burst loose. Her slender hands wrapped around 
Utena&#39;s one stroking hand, pressing it to her cheek. &quot;You called me 
Anthy.&quot;

Utena laughed softly, an easy, happy sound, her bangs carressing 
Anthy&#39;s as she lightly touched the tips of their noses together, eyes 
sparkling. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;ll try and not let it happen again...&quot;

They kissed again, lips and tongues meeting one another in a lovers&#39; 
dance. Anthy slipped her fingers into the tight material of Utena&#39;s 
shorts, hooking the waistband with her fingers and peeling the shorts 
down, taking her time, letting the cloth and her fingers carress 
Utena&#39;s skin. Shifting around so that her princess could remove the 
final barrier between them, Utena tried to resume her earlier position 
atop Anthy, only to accidentally straddle one of the other girl&#39;s leg. 
She gasped, and heard a similar gasp come from Anthy, her body coming 
to a total stop as she felt her dampening sex press against Anthy&#39;s 
smooth leg, a soft, wet warmth against her own leg that she knew must 
be the other girl&#39;s sex. Breathing a bit harder, Utena looked down, 
between the two of them, just to confirm that things were as she 
thought them. Gulping a bit, she looked back up, at Anthy&#39;s face. Her 
princess was breathing harder as well, breasts heaving, dark skin 
beginning to glisten slightly with a thin sheen of sweat.

Anthy entangled her fingers in Utena&#39;s hair, glittering green eyes 
locking on baby blue ones. &quot;Make love to me like this, my prince... 
please...&quot;

Utena&#39;s nervousness melted away like snow in spring. She smiled 
lovingly, leaning down, feeling their bodies fit more closely 
together, her smiling lips almost brushing against Anthy&#39;s as she 
spoke in a low, soft voice. &quot;Yes, my princess...&quot;

They kissed, eyes falling closed, as Utena tried moving her hips. Both 
girls moaned into one anothers&#39; mouths at the flashes of pleasure that 
raced through their bodies, shooting up from where their sexes rubbed 
against one anothers&#39; legs, down from where their breasts pressed 
against one another and rubbed together, meeting somewhere in their 
stomachs and setting off a fluttering, excited sensation. Giving their 
shivering bodies a moment to calm slightly, never ceasing the kiss, 
Utena began to move again, this time putting her whole body into it, 
moving more slowly. Both moaned again, but the pink-haired girl 
managed not to stop, continuing the slow stroking of their bodies 
together. She could feel the slickness of Anthy&#39;s arousal on her leg, 
her own honey wetting the other girl&#39;s skin.

Their growing cries of pleasure muffled against one another&#39;s lips, 
Utena began to move faster, taking advantage of the way their 
sweat-slick bodies slid easily against one another. At the furthest 
slide back, her breast slipped off of Anthy&#39;s and pressed against the 
underside. As she pushed back up, her breasts first pushed Anthy&#39;s up, 
then slipped on top of them, hard nipples brushing together in 
passing. By now, she was moving against the other girl so much and so 
fast, they simply couldn&#39;t keep the kiss up, their cries filling the 
room and echoing through the old, empty dorm&#39;s halls. Utena cried out 
between every hard, heaving breath, her voice mingling with Anthy&#39;s, 
feeling her clit and labia stroking over that dark as chocolate and 
smooth as silk skin. She barely had time to realize she was close 
before her muscles locked up, a scream escaping her throat as her 
entire body shook with an explosion of pleasure. She felt Anthy 
thrashing underneath her, heard the other girl&#39;s scream, felt a sudden 
gush of added wetness all over her leg. Her body abruptly relaxed, and 
she fell atop the dark-skinned girl, supporting herself on her 
forearms somewhat so that she wouldn&#39;t press too hard on her lover.

Panting, both of them slowly came down from the breathless highs of 
their ecstasy. Eyes inevitably drew towards one another, so that their 
gaze could meet. Both of them suddenly started giggling, eyes shutting 
lightly at their soft laughter, simply needing a vocal outlet for the 
joy they were both feeling. Eyes opened halfway again, sparkling, 
unable and unwanting to look away from the other. Utena rubbed her 
nose affectionately against Anthy, then kissed her softly. The girls 
traded short, light kisses, still reveling in this first-ever 
afterglow.

&quot;Mmm... that wasn&#39;t exactly gentlemanly, was it?&quot; Utena murmured 
between kisses, not repenetant in the least.

&quot;Well, if anyone asks...&quot; Anthy giggled, slipping her arms around her 
lover to entangle her fingers in soft pink hair. &quot;I&#39;ll tell them I 
seduced you.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Bout time, too,&quot; Utena replied with a chuckle. She kissed Anthy&#39;s 
eyelids. &quot;You seem different now... like the you I&#39;ve only caught 
glimpses of...&quot;

&quot;Utena-sama... don&#39;t you remember?&quot; Anthy smiled adoringly. &quot;The 
prince always awakens the princess with a kiss. Sometimes, it&#39;s not 
the body that&#39;s asleep.&quot;

&quot;Mmm... well... I wouldn&#39;t be much of a prince...&quot; Utena heaved 
herself to her feet suddenly, and Anthy yelped a bit as she suddenly 
found herself swept up into Utena&#39;s arms, one under her knees and one 
behind her back. &quot;If I let my princess sleep on the floor, now would 
I?&quot;

Anthy giggled as Utena carried her in the direction of their bedroom, 
slipping her arms around the other girl&#39;s neck, resting her head on 
her beloved&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Ne, Utena-sama, do you think we&#39;ll have many children?&quot;

&quot;You have GOT to be kidding me...!&quot;

As the young womens&#39; voices trailed into the distance, the lights in 
the kitchen clicked off by a deft movement of Anthy&#39;s foot, the only 
sound was a clock ticking from somewhere nearby. The room was cast 
into deep blue and black, shadows stretching across the table, cast 
from the teapot and cups. And, sitting partly in shadow, in the 
cross-legged, paws-on-elbows position he often assumed when waking up, 
was Chuchu... his eyes wide, a strange, shocked expression on his odd 
little face, skin having assumed a stonelike appearance with cracks 
running throughout.</pre>
