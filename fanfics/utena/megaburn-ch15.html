The Boomer staggered, leaning up against the wall as
it&#39;s eyes glowed faintly an odd, almost eerie green.
Then jerkily it began to follow behind other Boomers,
all of them slowly but surely migrating towards the
middle of the city, ignoring the panic and chaos of
the mercenary attacks and the police response.

Meanwhile in an office tower a urgent and extremely
tense meeting was taking place. &quot;You&#39;re insane,&quot;
Nanami blinked, the golden haired woman looking across
the desk at her guest with a expression of honest
disbelief.

&quot;No,&quot; Touga shook his head, long red hair flowing down
the stylishly dressed man&#39;s back, &quot;I think we can pull
this off. My own resources aren&#39;t small...&quot;

&quot;Miki?&quot; Nanami looked over at the blue haired man with
a frown.

Calmly Miki was typing figures into a computer,
roughing out a series of calculations. &quot;We can do it,&quot;
he finally admitted, &quot;but I think it&#39;d bankrupt all of
us.&quot;

Touga hesitated, &quot;I can&#39;t ask you...&quot;

Nanami looked at her older brother with a faint smile.
&quot;This could save a lot of lives,&quot; she said, &quot;and I&#39;m
proud that you came up with it. But are you sure?&quot;

&quot;For a long time now the money&#39;s just been a way of
keeping score in the game of business,&quot; Touga
shrugged, &quot;I&#39;ll manage.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; Miki said, &quot;though I can&#39;t say my resources
will add much. Should we call Arisugawa or Saionji
in?&quot;

&quot;Hold them in reserve,&quot; Nanami suggested, &quot;we might
need their help later.&quot;

&quot;That;s fair enough,&quot; Touga agreed as he moved over to
the desk that was normally used by a secretary. &quot;I&#39;ll
start liquidating my personal holdings, then I&#39;ll pipe
the money into a Swiss bank account,&quot; he said briskly.

&quot;I&#39;ll start dealing with Nasnami and mine,&quot; Miki said
with a smile then he looked to Nanami, &quot;m&#39;love, you
get to do the negotiating.&quot;

&quot;Why me?&quot; Nanami asked as she watched Miki and Touga&#39;s
fingers fly over each of their respective keyboards.

&quot;Because you&#39;re better than us at it,&quot; Touga shrugged.

Out in the city things were continuing to get bad and
crazy, the AD Police being stretched to the limit
trying to contain the mercenary forces that badly
outnumbered them. All across town the super humans
fought to assist the police, defeating armored
troopers and trying to protect the innocents caught in
the crossfire.

Gree haired tied back in a ponytail Saionji charged,
katana gleaming as he called out, &quot;Rock splitting
sword!&quot; A wave of pure chi energy swept forward, the
mercenary armor practically explodig yet the pilot
within was left unarmed. Dressed in a simple suit of
armor cloth in white and green he looked good, as well
as dangerously capable.

&quot;You know,&quot; Utena ducked a armored fist then she
slashed with the Sword of Dios as she said, &quot;I think
I&#39;m impressed.&quot;

The faceplate of a nearby soldier simply shattered
under the impact of a thrown rose, then Anthy smoothly
brought it down with a swift kick. &quot;Are you all right,
Utena?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Utena smiled. The two women wore stylized
vesions of a boys school uniform, Utena&#39;s in black
edged with rose while Anthy&#39;s was reversed in rose
edged with black. She looked around the battlefield
that had once been a corporastion&#39;s parking lot and
said, &quot;There doesn&#39;t seem to be an end to these
things.&quot;

Saionji nodded seriously as the three set out
together, stepping over fallen armored troopers with
surprising casualness. &quot;We&#39;re making a dent,&quot; he
offered, &quot;but it looks like hundreds of troops were
brought in.&quot;

&quot;And all of them are in power armor,&quot; Anthy added,
casually kicking an armored gauntlet aside. She
reached out to gently squeeze Utena&#39;s hand, unaware of
Saionji&#39;s gaze.

Saionji looked away, focusing instead on keeping a
wary eye on their surroundings. Once upon a time he
had been the one holding Anthy&#39;s hand, if only for a
short time, and he still felt a little twinge when
reminded of it. &#39;Of course I was a jerk back then,&#39; he
reminded himself, &#39;so I doubt the ladies would want to
be reminded.&#39;

&quot;Where do we...&quot; Utena started.

BOOM!

Without a word they raced towards the source of the
explosion, seeing a snake of smoke curling up towards
the sky. Utena lead the way around a corner then they
jerked to a stop, all three of them gazing at what
awaited them in surprise.

A boomer, seemingly gone insane, was wildly tearing at
a mercenary&#39;s power armor, the female type riddled
with bullets but still going strong. Other boomers
were converging on the soldier, then turned to look
curiously at Saionji and the others. Nearby a armor
had exploded, the pilot a bloody mess as more of them
still tore at the wreckage madly.

&quot;This is not good,&quot; Anthy murmured, eyes narrowing
dangerously.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to save the other pilot,&quot; Utena charged
forward, the others following her in.

Saionji shimmered golden a second as he leapt for the
mass of boomers, sword swinging as he called, &quot;Evil
cutting sword, form one!&quot; With a burst of energy
boomers were blasted back, Utena and Anthy swiftly
helping drive the maddened creatures away from the
battered suit.

As te boomers scattered the front of thev armor swung
up, a figure climbing out as smoke billowed out from
within. Coughing madly she stagged away, eyes
streaminng with tears from the smoke and heat within
the wrecked suit. As the three gathered around her she
looked up in disbelief, croaking &quot;Why...?&quot;

Utena offered her a hand, helping her up as she raised
a eyebrow, &quot;Why what?&quot;

&quot;Why are you helping me?&quot; she managed, her blue eyes
almost catlike as dark brown hair fell around her
face. &quot;We&#39;re enemies,&quot; she added a bit hesitantly as
if she really didn&#39;t want to remind them of that fact.

&quot;We don&#39;t kill,&quot; Anthy answered her calmly, &quot;and we
don&#39;t want to see anyone else die if we can help it.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; the young woman looked away, faintly
ashamed.

Saionji had his radio out and called the AD Police,
blinking in surprise at what he heard. &quot;Damn,&quot; he
murmured, &quot;you sure? Understood.&quot;

&quot;More trouble?&quot; Utena asked with a grim smile.

&quot;Boomers all over the city are going mad,&quot; Saionji
said coldly, &quot;and someone hit AD Police headquarters..
there were almost no survivors.&quot;

Both Anthy and Utena turned to look at their captive,
but the young woman liooked almost as appalled. &quot;Can I
use your radio?&quot; she asked, eyes narrowed with pure
anger. She tapped into her command net, her expression
oddly blank as she listened. &quot;It wasn&#39;t our mercs that
did it,&quot; she finally reported, &quot;but Nergal&#39;s private
armed forces.&quot;

&quot;And we should believe you?&quot; Anthy asked coldly.

&quot;We&#39;re mercenaries and we fight for money,&quot; the woman
acknowledged, &quot;but we&#39;re not stupid. Commiting that
sort of crime isn&#39;t profitable, not to mention it&#39;s
the sort of thing that could get us banned or shut
down.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Utena conceded.

The radio sqwaked again and the woman picked it up
again, listening with a look of utter disbelief.
Lowering it she murmured, &quot;A company just bought out
our contracts, we&#39;re being ordered to aid and assist
the AD Police...&quot;

Saionji looked at Anthy and Utena and asked, &quot;Want to
bet Touga and Nanami had something to do with this?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t take sucker bets,&quot; Anthy said deadpan.

The pilot moved to walk off then stopped. &quot;My name is
Yohko,&quot; she said, &quot;Yamamoto Yohko. I owe you my life,
and I intend to repay that debt.&quot;

To be continued...

Note: Yes, that&#39;s Yohko from Starship Girl Yamamoto
Yohko, a series I&#39;ve always liked. I needed a name for
a pilot and it seemed like a not bad fit.</pre>
