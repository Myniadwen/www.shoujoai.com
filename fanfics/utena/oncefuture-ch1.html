<h1>Once and Future...</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Anthy Himemiya took a drink of her cup of tea, the dusky skinned young 
woman putting down the fine cup with a elegant grace. Her purple hair 
fell about her face as she looked up and said, &quot;Arthur...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Tenjou now,&quot; the pink haired woman corrected her from where she 
stood nearby, &quot;I&#39;m Utena Tenjou.&quot;

&#39;So stubborn,&#39; Anthy thought fondly, &#39;as always.&#39; Her glasses gleamed, 
&quot;You may be Utena in this life, but once you were Arthur Pendragon and 
will be once again.&quot;

&quot;I disagree,&quot; Utena shook her head, &quot;Morgan.&quot; She sighed, looking away. 
As soon as she saw Anthy at the door the memories of her past life had 
rushed in, of her childhood in the castle, training with Merlin, drawing 
the sword from the Stone of Destiny, all of it.

Anthy, the reborn incarnation of Morgan LeFay, sighed to herself 
slightly. &quot;Destiny is not optional, Utena.&quot;

&quot;Wanna bet?&quot; Utena shot back defiantly. &quot;And why do you need me, 
anyway?&quot; she demanded fiercely, &quot;The world seems to be carrying on just 
fine without a legendary king from some bygone age.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;d be wrong. The world is in grave danger, Utena&quot; Anthy said to 
her seriously, &quot;from Modred and Merlin.&quot;

&quot;Merlin?&quot; Utena seemed reluctantly interested as she asked, &quot;So what&#39;s 
that old spell pusher up to now?&quot;

&quot;He calls himself Akio now,&quot; Anthy revealed, &quot;and he seeks Excalibur and 
the Stone of Destiny... to put Modred on the throne of the world as 
puppet king.&quot;

&quot;Bastard,&quot; Utena sighed.

&quot;That&#39;d be Modred,&quot; Anthy agreed with a faint smile, &quot;though in this 
life he calls himself Touga Kiryuu.&quot;

&quot;I doubt the world would even notice if Akio did crown a new king,&quot; 
Utena tried to dismiss the growing worry in her gut.

&quot;With the Stone of Destiny and Excalibur Touga would be greater even 
than you were,&quot; Anthy pointed out, &quot;and his charisma would be truly 
unearthly. A great war would result, and then... devastation.&quot;

Reluctantly Utena asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Akio still looks at the world as if it was a thousand years ago,&quot; Anthy 
met Utena&#39;s eyes, &quot;he doesn&#39;t realize the powers in this age. Once Touga 
begins his conquest at least one country will fire their nuclear weapons 
and the world will burn.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t this Touga know to stop him?&quot; Utena asked reluctantly.

&quot;Merlin has so much control over him,&quot; Anthy said to her wryly, &quot;that he 
won&#39;t wipe his ass without instructions.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a mental image I did not need,&quot; Utena cringed.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Anthy didn&#39;t sound terribly apologetic as she set her tea cup 
down, empty. &quot;Will you help?&quot; she asked as she gracefully rose, her long 
red dress flowing around her.

Utena clenched her hand, wishing that she could give some other answer 
but knowing she couldn&#39;t. &quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; she agreed, &quot;but I&#39;ll need a sword.&quot;

&quot;Excalibur is still missing,&quot; Anthy said to her gravely, &quot;but I did 
recover it&#39;s sister blade, Caliburn.&quot;

&quot;Where is it?&quot; Utena asked.

&quot;Here,&quot; Anthy took Utena&#39;s hand and pressed it to her full breasts.

&quot;Wait, I&#39;m not into...&quot; Utena stammered.

A white light exploded from between Utena&#39;s fingers as a sword hilt 
sprung out from between those soft, bouncy breasts. As Anthy fell 
backwards Utena caught her with her other hand as she drew the blade, 
light blazing around them.

&quot;Well done, Utena,&quot; Anthy said. She paused, &quot;You can stand me up, now.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; Utena stood her up, smiling bashfully while still faintly 
stunned at how nice it had been, holding her so close. &quot;Well,&quot; she 
turned the sword over in her hands, checking it&#39;s heft, &quot;what now?&quot;

&quot;Now,&quot; Anthy tidied her dress as they walked to the door of the little 
house outside Tokyo, &quot;we find your knights.&quot;

The fencing tournament was busy, filled with men and women of great 
skill, blades flashing as they fought back and forth. Amid the mass of 
people Utena sheltered Anthy unconsciously as they forced their way 
forward, the sword Caliburn safely hidden within Anthy&#39;s heart once 
more.

&quot;So, who are we looking for?&quot; Utena asked.

&quot;Lancelot,&quot; Anthy answered, &quot;your greatest knight as well as your most 
flawed.&quot;

Utena nodded, looking about as they reached the fencing arena itself. 
There were many fine swordsmen, many capable fighters, but she found her 
gaze falling on a woman who stood over to the side. Her back was stiff, 
expression grave as long orange hair fell in waves down her back. 
Growing impatient she snatched up a foil and entered the battle, swiftly 
defeating her challenger, then another and another.

&quot;Her,&quot; Utena knew it immediately.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Anthy agreed, &quot;Arisugawa Juri.&quot;

&quot;About time you got here,&quot; Juri said, the taller woman looking at both 
of them in annoyance, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;You know...?&quot; Utena blinked.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Juri said, &quot;Anthy came to see me last week.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Utena gave Anthy a look.

Anthy smiled sweetly, &quot;I suspected you&#39;d be the hardest to convince.&quot;

&quot;Or the most thick headed, m&#39;lord,&quot; Juri smiled slightly.

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Utena shook her head, surprised at how easy it was to be 
around this woman. Then again, they HAD known each other in another 
life... &quot;Is there a Guenevere in this life?&quot; she asked wryly.

&quot;I&#39;d rather not talk about it,&quot; Juri sighed as the three left the 
stadium together.

&quot;Her name is Shiori,&quot; Anthy murmured to Utena softly, &quot;and is as much a 
heartbreaker in this life as her last.&quot;

&quot;Yikes,&quot; Utena whispered back.

&quot;I heard that,&quot; Juri said dryly. She looked at Anthy, &quot;Where to next?&quot;

&quot;The perfect knight,&quot; Anthy answered, &quot;Galahad.&quot;

The piano was played with a rare beauty, the notes tinkling like a 
waterfall as the three women entered the college nearby. The blue haired 
boy played like one possessed, his fingers flying across the keys, eyes 
closed in sublime enjoyment of the work.

&quot;Is that,,,?&quot; Utena whispered.

&quot;Miki Kaoru,&quot; Anthy confirmed, &quot;our Galahad.&quot;

He stopped, hands stilling on the keys then he looked up with a warm 
smile. &quot;Juri-sempai,&quot; Miki said happily. His gaze fell on Anthy and 
Utena and he bowed slightly, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re all accepting this rather calmly,&quot; Utena said a bit crossly.

&quot;What choice do we have?&quot; Miki shrugged rather philosophically.

Utena fought the urge to grind her teeth in frustration. &quot;Now,&quot; Anthy 
put a soothing hand on Utena&#39;s arm, &quot;it&#39;s time to see Akio.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we gather the rest of the knights?&quot; Juri looked curious.

&quot;Touga and Akio would expect that,&quot; Utena said, thinking quickly, &quot;but 
if we strike fast we may have an advantage.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Miki nodded.

&quot;Besides, this is a different era,&quot; Anthy added cheerfully as they went 
out of the rehearsal hall. She waved a hand, &quot;Taxi!&quot;

&quot;Bit tight,&quot; Utena squeaked, wedged between Anthy and Juri in the back 
as Miki sat up front with the very amused driver.

&quot;To the Kiryuu corporate headquarters, please,&quot; Anthy said with as much 
dignity as she could muster.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Wakaba grinned then the slightly ditzy girl gunned the battered 
taxi&#39;s engine and they were off like a shot.

&quot;Is that a sword in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?&quot; Juri 
joked, halfway draped over Utena as they rode through town.

&quot;It&#39;s my wallet,&quot; Utena growled.

&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Anthy said, giving Juri a warning look.

The four of them tumbled out of the taxi, gazing up a bit warily at the 
office tower. &quot;Don&#39;t these places have security?&quot; Miki asked with a 
frown.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we have a inside man,&quot; Anthy said as they hurried inside.

Nanami Kiryuu scowled as they entered, the little blonde more than a bit 
cross. &quot;About time you got here, Artie.&quot;

&quot;Sir Kay?&quot; Utena blinked, recognizing the spirit of her adopted brother.

&quot;Later,&quot; Nanami hustled them to the private, executive elevator. 
&quot;Touga&#39;s looking at himself in the mirror again, so we&#39;ve got some time 
to get up there.&quot;

&quot;Bit vain?&quot; Juri smirked.

&quot;He&#39;s just a bit,&quot; Nanami agreed wryly.

&quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot; Utena asked seriously.

&quot;Confront Touga and Akio and stop then,&quot; Anthy shrugged eloquently.

&quot;That&#39;s it?!&quot; Miki squeaked.

&quot;Follow my lead,&quot; Utena sighed, already considering the situation ahead 
of them.

The elevator opened into a opulently decorated office, a massive desk 
over to one side and an entire wall covered by a giant mirror. Touga 
Kiryuu stood there, red hair flowing down his back as he turned 
slightly, &quot;Do you think this uniform makes my butt look big?&quot;

&quot;No, it looks fine,&quot; Akio Ohtori sighed, the dusky skinned young man 
leaning against the desk. His eyes widened as the women spilled out the 
elevator, &quot;You!&quot;

&quot;Hello, big brother,&quot; Anthy smiled.

&quot;Hello, father,&quot; Touga smiled coldly as Utena raced towards him, &quot;this 
time I&#39;ll...&quot;

POW!

In a smooth movement Utena punched him in the face, sending blood flying 
as Touga&#39;s nose broke. &quot;Nice,&quot; Juri admitted.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Miki agreed as they turned to face security forces that 
burst in through the main doors.

&quot;You can&#39;t...&quot; Akio started.

&quot;Don&#39;t even try it,&quot; Anthy blocked him, glasses gleaming as she stared 
him down.

&quot;By nooce,&quot; Touga whimpered, clasping his hands to his face and muffling 
his words.

&quot;I&#39;m only going to explain this once,&quot; Utena yanked him up by his 
collar, &quot;if you don&#39;t give up not only will I keep beating on you, I&#39;ll 
shave you bald.&quot;

Touga&#39;s eyes went wide, &quot;Not the hair!&quot;

&quot;Or I&#39;ll even dye it some ugly color like green,&quot; Utena added.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Saionji, head of the security forces, protested just as Juri was 
kicking his ass.

Touga turned to Akio, &quot;Deals off.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t do this,&quot; Akio blinked.

&quot;I&#39;d give up,&quot; Anthy smirked, &quot;or do you want Utena pissed off at you?&quot;

Akio met Utena&#39;s eyes and gulped, &quot;Good point.&quot;

&quot;So, what are we going to do now?&quot; Miki asked as Saionji lead the 
security forces out, all of them battered by the Juri, Miki, Nanami 
combo.

&quot;World conquest doesn&#39;t interest me,&quot; Utena gave Akio a thoughtful look, 
&quot;but a leader with Excalibur could do some good.&quot; She looked around at 
her companions, &quot;And with the right kind of help, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; Juri spoke up, &quot;I&#39;m rather interested in getting to know you 
better, Utena.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to help, too,&quot; Miki agreed.

&quot;Can I help?&quot; Touga asked, still trying to stop his nose from bleeding.

&quot;Why not,&quot; Utena shrugged.

&quot;Then I&#39;d better stick around to keep him out of trouble,&quot; Nanami 
frowned.

&quot;Where you go, I go,&quot; Anthy took Utena&#39;s arm.

&quot;Could I be of assistance?&quot; Akio offered smoothly.

&quot;NO!&quot;

End.

Notes: Writing Utena/King Arthur is fun, if only as a spoof. The 
connections between characters and Arthurian figures is purely my 
imagination, tho Miki DOES have some of the same purity issues as Sir 
Galahad.</pre>
