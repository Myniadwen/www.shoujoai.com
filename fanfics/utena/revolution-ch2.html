<h1>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Revolution (part 2 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/revolution-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        The former opera hall was buzzing with activity, the people 
rushing about to finish off their tasks before the meetings actually 
began. Moving through the crowds and down the beautifully decorated 
hallways the lady&#39;s ice cold glare split the mob easily, letting her 
quickly reach the handsome young man dressed in blue. Their uniforms 
were similar, designed in the patterns of a bygone era, but unlike 
him, hers was in red.

        &quot;The communications link that you requested has been 
established, sir,&quot; Lady Une said to him respectfully, her round 
glasses catching the light. Her long brown hair was tied back, the 
woman holding herself in stiff control.

        &quot;Thank you Lady,&quot; Treize Khushrenada nodded to her 
respectively, his short brown hair styled back. He had a presence, 
this man, as soon as he entered a room people were drawn to him. With 
a slight smile, &quot;I&#39;ll take it in the study, then.&quot;

        &quot;Of course, sir,&quot; Lady Une bowed her head to him slightly 
before swiftly departing to attend to her other duties.

        A few moments later Treize was sitting down in front of one of 
the viewscreens, among the finery and the scent of old books. A bit of 
snow appeared on the screen before another man&#39;s image appeared. 
&quot;Zechs,&quot; Treize smiled slightly.

        The man in the image looked even more like he had walked right 
out of another era, dressed in dashing red, the helmet he wore 
concealing his eyes. His blond hair went slightly below his square 
shoulders, and his manner was both casual yet very competent. &quot;You 
have my deepest apologies, Treize,&quot; Zechs said, grimacing slightly.

        &quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; Treize reassured him, &quot;I know you had 
those Gundams to deal with.&quot; He frowned, &quot;Do we know why those fools 
attacked Ohtori?&quot;

        &quot;They were clearly ordered to just perform surveillance on the 
school and the dueling forest behind it,&quot; Zechs&#39; hand clenched 
slightly, the rose signet that he wore catching the light, &quot;but 
apparently they decided to show some initiative.&quot;

        Treize leaned backward, frowning as he sorted through his 
thoughts. &quot;Has there been any news on the Rosebride, or of her 
champion?&quot; he finally asked.

        &quot;Nothing,&quot; Zechs answered him with a frown. &quot;There&#39;s been no 
sign of their bodies in the wreckage nor any evidence of their 
presence ever being there.&quot; A soft laugh, &quot;Even their school records 
seem to have disappeared.&quot;

        &quot;We need to find the Rosebride as soon as possible,&quot; Treize 
murmured, &quot;if the rumors are all true, she could be the key to 
everything.&quot;

        &quot;There seems to have been a survivor from the current batch of 
duelists,&quot; Zechs offered that fact up thoughtfully, &quot;if we were to 
keep an close eye on her, it&#39;s quite possible that the Rosebride might 
be drawn to her.&quot;

        &quot;And the Duelist&#39;s name?&quot; Treize asked.

        A slight smile appeared on Zechs face, &quot;Arisugawa Juri.&quot;

        In another part of the world, night was falling on the academy 
as Arisugawa Juri made her way from the school itself to the nearby 
dorms. The buildings, designed in a Victorian style, were different 
from those at Ohtori, and for that she was quite glad.

        The breeze kicked up, her long orange hair blowing from her 
face, and she took a deep breath of the summer air. &#39;It&#39;s been one 
hell of a day,&#39; she thought ruefully, the boy&#39;s school uniform she 
wore standing out among the girl&#39;s uniforms all around her.

        Her duel with Heero Yui still reverberated in Juri&#39;s thoughts. 
He was fast, dangerous, but there was something... badly off inside of 
him. Looking into an opponent&#39;s eyes Juri was used to seeing many 
things, like anger, fear, or excitement. Buy in Heero, she had felt 
nothing, saw no emotion but a cool purpose in his dark eyes.

        &#39;He wanted to hurt me,&#39; Juri mused, &#39;but why?&#39; Somehow she 
knew he didn&#39;t do anything without a reason, and she suspected she 
wasn&#39;t going to like very much. &#39;Hopefully he&#39;s just an opponent,&#39; she 
thought, &#39;and not an enemy.&#39;

        And then there were the consequences of her duel...

        Juri took a cautious look behind her, and noticed that the 
band of adoring young women were still closely following her. The mob 
had begun to form after the duel, and it continued to build as the 
word spread around the school about her victory.

        &#39;I so do not need this right now,&#39; Juri sighed. Her mouth 
twisted into an odd smile, &#39;Not to mention the nickname that I seem to 
have been given.&#39; Almost as soon as she began fencing here she had 
acquired the name &#39;The Prince,&#39; and it seemed to want to stick.

        With a bit of relief she noted that the mob came to a 
disapointed stop once Juri went inside her dorm. There was also a 
certain amount of peeking out of doors going on as she passed by, and 
she sighed softly once she got into her single room and shut the door 
behind her.

        Stepping carefully inside Juri avoided the letters that were 
scattered on the floor, and with a curious look she picked them all 
up. The delicate scent of perfumes wafted up, and with a fierce blush 
she realized they were all love letters.

        &quot;You have got to be kidding me,&quot; Juri muttered softly.

        Only one of the envelopes didn&#39;t bear any obvious scent, and 
Juri hesitantly opened it up. The invitation to Releena&#39;s birthday 
party dropped into her hands, along with a short note: &quot;Thank you for 
your help. I would be honored if you would come.&quot;

        Juri carefully put the invitation aside, setting all the other 
letters on her desk to deal with later. She walked over to the window, 
looking out at the twilight. Reaching into her shirt she pulled out a 
locket, a signet ring dangling from the chain beside it. After a 
moment she clicked it open to reveal the photos that were contained 
inside.

        On one side of the locket was a pretty, purple haired girl, 
smiling out at Juri happily. &quot;Shiori,&quot; she sighed softly. On the other 
side two people stood side by side, one purple haired like Shiori, but 
darker to match her dusky skin. The girl beside her had long, pink 
hair, dressed in a boy&#39;s school uniform. The blue eyes shone with 
happiness, her expression without guile or deceit. &quot;Utena, Anthy,&quot; 
Juri murmured, closing her eyes and remembering the last time she had 
seen them...

        The fires raged all around her, but Juri still knelt, 
struggling with the ceiling support beam. She knew that Shiori was 
dead, knew that no one could have survived that blow to the head, but 
she just couldn&#39;t leave her here alone. A gentle hand came to rest on 
her shoulder, and ignoring all her protests she was pulled to her 
feet.

        Utena took one side, Anthy the other as the dragged the weakly 
struggling Juri out of the burning dorm. They brought her over to a 
hastily set up medical station, and all but ordered them to treat her, 
bandaging the burned hands and cleaning blood from her face.

        Utena was looked back at the building, the light of the fire 
shadowing her face. &quot;I think there&#39;s still students in there,&quot; she 
murmured. She turned to Anthy, &quot;Take care of her, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; 
With that she strode towards the burning buildings. Anthy stood there 
a moment, gazing after her. Then her eyes narrowed, and she moved to 
follow.

        &quot;Stop,&quot; Juri managed to weakly say, &quot;you shouldn&#39;t...&quot;

        Anthy looked back at Juri, and oddly a slight smile appeared 
on her beautiful face. &quot;Where she goes,&quot; she said to her with a 
complete sincerity, &quot;I go.&quot; With that she strode off, soon 
disappearing into the fire after Utena.

        Juri snapped the locket shut, the noise oddly loud in the 
little dorm room. She hadn&#39;t seen either of them again, and no trace 
of them was found searching through the burned rubble. The mobile 
suits who had started the blaze fled too, but not until she was able 
to see the letters painted on the side of one of the suits: OZ.

        When she recovered from her injuries Juri went to the little 
room in the East Dorm. Sneaking inside she took the little photo of 
them, putting it in the locket beside Shiori&#39;s. She would remember 
them and the heroism they showed, always. In her heart she resolved to 
live up to Utena&#39;s example, the best that she could.

        Of course, that was easier said than done.

        Knowing the Specials had been the ones to burn the dorms down 
left her with conflicted feelings. On one hand she wanted to see them 
brought to justice, but the other part... a darker part of her wanted 
revenge, pure and simple. Not that she thought the courts would help, 
considering how quickly they muzzled and report of OZ&#39;s presence 
there, but...

        Juri abandoned that train of thought, sitting down to look 
through the stack of love letters. There were a few from boys, but the 
majority were from young girls. &#39;Wonder if they know anout me,&#39; Juri 
wondered, &#39;or it&#39;s just girlish crushes?&#39;

        The invitation was sitting just apart, and Juri picked it up 
thoughtfully. &#39;Maybe I will go,&#39; she resolved silently.
