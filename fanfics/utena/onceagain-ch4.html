Shinobu Maehara hummed to herself happily as she
worked away in the kitchen of the Hinata Inn, the
scent of chocolate wafting on the air. The black
haired young woman worked away with cheerful
efficiency, finishing up breakfast even as she made up
the chocolate she intended to give away with the meal.

&quot;What&#39;re you doing?&quot; Koalla Su asked curiously, the
dusky skinned blonde looking over her shoulder
curiously.

&quot;Breakfast,&quot; Shinobu smiled at her friend and said,
&quot;and I&#39;m making up some chocolate for everyone, too.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; Su remembered the occasion,
&quot;but with Keitaro gone, it&#39;s going to be kind of
boring.&quot;

Shinobu smiled a little sadly as she said, &quot;It is
going to be different this year, yes.&quot;

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Mutsumi Otohime smiled cheerfully, the
busty graduate student entering the kitchen and
smoothly heading to the fridge. &quot;Shinobu, should I set
the table?&quot; she asked, twin antenna like strands of
hair sticking up sweetly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shinobu beamed, checking the rice then
beginning to fill plates as one by one the residents
came down.

Kitsune yawned as she sat at the table, smiling a bit
sleepily at the others. While no longer a resident,
she often got her meals here and paid for her share of
food. Once a notorious gambler and drinker she had
settled down allot, in part from running the Cafe
Hinata next door. She grinned, &quot;I see that Motoko had
chocolate left at her door again.&quot;

&quot;That happens every year?&quot; Ema asked, the thin young
woman looking curious. She had her laptop open by her
seat, scrolling through documents as she
absentmindedly pursued her hobby of studying the
supernatural.

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Kitsune agreed, &quot;Motoko is popular.&quot;

&quot;Kitsune,&quot; Motoko scolded, the tall black haired young
woman giving her a frown. She carefully set her bird
Shippu on a stand nearby before sitting down, then
looked around worriedly. &quot;Where is that damned
turtle?&quot; she asked coldly.

&quot;Safely in my room,&quot; Mutsumi smiled reassuringly as
she and Shinobu set the plates of food out for
everyone.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy smiled up at Shinobu, her eyes
faintly amused as violet hair fell into her face.
Beside her Kanako nodded her agreement, the rest of
the table repeating similar sentiments. &quot;So what&#39;s
wrong with the turtle?&quot; Anthy asked.

&quot;Motoko has a phobia about &#39;em,&quot; Su explained
cheerfully. &quot;I keep offering to eat her,&quot; she added,
&quot;but nobody will let me,&quot;

&quot;Su!&quot; Shinobu scolded.

&quot;See what I mean?&quot; Su smiled impishly.

Shinobu ignored that, setting out little packets of
chocolate beside everyone&#39;s meal. &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s
day, everyone,&quot; she beamed at them.

&quot;Homemade chocolate from Shinobu?&quot; Kitsune smiled
slightly as she said, &quot;then I know it&#39;s going to be
delicious. Thank you.&quot;

Shinobu blushed charmingly at the compliment. &quot;I
thought we could all exchange chocolate today,&quot; she
explained, &quot;since we don&#39;t have any boys here this
year.&quot;

&quot;What a good idea,&quot; Mutsumi clapped her hands happily.

Kanako frowned just slightly as she briskly said,
&quot;None for me, thanks.&quot; A faint smile, &quot;Considering my
family, I&#39;ve had enough candy to last a life time.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Ema blinked.

&quot;Kanako and Keitaro&#39;s parents ran a candy store,&quot; Su
explained to her calmly, eating away at her meal
happily.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll be hittin&#39; the stores later,&quot; Kitsune
excused herself, &quot;I&#39;m not that good of a cook. But I
do plan on giving everybody chocolate.&quot;

Everyone left not long after, each with jobs to do
today not to mention plans to hand out chocolate to
each other, too. From up in Su&#39;s rooms a loud clanging
was soon heard, then a sudden explosion. Thankfully
that was pretty much normal, so everyone just left
that alone.

&quot;Oh me oh my,&quot; Mutsumi murmured to herself as she
walked to her room, thinking about what to make for
her many friends. Chocolate hearts seemed to be a good
bet, but she didn&#39;t really know about Ema or Anthy&#39;s
tastes just yet. &#39;I could always ask them,&#39; she
thought, detouring to walk towards Anthy&#39;s room.
Moving to open the door she noticed it was open a
crack, and slightly guiltily she peeked it... only to
freeze.

Anthy looked completely different than the casually
dressed girl who had been sitting at the breakfast
table only minutes ago. Instead she wore a lovely gown
in red and white, almost like that a princess might
wear and a simple crown on her brow. She held a single
rose in her hand, her expression oddly sad.

&quot;Power of Dios that sleeps within me,&quot; she murmured
over the rose, &quot;heed your mistress.&quot; As Anthy spoke
the rose shimmered, petals falling free only to thump
softly on the table as pieces of fine chocolate. She
continued until she had enough to give two to each of
the residents, then stopped with a weary sigh.

&#39;The others aren&#39;t going to believe this,&#39; Mutsumi
thought in awe.

Anthy looked down at the red rose as the gown and
ornaments simply faded away, finally murmuring sadly,
&quot;Utena....&quot;

Mutsumi turned away, firmly deciding that it would be
better to ask her later. &#39;Besides,&#39; she thought, &#39;now
I know the name of who she was looking for.&#39;

Meanwhile, Motoko went back to her room, releasing
Shippu to fly freely over the Hinata Inn. She bowed to
the small altar in her room then hesitated in front of
her katana waiting in it&#39;s stand. Part of her wanted
to take up the blade and practice, but she also knew
she was badly distracted.

The chocolates were sitting on her desk, the ones that
Motoko had found that morning waiting for her. No
note, nothing to indicate where they were from, and
home made so she couldn&#39;t identify the store. &#39;Just
like the last year,&#39; Motoko mused as she took a piece
of chocolate, savoring it as it melted in her mouth.

There was a soft knock then Kanako called out, &quot;Can I
come in?&quot;

&#39;At least I know it wasn&#39;t her, she wasn&#39;t here last
year,&#39; Motoko thought. &quot;Come in,&quot; she answered
stiffly.

Kanako moved gracefully, almost like the cat she
usually carried, and she was dressed in her usual dark
colors. &quot;Good morning,&quot; she said softly, &quot;how are
you?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Motoko said flatly. She still didn&#39;t much like
Kanako for what she had pulled back when she first
arrived at the Hinata Inn, and she was determined not
to change her mind. Oddly, over the past few months
the woman had seemed almost saint-like by comparison,
running the dorm with smooth efficiency, but that
didn&#39;t change anything.

&quot;I was thinking of bringing you something,&quot; Kanako
softly admitted, surprising Motoko a little, &quot;but I
couldn&#39;t figure out what you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;But why?&quot; Motoko blinked, feeling faintly surprised.
The idea of Kanako giving Valentine&#39;s chocolate out
was shocking, especially considering her usually dour
personality.

Kanako made a face, &quot;I&#39;ve been considering what you
said, Motoko. I&#39;m beginning to think you might have a
point.&quot;

&quot;And what did you intend to do about it?&quot; Motoko
sounded decidedly wary. Considering that Kanako had
nearly ravished her disguised as Naru, it was just a
little worrisome.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Kanako smiled faintly, &quot;I don&#39;t have
dishonorable designs on you.&quot; She looked almost
amused, &quot;I just wanted to thank you for your help, I
suppose.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; common courtesy made Motoko answer.
Before the conversation could limp forward some more a
knock sounded on the door, &quot;Come in.&quot;

Whoosh!

A small, turtle designed robot soared in, making both
women jump. From it&#39;s belly chocolate dropped out,
floating to the top of Motoko&#39;s desk via a little
parachute, then it swept out in a burst of
jet-propelled power.

&quot;Su?&quot; Kanako asked as Motoko looked at the card
attached to the candy.

&quot;Su,&quot; Motoko agreed wryly.</pre>
