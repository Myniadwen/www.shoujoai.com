<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 1 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;Wow, Anthy, look at all these new people!&#148; Utena exclaimed in 
surprise, as they tried to move through the massive crowd. Before 
Anthy could reply, they were interrupted by a bare chested, handsome 
young man running by!

&#147;Princess!&#148; Carrot Glace shouted desperately, his legs pumping madly, 
&#147;Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! 
Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess!&#148;

Tira Misu, chasing him at full speed cried, &#147;It&#146;s time to take you&#146;re 
whipping of love! Call me Queen!&#148; and continued to chase him with the 
whip. Three other rather oddly dressed figures followed behind them 
looking very embarrassed.

Utena and Anthy watched as they disappeared into the crowd, 
sweatdropping. Shaking their heads they continued heading towards the 
school. Up ahead, they noticed Miki in discussion with another young 
man and several women.

&#147; Actually, Miki,&#148; the young man was saying, &#147;I&#146;m president of the 
newly formed Ohtori motor club, so you joining would be easy! I&#146;m 
Keiichi Morisato,&#148; he introduced himself, &#147;and this is my sister 
Megumi. These are some of the club members,&#148; he says, gesturing to 
several ladies, &#147;our former president, and that&#146;s Belldandy.&#148; Megumi, 
Sora, Shuld and Chihiro waved cheerfully, giving Miki a very thorough 
visual going over, and liking what they saw. He sweatdropped as well, 
and fled.

Mara watched the goings on, perched high up in a tree branch. She was 
feeling very amused. &#147;Oh, Keichii, you have no idea what kind of 
trouble you are in.&#148; she murmured softly. Suddenly, she looses her 
balance on the tree limb and plummets to the ground. Before she can 
pick herself up, a woman steps from behind the tree, grabs her hand 
and pulls her up. &#147;Urd?!&#148; Mara gasps softly.

Urd smiles at her slowly. &#147;Long time no see, Mara.&#148; she said in sultry 
tones, and leans in for a kiss.

In the distance, Utena began to hear a low rumbling, and shouts, 
growing quickly closer and louder. Turning back, she saw a dust cloud, 
and figures clearing the way for a rapidly moving object. Grabbing 
Anthy, Utena gracefully dived to the side, even as it reached them. 
The tall redheaded girl ran past them at an incredible speed, tearing 
up the cobblestones, even as the blond haired girl she was pulling 
waved cheerfully at them. In a few seconds, they were gone. &#147;Wow,&#148; 
Utena heard, and turned to see a tall, blue-haired girl watching with 
amusement &#147;is A-ko going to be angry when she realizes she&#146;s early for 
school. Oh well.&#148; B-Ko shrugged, and moved off to follow A-Ko and 
C-ko.

Two sandy haired young women were looking one another over, as a 
third, dark haired woman looks on in astonishment. Except for the face 
paint on one, they looked remarkably similar. &#147;Think we&#146;re related?&#148; 
Lufy asked, frowning.

Priss Asagiri shrugged, looking doubtful. &#147;Anything&#146;s possible, I 
guess.&#148; she answered. Sylia Stingray sweatdropped, then just slowly 
shook her head.

&#147;Utena-sama!&#148; Utena heard from behind her, in what sounded like 
Wakaba&#146;s oh so familiar bezerkly kawaii tones and she was glomped! 
Staggering a moment, she realized by the weight that it couldn&#146;t be 
Wakaba on her back. &#147;Your right, Wakaba, that was fun!&#148; the cheerful 
girl said as she slid down from Utena&#146;s back, and Utena turned to see 
a skinny, blond haired girl with her hair up in what looked like a 
pair of meatballs! She grinned happily and extended her hand, saying 
&#147;I&#146;m Usagi, nice to meet you!&#148;

&#147;Hello, Usagi&#148; Utena said, liking the girl&#146;s innocent air, &#147;I see 
Wakaba has told you about me, and this is my friend Himimiya Anthy.&#148; 
Usagi turned back to the crowd, and began waving.

Responding to Usagi&#146;s waves, a small group of women came over, and 
Usagi introduced Rei, Minako, Ami, Makoto, Chibi-Usa and Hotaru. Usagi 
looked around, and then seemed to see who she was looking for. Usagi 
also pointed out two young women taking to Juri, and explained they 
were her friends Haruka and Michiru.



In the classroom...

The teacher took one look at the massive group of new students 
standing there and simply asked them to take any available seats and 
introduce themselves to their classmates. &#147;They look nice enough,&#148; 
Utena thought, and tried to concentrate on her schoolwork. From the 
corner of her eye, she saw something...odd with one of the students 
nearby. A beautiful young woman leaned over the cute girl, the woman&#146;s 
catgirl costume clinging to every curve, as she kissed the girl&#146;s 
cheek. A graceful hand lifted the hair from the back of the girl&#146;s 
neck so the catgirl could nibble at it teasingly.

The cute girl noticed that Utena was staring at her and smiled weakly. 
&#147;H.. H.. Hi.&#148; she gasped out as the catgirl reached around her. &#147;I&#146;m 
Miyuki-chan.&#148; the flushed girl said quietly. &#147;Don&#146;t worry,&#148; she said, 
as she was slapping at the very aggressive catgirl&#146;s groping hands, 
who only smiled at her seductively, &#147;they&#146;re just figments of my 
imagination.&#148;

&#147;They?&#148; Utena echoed quietly,and looked around. In the back of the 
room, a group of girls in rabbit, church mouse, field mouse outfits, 
and top hat and tails were drinking tea with Nanami&#146;s cronies while a 
tall woman with a spiked, leather costume was looking over Wakaba like 
she wanted to eat her up. Wakaba didn&#146;t look like she&#146;d mind, either. 
Utena sweatdropped and tried to go back to work.

&#147;Ayeka!&#148; Utena heard in whining tones from the other side of the 
classroom, &#147;I&#146;m bored!&#148; A contrary looking young woman with long, grey 
blue hair was floating in mid-air, crosslegged, beside the chair of a 
girl with equally long purple hair.

&#147;Ryouko! I&#146;m trying to concentrate! Anyways, I&#146;m sure that lowly space 
pirate trash like yourself couldn&#146;t possibly apreciate the subtlety of 
this class anyway.&#148; Ayeka answered her in haughty tones.

Actually, it&#146;s pretty boring, a smiling Utena thought, as she 
continued to watch them argue along with most of the class. This was 
way more entertaining than the last few kendo tournaments had been.

&#147;Well excuse me princess! I didn&#146;t ask to be dragged along with you on 
this little excursion, because you couldn&#146;t find a willing man to go 
with you!&#148; Ryouko snapped back in waspish tones.

&#147;I don&#146;t have to take that! Not from someone like you!&#148; Ayeka said, 
standing with fists clenched as she glared at Ryouko, lightning arcing 
around her.

&#147;Oh no? Go ahead and try to stop me, if you can, princess.&#148; Ryouko 
answered in throaty tones, as a sinister red glow formed around her 
hands. Ayeka jumped her, and in moments the two young women were 
rolling on the floor, scrapping. Desks and chairs were knocked aside 
as the ocassional energy bolt went flying around the room. Suddenly, 
the whole tone of the battle seemed to change as the two seperated for 
a moment.

Ayeka&#146;s robe was pulled askew, bearing one shoulder, and Ryouko&#146;s top 
was partially torn open. They both struggled to regain their breaths 
as they gazed at each other with a frightening intensely. Ryouko 
suddenly grasped Ayeka&#146;s shoulders and pulled her into a kiss, to the 
cheers of the surrounding students.

Noticing that they have an audience, Ryouko pulls Ayeka closer, and 
teleports them both away. The teacher stands dazed, swaying back and 
forth at the front of the class, his hair and clothing smoking 
slightly from a stray energy bolt.

&#147;Class dismissed.&#148; he says, blinks a few times and promptly topples 
over.

A new club at Ohtori...

A large, brightly colored banner was clearly visible over the new 
club&#146;s expertly designed booth. It read &#147;Ohtori Yuri and Yaoi Club&#148;, 
and was, not surprisingly for Ohtori, surrounded by a massive crowd. 
Asirugawa Juri and her secretary, Takatsuki Shiori, were frankly 
beginning to look more than a bit stressed as they tried to sign up 
the mob.

Heero Yui, Duo Maxwell, Trowa Barton and Quatre Rebaba Winner all 
happily took their membership cards, and the next pair moved up. 
&#147;Hiii!&#148; Mihoshi said in her extremely kawaii tones as she dragged a 
kicking and screaming Kiyone behind her.

&#147;Aren&#146;t you two on the teaching staff?&#148; Juri asked with a eyebrow 
raised, as she was much too cool to actually sweatdrop. Mihoshi 
suddenly looks like she&#146;ll start crying. &#147;Not that that&#146;s a problem,&#148; 
Juri says quickly, and she and Shiori rapidly hand each of them their 
membership cards. She didn&#146;t want a repeat of the &#147;Usagi&#148; incident.

The crowd parted as two beautiful, almost regal seeming young women 
make their way through the crowd. &#147;We&#146;d like to sign up,&#148; Dorothy 
Catalonia said, Releena Peacecraft at her side. Heero Yui turned back 
from walking away, and for just a moment, something like pain flashes 
in his eyes.

Duo Maxwell pulls at his arm, pouting kawaiily. &#147;Come on Heero, don&#146;t 
waste time, it&#146;s your turn to be the love-monkey tonight!&#148; Dead 
silence. Almost everybody sweatdrops and Heero blushes, as the two 
leave, quickly.

A quiet and cold voice cut through the nearly out of control crowd&#146;s 
increasing volume: &#147;What, exactly, is going on here?&#148; Major Motoko 
Kusanagi in her skintight, pseudo-military uniform scanned the large 
crowd, assesing the situation.

Juri looked at her with a slightly awed expression, large hearts in 
her eyes. &#147;Sorry, we&#146;re just doing our club sign-up, and we got a much 
larger response than we expected.&#148; Juri said apologeticly.

The Major smiled slightly. &#147;It&#146;s certaily understandable. I&#146;m sure any 
club with you as a member would be swamped.&#148; she said charmingly. She 
turned back to the crowd and yelled, &#147;Hey, you, and you beside him!&#148; 
Toya and Yuki walk over, smiling and carrying their newly issued 
membership cards. &#147;You&#146;re now part of the official crowd control. Lets 
try to get everybody lined up and keep them there.&#148; She and the two 
young men start to move off, then she stops. &#147;Oh, and please sign me 
up, too.&#148;

Juri sighs happily and Shiori glares jealously. As the Major leans 
over the table to take her card, she softly says to Shiori &#147;I do 
threesomes too.&#148; Leaving the fiercely blushing girls behind, she moves 
off to help Toya and Yuki.

After they finished signing up Urd and Mara, Rally Vincent and Misty 
Brown, and Sakura and Tomoyo, Shiori very happily said, &#147;Whew, our 
relief&#146;s here,&#148; as she saw Haruka and Michiru walking up. Just as they 
took the seats, Miyuki-chan turned up, with all the figments of her 
imagination close behind.

&#147;OK,&#148; Haruka said, running through the checklist &#147;cards for: the Mad 
Hatter, Cheshire Cat, Red Queen, Field Mouse, Church Mouse, March 
Hare, Miss Door, and, of course, Miyuki-chan.&#148; Michiru calmly handed 
the cards out, fending off the Red Queen&#146;s advances quite handily 
while doing so.

A very cute blond haired girl made her way up the line, looking for 
someone. &#147;A-ko-chan!&#148; C-ko finally yelled, loudly. Suddenly, the red 
head plummeted from the sky, pursued by a blue haired girl in battle 
armor. &#147;We&#146;d like to sign up.&#148; C-ko said in her normally happy tones.

Haruka and Michiru sweatdrop....



A Relaxing Drive...

Akio relaxed, leaning back in the drivers seat and smiled happily as 
he cruised away from Ohtori Academy. &#147;Nothing like a long drive to 
clear the mind of any troubles,&#148; he thought. As he reached the edge of 
the school grounds, he suddenly slammed to a stop and stared, 
disbelievingly. There was a roadblock, manned by two very luscious 
blondes,and a darker haired woman! All three were in pseudo-military 
costumes and perched on what looked like a mini tank!

His good mood having suddenly evaporated, Akio roughly rolled his 
window down and stuck his head out. &#147;What do you think you&#146;re doing?!&#148; 
he shouted angrily at them.

The dark haired woman gestured to one of the tall blondes, who climbed 
up on and then into the tank, morphing into a SD version of herself. 
The brown haired girl then turned to Akio with a pleasant smile on her 
face. &#147;Hi there! My name is Leona Qzaki, and I&#146;m one of the new truant 
officers for Ohtori academy! When someone&#148; (cut to the image of a 
smiling Touga) &#147;mentioned a student regularly leaving classes to drive 
around the area, I thought it would be a good start to my new duties 
here. Now, return to school, or suffer the consequences.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t you know who...&#148; Akio started, when suddenly , BOOM, a tank 
shell whizzed through his windshield and right by his head! He turned, 
very, very slowly, and surveyed the damage to his beautiful car, a 
massive sweatdrop on his head.

&#147;Boss, can I shoot him now? Please?&#148; a voice from within the tank 
asked eagerly.

&#147;No, Anna.&#148; Leona shouted down into the tank. &#147;First, we see if the 
warning shot actually worked. Then, you can shoot him.&#148; Leona looked 
up and smiled sweetly at Akio.

In a moment, Akio had quickly reversed the car, and sped back to the 
academy. He didn&#146;t know what was going on, but he was going to find 
out. </pre>
