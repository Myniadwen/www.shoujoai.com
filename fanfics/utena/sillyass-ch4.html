<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 4 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Wakaba sat on one of the benches in the rose garden and tried hard to 
study for the upcoming math test. It wasn&#146;t easy, considering the mob 
of crazy people that had descended on the school. &#145;I hope someone 
figures out where all these people came from.&#146; she thought. &#145;And how 
to send them home.&#146;

&#147;Excuse me?&#148; a sweetly kawaii voice asked Wakaba from behind her. She 
quickly turned in her seat to see who it was and just froze. The young 
woman was tall, with long brown hair. She was also very shapely, 
something that was obvious from the skintight black leather sheath she 
was wearing that hugged her from her long legs to her dainty neck. She 
was also carrying a fairly fearsome looking leather whip.

&#147;Have you seen The Cheshire Cat, Miss Bunny, the Red Queen, or Miss 
Door?&#148; the young woman asked. Wakaba looked at the girl a moment, 
sweatdropping, and shook her head, no. Miyuki-chan pouted kawaiily. 
&#147;Ever since I started hanging out with Tira Misu, they won&#146;t play with 
me anymore!&#148;

She sat by Wakaba on the bench, stretching out her legs and rolling up 
her whip beside her on the seat. &#147;I&#146;m Miyuki-chan. What&#146;s you&#146;re 
name?&#148; she asked seductively, sliding close to Wakaba, and running a 
leather clad hand up her neck.

&#147;Shinohara Wakaba,&#148; she stuttered, as Miyuki-chan leaned closer to 
her. Wakaba saw a red leather clad woman furtively moving through the 
crowd. &#147;Look,&#148; she cried, &#147;isn&#146;t that the Red Queen?&#148; Wakaba pointed 
into the crowd.

Miyuki-chan was up in a shot and off into the crowd. She shot a 
parting smile for Wakaba over her shoulder. Wakaba wearily slumped 
down on the bench and sighed with relief. &#147;Thank god she&#146;s gone,&#148; 
Wakaba said softly.

Suddenly, the Red Queen, a girl in a bunny suit, another girl in a cat 
suit, and one girl that seemed to be half human, half door, all 
charged at Wakaba. They plucked her up from the seat and kept on 
running, carrying her on their shoulders. From behing, Wakaba could 
here Miyuki-chan yelling &#147;Stand still for your whipping of love!&#148;

In another part of the garden, Utena sighed happily. &#145;Finally, I get 
to relax,&#146; she thought, and sat down on the sun drenched hill with her 
bento box for lunch. She opens it and begins to eat eagerly. Suddenly, 
she noticed a disturbance, moving through the crowd.

A group suddenly broke out of the mob and sprinted across the grass. 
Wakaba was yelling loudly at the top of her lungs as she was being 
carried on the shoulders of four very, very oddly dressed women. 
&#147;Whaa!&#148; Wakaba cried, &#147;Let me down! Help!&#148; Another woman, in leather, 
was right behind them, cracking a whip!

Utena watched dumbfounded, sweatdropping. &#147;Why me?&#148; she groaned 
softly, quickly scarfed down what was left of her lunch, and took off 
in hot persuit. &#147;Why does this stuff always happen to me?&#148;

Just Communication...

Treise Khushrenada looked around the totally quiet command center with 
an irritated expression on his handsome face. A soft beeping 
interrupted his thoughts.

&#147;Mr. Treise,&#148; Lady Une&#146;s soft voice came over the communication 
system. &#147;You have a call from... him.&#148;

The screen lit up and Miliardo Peacecraft&#146;s face appeared on the 
screen. &#147;You can&#146;t find them either?&#148; he asked.

&#147;No,&#148; Treise said glumly. &#147;The gundams, Releena, Dorothy and Noin are 
all missing, after checking out that remote region in Japan.&#148;

Miliardo grimaces. &#147;The White Fang figures they&#146;ve gone to ground, and 
are readying a devastating assault on them.&#148;

Treise snorted, then nodded agreement. &#147;The Earth forces are getting 
jumpier and jumpier, waiting for the inevitable attack.&#148;

Miliardo nodded firmly. &#147;Lets go there ourselves,&#148; he suggested, &#147;and 
find out what happened to them.&#148; Treise looked at him a moment, then 
reluctantly nodded.

A nearby voice told Treise &#147;I&#146;m coming too.&#148; Lady Une walked in, 
flightsuit ready.

&#147;Mr. Treise, your Tallgeese II is ready to go. I&#146;ve also prepared the 
Wing Gundam for myself.&#148;

She looks with destain at the former Zechs Merquise. &#147;I&#146;m sure the 
Epyon is fueled and ready for launch?&#148;

&#147;Miliardo Peacecraft can&#146;t officially go,&#148; Miliardo said with a grin, 
&#147;but Zechs Merquise will meet you above Japan.&#148; Treise laughed softly, 
nodding.



A few hours later, Treise was smiling as he met the Epyon in low 
orbit. The Tallgeese II and Lady Une in the Wing Gundam hovered beside 
it, then together they descended. Down, diving through layers of 
clouds and over rough terrain, until the Ohtori region appeared on the 
horizon. Treise frowned, seeing a figure in the distance. He magnified 
the image, then asked &#147;Zechs, Une, is that the Wing Zero over there?&#148;

&#147;Looks like it.&#148; Zechs said calmly.

&#147;I&#146;m attempting communications, but nothings getting through,&#148; Lady 
Une reported. They soared nearer, and noticed the gundam frantically 
signaling with it&#146;s arms.

&#147;He probably needs help,&#148; Treise said smugly. They went down, and the 
gundam&#146;s arms signaled harder. Suddenly, they hit massive turbulence, 
and the radio suddenly kicked in.

&#147;You idiots! Stay away, stay back... oh damn. Too late.&#148; Heero said, 
as his face appeared on their video screens. &#147;Try to leave, quickly! 
Go back the way you came!&#148; Heero asked. Zechs turned his gundam and 
drove back, only to hit a invisible barrier. He backed up and tried 
again, coming to another dead stop.

&#147;You can get in, but you can&#146;t get out,&#148; Zechs said softly. Then he 
began to swear. The three brought their mobile suits down by Wing 
Zero.

&#147;Who&#146;s in charge here?&#148; Treise asked Heero a few moments later, 
standing with Une and Zechs at the feet of his mobile suit.

&#147;I&#146;d guess Akio Ohtori,&#148; Heero said thoughtfully. &#147;Last time I 
checked, he was over that way.&#148; Treise, Zechs and Lady Une set off. 
The campus was jammed with people, of all shapes and sizes. As they 
moved deeper, they noticed more and more damaged buildings, until they 
came to a fallen robot, and a handsome young man staring at it 
mournfully.

&#147;Good day, sir,&#148; Lady Une said cautiously. &#147;Are you Akio Ohtori?&#148; she 
asked.

&#147;Yes, I am,&#148; Akio said simply. He looked Treise and Zechs over 
thoughtfully, then smiled broadly. &#147;I have a very important question 
for you!&#148;

Both Zechs and Treise blinked a bit with surprise. &#147;What question?&#148; 
Zechs asked him cautiously.

&#147;Do you like Cognac?&#148; Both Zechs and Treise stammered out 
affirmatives. &#147;Good, lets go get drunk,&#148; Akio said simply, putting an 
arm over each of their shoulders. Ignoring their protests, he led them 
away.

Lady Une sweatdropped, and shook her head. A short, but determined 
search later, and she was directed to the Campus Security office and 
Lt. Noin. &#147;Lt., report!&#148; Une barked, entering. Noin gave her an 
amused, steady glance.

&#147;Aren&#146;t you a bit out of your jurisdiction?&#148; Noin asked with a sweet 
smile. She stretched, catlike, and smoothly got out of her chair to 
guide Une to a seat. &#147;How are you, Lady?&#148; Noin asked charmingly.

&#147;Ah, fine,&#148; Une answered, surprised. &#147;What&#146;s going on here, anyway?&#148; 
she asked plaintively. Noin laughed softly. She sat by Une, stretching 
her legs out, letting Une see her gracefulness.

&#147;This place is a mix of many separate worlds, or realities. Quatre 
gave me a long winded explanation that gave me a headache, but until 
they&#146;re separated, we can&#146;t leave.&#148; Noin smiled comfortingly at Une, 
putting her hand on hers and patting it softly. &#147;It&#146;s a nice place, 
though, even if it&#146;s a bit crazy.&#148;

Lady Une blushed, looking over at Noin. Noin smiled warmly, and 
brought her chair nearer Une&#146;s. &#147;Have I ever told you how lovely you 
are?&#148; Noin asked.

&#147;No...&#148; Une whispered. Noin leaned over, and ever so gently kissed 
Une. &#147;Where did that come from?&#148; Une asked, sounding not at all 
displeased.

Noin kissed her again, gently. &#147;I was your subordinate,&#148; Noin 
whispered, &#147;it wouldn&#146;t have been appropriate. But that didn&#146;t stop me 
from thinking about it.&#148;

&#147;What about Zechs?&#148; Une managed to gasp, as Noin began nibbling Une&#146;s 
neck.

She leaned back a moment, smiling broadly. &#147;We&#146;re each others 
protection. He lets me chase after my girls, while he persues his 
boys,&#148; she laughed. Une smiled back, and Noin drew her into another 
kiss.



The Crossdimensional Adventures of...

On Gaea: Vaun watched in awe as the wind whipped around Hitomi, her 
school girl&#146;s uniform rustling, and white, shining wings unfurled from 
her back. They stretched out to either side, there was a bright light, 
and she was gone.

In a burst of light, feathers scattering in the breeze, Hitomi 
suddenly appeared in the middle of the sidewalk. She looked around 
dazedly, trying to see where she was, when she suddenly heard voices 
yelling, one especially loudly.

&#147;Help! Put me down! Watch the hands! Whaah!&#148; Wakaba hollered, still 
being carried along by the Red Queen, Ms. Door, the Cheshire Cat, and 
a few others. Seeing them racing right at her, Hitomi executed a 
graceful swan dive out of the way. Right behind them a really cute 
girl in leather and waving a whip ran by chasing them. Hitomi watched 
them go by, wide eyed.

As they ran into the distance, Hitomi could faintly here the cute girl 
yelling &#147;Stay still for your whipping of love!&#148; She sighed and shook 
her head wearily.

&#147;What kind of crazy place is this?&#148; Hitomi asked herself. Another, out 
of breath figure staggered out of the crowd. Hitomi grabbed the pink 
haired girl and asked &#147;Where am I?&#148;

Utena wheezed a bit, trying to get her breath back. &#147;Your... at... 
Ohtori... Academy.&#148; Utena gasped out. Hitomi frowned and let her go, 
watching her stagger off after the others.

&#147;Now what do I do?&#148; Hitomi asked herself quietly.

&#147;You all right?&#148; a voice asked from behind her. She turned her head to 
see a young woman with wavy short blue hair. Kozue smiled at her, and 
repeated softly &#147;Are you all right?&#148; a bit slower.

&#147;Sorry,&#148; Hitomi said, blushing. &#147;I&#146;m just confused.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s OK. Let me guess, you were originally on another world, you&#146;ve 
mysteriously appeared here in this one, and you have no idea what&#146;s 
going on, right?&#148; Kozue said with a cheery smile. Hitomi just nodded 
at her, shocked. &#147;Join the club, almost everybody here has that 
problem.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148; Hitomi asked, surprised.

&#147;Yeah, in one day we tripled our population, at least. Nobody knows 
how it happened, or at least nobody&#146;s saying anything if they do 
know,&#148; Kozue said with a shrug. &#147;Come on, I think there&#146;s still one or 
two rooms left in the East Dorm.&#148; She lead Hitomi off, answering 
questions and cheerfully talking as they went.



Hitomi stared at her wide eyed. &#147;You&#146;re telling me the robot dropped 
it&#146;s pants and fired off a rocket from it&#146;s...&#148;

&#147;Uh huh.&#148; Kozue said with a nod. &#147;That Gaea sounds incredible, though. 
That Alan sounds like a hottie!&#148;

Hitomi blushed brightly. &#147;I more had eyes for Vaun,&#148; she admitted 
softly, looking over at the smiling girl.

&#147;You like the troubled guys who have issues, huh?&#148; Kozue said with a 
grin. &#147;Remind me to introduce you to my brother, Miki. He&#146;s 
practically filled with issues.&#148;

Hitomi looked at her, surprised. &#147;Thank you, I think.&#148;

When they reached the dorm, Kozue cautiously walked up the steps and 
carefully opened the main door. &#147;What did you do that for?&#148; Hitomi 
asked. Suddenly, a small golden brown creature zipped by around nose 
level.

&#147;Coming through!&#148; Keroberos yelled. Hitomi watched it fly off, 
sweatdropping.

&#147;That&#146;s why,&#148; Kozue said with a grin. &#147;Follow me, carefully,&#148; she 
urged. They began to make their way into the older building. The 
hallways were packed, filled with young women and one or two young 
men. Some were in school uniforms, but most were in outrageous outfits 
of one type or another.

&#147;Is it me,&#148; Hitomi said slowly, &#147;or is there a lot more girls than 
boys around here?&#148; Hitomi gawked as Rei and Asuka walked by in their 
skintight Eva uniforms.

&#147;We had that problem before the population explosion,&#148; Kozue admitted. 
&#147;But it&#146;s been much worse since then. Thankfully, lots of the 
newcomers are lesbians.&#148;

Hitomi sweatdropped, again. &#147;Really?&#148; she squeaked out.

&#147;Yeah, you should meet Sailor Moon and her harem,&#148; Kozue said smiling.

Hitomi just shook her head. They went back to looking for a empty 
room, when Hitomi spotted one. &#147;This one&#146;s empty!&#148;

&#147;Not a good idea,&#148; Kozue said, shaking her head.

&#147;Why not?&#148; Hitomi asked, frowning.

Kozue points to the nametag on the next room:Haruka and Michiru. &#147;I 
understand Michiru&#146;s a screamer.&#148;

It took Hitomi a moment to get that, then she blushed brightly. </pre>
