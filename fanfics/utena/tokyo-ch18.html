<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 18 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>        &quot;Lets head inside,&quot; Ayaka said, her long red hair flowing over 
her shoulders, &quot;there&#39;s someone waiting inside who you really should 
see.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Utena looked down at the body of Saya, just a bit 
startled to see it beginning to dissolve. &#39;She really was different than 
us,&#39; the pink haired girl mused. She walked over to where she had flung 
the sword&#39;s hilt, then slid the weapon home with a rasp, carrying it at 
her side.

        The bouncer&#39;s black hair fell into her eyes, her long leather 
coat flowing around her. She tilted her head to the side, &quot;Most of the 
staff&#39;s going to be leaving, you want me to stick around?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s not a good idea, Bones,&quot; Ayaka smiled at the bouncer, 
&quot;you&#39;re tough, but I don&#39;t know if you can take vampires.&quot;

        Utena nodded, &quot;But thanks for the offer.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Bones pushed off from her spot by the door, only 
pausing to look over at Juri thoughtfully. Then she slipped away into 
the darkness.

        &quot;That was odd,&quot; Juri noted, her long orange hair falling past 
her shoulders.

        &quot;Maybe she likes you,&quot; Shiori added with a slight smile, her 
purple hair elegantly messy.

        &quot;Are we going inside,&quot; Integra asked coldly, her eyes flashing 
behind her glasses, &quot;or not?&quot;

        The band of vampire slayers moved down the hallway, stepping out 
into a larger room. There were two women waiting behind the bar, several 
tables had been pushed together and covered with snacks, but otherwise 
the place seemed deserted.

        A woman strode out of the shadows, a slight smile on her 
handsome face. &quot;I had most of the staff stay home tonight,&quot; the 
completely human incarnation of Arisugawa Juri said simply, &quot;but I had 
to stick around to meet you.&quot;

        &quot;How...&quot; Juri blinked, the vampiress&#39; eyes wide with surprise.

        &quot;Long story,&quot; Juri shrugged. She looked over at Utena, &quot;Minagi 
and Ryouko insisted on staying to tend bar, but they&#39;ve been instructed 
to stay out of any fights. Also, if you&#39;re going to fight please try to 
take it outside.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, right,&quot; Utena managed, her thoughts racing. &#39;Does this mean 
there&#39;s a human version of me around, too?&#39; she wondered.

        &quot;I&#39;ll be back later this evening,&quot; Juri looked at Ayaka 
pointedly, &quot;and I expect to find the place roughly the way I left it.&quot;

        &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Ayaka threw a mock salute, Juri walking out 
grumbling softly.

        &quot;Is that who you wanted me to meet?&quot; Utena asked softly.

        &quot;No,&quot; Ayaka shook her head slightly before nodding towards a 
dark corner of the club, &quot;she&#39;s sitting over there.&quot;

        Utena turned, her eyes piercing the darkness. The woman in the 
traditional kimono drank from a crystal glass, a young human woman 
sitting beside her. Utena felt her eyes widening as she softly murmured, 
&quot;Miyu.&quot;

        &quot;Do you want me to go with you?&quot; Juri asked Utena quietly, the 
taller vampire&#39;s eyes narrowing as she studied the figures in the 
corner.

        &quot;I&#39;d appreciate it,&quot; Utena said as the two walked forward 
together.

        Integra watched Utena and Juri move off together, then the gray 
haired woman turned her attention back to Anthy. &quot;Do you want to get a 
drink?&quot; she asked calmly.

        &quot;Please,&quot; Anthy smiled slightly. Utena&#39;s girls had just finished 
ordering their drinks, Ami, Excel and Hitomi getting odd looks from the 
two cyan haired bartenders. &quot;Someone you know?&quot; Anthy asked the nearest 
one, noting the scars on her cheeks.

        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Minagi agreed. She gave the three a grin 
before asking, &quot;So what can I get you folks?&quot;

        &quot;Whisky,&quot; Integra said simply.

        &quot;Blood and rum,&quot; Ceres said, the blonde soldier looking around 
her warily.

        &quot;Blood and wine,&quot; Anthy ordered.

        &quot;Got it,&quot; the unscarred twin helped pour the drinks. Ryouko 
moved stylishly behind the bar, a impish grin on her face and her 
catlike blue eyes shining with excitement. &quot;May I just say how odd this 
is?&quot; she noted as she passed the drinks around.

        &quot;We all have twins you know, I take it?&quot; Integra asked softly.

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryouko agreed, &quot;though you and Ceres aren&#39;t all that 
different.&quot; She dropped her voice, &quot;But Anthy, Juri and Utena? Wow.&quot;

        Integra looked over at where Juri and Utena were talking to a 
strange young woman. &quot;They aren&#39;t quite what I was expecting,&quot; she 
admitted.

        Utena settled into the seat across from Miyu, studying the pale 
vampire child thoughtfully. She still shone with power, but somehow it 
was a bit less overwhelming than it had been on their first meeting. 
&quot;You wanted to see me?&quot; Utena asked.

        Miyu smiled slightly, drinking something red from a wine glass. 
&quot;A most bold move,&quot; she gestured to the club around her.

        &quot;I can&#39;t hide from Ohtori,&quot; Utena said softly in reply, &quot;I never 
could, and running away from her isn&#39;t my style.&quot;

        &quot;No, I suppose not,&quot; Himiko spoke up from her lover&#39;s side. Her 
brown hair fell into her hair, studying Utena thoughtfully. &quot;Is 
Saya...?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Utena said simply. She saw a flash of pain in Miyu&#39;s eyes 
and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

        &quot;She was a troubled soul,&quot; Miyu said softly. She looked to where 
Utena still carried the katana Saya had tossed her, &quot;Will you continue 
to wield that?&quot;

        Utena hefted the blade, her expression thoughtful, &quot;Yes, I think 
so.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Miyu smiled slightly, &quot;the weapon carries much honor.&quot;

        Juri listened to them talk intently, her eyes dark. &quot;Utena tells 
me you faced Mrs. Ohtori before,&quot; she said, &quot;do you think this party 
will draw her out?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Miyu agreed, &quot;her pride would not allow her to ignore 
it.&quot; She paused before adding, &quot;Mrs. Ohtori has not slain anyone, since 
coming here to Tokyo. She has turned a few willingly to vampires, but 
other than that...&quot;

        &quot;I wonder why she would do that,&quot; Utena said, studying Miyu 
intently She wished that she had something to do with her hands, the 
nervousness churning deep within her. &quot;When we talked before,&quot; Utena 
finally said, &quot;I got the feeling you were holding something back.&quot; A 
pause, &quot;Something about my powers, I think.&quot;

        &quot;Miyu wouldn&#39;t do that...&quot; Himiko started to protest, only to 
have Miyu hold up a silencing hand, meeting Utena&#39;s eyes.

        &quot;There are things that I did not think you were ready to hear,&quot; 
Miyu looked at Utena measuringly, &quot;do you believe you are ready now?&quot;

        &quot;Probably not,&quot; Utena answered frankly, feeling amused by Miyu&#39;s 
mild surprise, &quot;but if things go badly tonight, I may not get another 
chance to ask.&quot;

        Miyu chuckled softly, &quot;You are most wise, Utena, seizing a 
chance like this.&quot; She spoke softly, &quot;There are tales of a power hidden 
within the vampires, a power that some say could revolutionize the 
entire world.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not that powerful...&quot; Utena began.

        &quot;Nor was the first one whom possessed that power at first,&quot; Miyu 
said. &quot;Dios was a good and honorable man, until that power twisted and 
corrupted him. It took the heroism of his vampire sister to stop him, 
whom slew herself after committing that dark deed.&quot;

        &quot;The power corrupts,&quot; Utena murmured.

        &quot;Why have I never heard of this before?&quot; Juri asked.

        &quot;You are both still so young,&quot; Miyu said gravely, &quot;with much to 
learn about your kind and your own potentials.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Utena agreed. She puffed out a sigh, &quot;If this 
power I have is this Power of Dios, what does that mean?&quot;

        &quot;The elders will become aware of you,&quot; Miyu said, &quot;some fearing 
that power, others seeking to use it for their own advantage.&quot;

        &quot;Marvelous,&quot; Juri muttered softly.

        Miyu rose from her seat, her long black hair falling over her 
shoulders. &quot;When the time comes to face Mrs. Ohtori,&quot; she said softly, 
&quot;remember that battle is not the only option.&quot;

        &quot;Hey, wait a minute,&quot; Utena started to say only to have both 
women seemingly disappear on her. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she sighed as she got up 
out of her seat to look around her irritably, &quot;I hate it when people do 
that to me.&quot;

        &quot;Is she always that helpful?&quot; Juri asked, looking around her 
warily.

        &quot;She was actually a bit more talkative this time,&quot; Utena 
admitted.

        There was the sound of a disturbance outside, and Juri felt a 
familiar and dangerous presence. &quot;She&#39;s here,&quot; Juri said softly, 
remembering it from back at the academy.

        Utena nodded slightly, feeling that power. &quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; she 
agreed.
