<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 10 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/hananai-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Juri&#39;s heart began to race rapidly as she picked up the dual-bladed 
item, holding it in a surprisingly relaxed hand. She&#39;d never done 
anything like this before, nor had she the need to. She looked at the 
object in her hand and then to Utena&#39;s backside. The young duelist sat 
there on her bedside, her back straight and her fists clenched.

&quot;What are you waiting for, sempai?? Just hurry up and do it! I can&#39;t 
take it anymore! It&#39;ll be less painful this way! I&#39;m certain of it!&quot; 
Utena&#39;s voice was bold, yet a tint of nervousness was noticeable. Juri 
shrugged somewhat confidently and approached Utena. She collected 
Utena&#39;s hair in her hand to pull it away from her narrow neck and raised 
her weapon.

&quot;Are you ready? There&#39;s no turning back once I do this, you know that, 
right?&quot; Juri asked as she brought the blades to the back of Utena&#39;s 
neck.

&quot;Yes, I know, now just do it!&quot; Utena didn&#39;t really want to do this at 
all, but she knew she had no choice. She couldn&#39;t stay this way.

&quot;Okay, here goes nothing...&quot; Juri clenched her teeth and moved the blade 
in for the kill. Utena hadn&#39;t even heard the sound of the slice and it 
was over. &quot;All right, Utena...it&#39;s all over now...&quot; Juri said silently 
as her hands dropped to her sides, the dual-bladed item in one 
hand...and the major length of Utena&#39;s hair in the other.

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Utena said aloud. She turned her head and looked at Juri 
who had an odd expression on her face.

&quot;You were expecting it to be painful??&quot; Juri said as she raised the 
clenched fist of hair and shook it at Utena who just sat there with a 
smirk on her face.

&quot;Well...no...but I didn&#39;t think it be that fast,&quot; Utena said as she ran 
her hand through her now boyishly short hair. &quot;Does it look okay? I 
mean...it&#39;s so short! It doesn&#39;t look stupid, does it??&quot; Utena asked, 
expecting to be made fun of.

&quot;It&#39;s fine, so quit playing with it!&quot; Juri said with slight annoyance. 
&quot;It was necessary anyway. We don&#39;t want Shintaro to have any advantages. 
Long hair will just give him a better handhold. You have to make some 
sacrifices, okay?&quot;

&quot;I know...but I&#39;ve never cut my hair before. It&#39;s just...weird. Do you 
think Himemiya will like it?&quot;

&quot;Look...can we worry about this later? We have more important things to 
worry about right now. The school day is almost over and he&#39;ll be 
expecting you right away, understand?&quot; Utena nodded, her original 
nervousness returning at a steady rate.

&quot;Sorry, sempai. I&#39;m just trying to avoid my nerves right now...&quot; Utena 
muttered, fidgeting with her short locks.

&quot;Don&#39;t fret so much. It&#39;s hard, but I&#39;m positive...that you can make a 
miracle happen...just like you always do...&quot; Juri said as she placed a 
hand on Utena&#39;s shoulder. The pink-headed duelist smiled sweetly and 
nodded. Juri blushed slightly before clearing her throat. &quot;...well, 
anyway! I think I&#39;ve done just about all I can for you. I know you&#39;re 
ready. I&#39;m going to go and get myself situated near the dueling arena. 
I&#39;ll be watching you from afar and Anthy will be there, too...so you 
aren&#39;t alone. Be strong, Utena...&quot; Juri said as she turned and left 
without another word. Utena looked at the door Juri had exited through 
thoughtfully before she rose off the bed and walked to the messy pile of 
luggage that had yet to be organized. She dug through several bags and 
things before stumbling upon a jacket. She pulled it out and held it up 
in front of her. It was a uniform similar to hers, but white with thick, 
black trim and matching pants. Utena smiled, remembering that it had 
been given to her by Anthy and Wakaba. Since the two had become more 
friendly with one another, they attempted to be good friends. They had 
made the uniform together in their sewing class and gave the finished 
product to Utena, saying it reminded them of her. She had accepted it 
gracefully, but did not wear it for fear of ruining the wonderful new 
garment. It had a sentimental value that she could not ignore, so she 
decided to wear it for her big duel to help remind her whom she was 
fighting for.

&quot;...the people whom I want to protect...the people I love.&quot; Utena said 
to herself as she laid the uniform on the bed and began to wrap her body 
with her bandages, despite their minor protection. Then, for the first 
time, she put on the meticulously made uniform, marveling at how Anthy 
and Wakaba were able to make it to where it fit just right. After 
running a hand through her short locks and giving herself a once over in 
the mirror, she grabbed a sword given to her by Juri and exited her 
lonely dorm, hoping that after this duel, she would be able to leave it 
for good. &quot;It&#39;s time to create my future.&quot;

Shintaro stood in the room her shared with Anthy, looking at himself in 
a full-length mirror and performing sword techniques...lamely. Anthy 
knelt at the table in the center of the room, smiling to herself at her 
&quot;victor&#39;s&quot; foolish stances.

&quot;I&#39;ve got this one in the bag, Anthy. You&#39;re little &#145;prince&#39; won&#39;t ever 
be able to stop me. I&#39;m much stronger now and her frequent trips to the 
infirmary have more than put her out of practice!&quot; Shintaro&#39;s smirk grew 
at the thought of inflicting more pain to his opponent.

&quot;Of course, Shintaro-sama. As you say...&quot; Anthy spoke in her obedient, 
monotone voice, humoring the boy. &#145;He will never defeat 
Utena-sama...there is no chance...&#39; The Hanayome thought, allowing her 
smile to grow a little more despite Keingo&#39;s presence. Anthy&#39;s thoughts 
were interrupted quickly as the door slammed open to reveal Akio 
standing in the frame.

&quot;Shintaro...stupid boy, stop fooling around. You&#39;re wasting time. Don&#39;t 
you have somewhere to be?&quot; Akio looked annoyed.

&quot;Jeez, lighten up, Ohtori...I&#39;m just getting psyched for my bout! You 
can&#39;t rush perfection, ya know!&quot; Keingo said in his usual cocky tone.

&quot;Exactly, so get moving, now!&quot; Akio shouted before returning to his 
room. Anthy looked emotionless, but inside was laughing loudly at the 
insult thrown by Akio. Keingo wasn&#39;t so amused. He threw his fist into 
the mirror, feeling the glass splinter beneath his knuckles.

&quot;If it weren&#39;t for the power I&#39;d gain from this victory...I&#39;d put my 
blade through him instead...&quot; Shintaro muttered angrily before grabbing 
Anthy by the wrist and heading for the arena.

The silence in the spacious arena was deafening. Not a sound could be 
heard at all as the elevator reached it&#39;s highest point. Shintaro Keingo 
stepped out, pulling Anthy behind him. Despite his self-proclaimed 
victory, the cocky swordsman stayed alert. They were the only ones 
there, which came as no surprise to Keingo.

&quot;Che...that foolish coward...she must have bailed. Wise decision!&quot; 
Keingo raised his arms above his head, stretching.

&quot;Don&#39;t count me out, yet! Overconfidence will be your downfall!&quot; The 
voice echoed across the arena. Keingo smirked at Utena&#39;s reply.

&quot;Then show yourself, coward! I haven&#39;t got all day! I have some power to 
claim!&quot; Keingo replied. They looked the edge of the arena that met the 
steps. Soon, the two could see someone coming up. A familiar shade of 
pink came into view, followed by angry, azure eyes and a smirk. Utena 
reached the top step, glaring at her enemy.

&quot;Would have been nice if you&#39;d returned the elevator, Keingo. Those 
steps sure are murderous, hm?&quot; Utena said sarcastically.

&quot;Well aren&#39;t you looking masculine, today, Tenjou-kun. Love the hair, by 
the way. Very manly!&quot; Keingo taunted her appearance, but Utena remained 
stern.

&quot;Ha...well, I thought this would be more appropriate. I wouldn&#39;t want 
your defeat by a woman to be too humiliating. At least if I look like a 
boy, you may be able to retain some of your pathetic dignity, don&#39;t you 
think?&quot; Utena then raised her sword, pointing it at Keingo, before 
closing her eyes and popping her neck. &quot;Enough idle banter. Today, I 
reclaim my peaceful life...with your downfall!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see, won&#39;t we. Anthy! The roses, now!&quot; Keingo bellowed. Anthy 
waited for Utena to take center arena before approaching the duelists. 
She placed the sickly-gray rose upon Keingo&#39;s chest, then turned and 
placed the white one onto Utena&#39;s.

&quot;Do your best, Utena-sama...I am faithful in your victory.&quot; Anthy spoke 
softly before moving away from the pair.

Juri stood firm as she peered through the opera-glasses at the ensuing 
bout. She knew a verbal duel was occurring between the two opponents as 
she saw Utena&#39;s semi-cocky body language, but had confidence in her 
judgment. She shook her head and smirked.

&quot;Always a verbal duel with those two, it seems. It would be much less 
painful that way, but oh well.&quot; Juri let out a sigh, but quickly 
stiffened as she saw Utena approach the center of the arena. &quot;It&#39;s 
time...&quot; Juri muttered as she peered through the lens more carefully.

&quot;...Sempai?&quot; Juri turned swiftly, a hand clutching her chest as she 
gasped. Her eyes fell on Kaoru Miki. &quot;Forgive me, sempai...I...I 
followed you here.&quot;

&quot;N...no. You just startled me. Why are you here?&quot;

&quot;I...learned that Tenjou-sempai&#39;s duel was to take place today. I...I 
wanted to be here for it. I know all about Shintaro&#39;s treachery and 
thought you may need help monitoring it. I hope you don&#39;t mind my 
company.&quot;

&quot;Of course not. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here. You&#39;re a good friend, Miki-kun.&quot; 
Miki smiled as he produced a pair of opera-glasses identical to Juri&#39;s.

&quot;Okay, sempai...I&#39;m with you.&quot;

The standoff ensued, two blades pointing at one another before a dash 
broke out and a clash of metal rang dully. Utena held her blade strong 
against Shintaro&#39;s, both pushing to throw the other off before they 
swiped past one another, but both were quick to return.

&quot;Such basic tactics, Tenjou. Haven&#39;t you improved at all? What have you 
been doing with your free time??&quot;

&quot;What do you think I&#39;ve been doing!? I&#39;ve been spending all my time 
recuperating on a count of you felt too threatened by me that you 
thought you needed to try and kill me!&quot; Utena snapped, controlling her 
anger and using a verbal retort instead of blind rage.

&quot;Me!? Threatened by you!? Ha! I was merely making your demise a little 
less humiliating!&quot; Shintaro replied with a smirk. Utena scoffed before 
swinging her blade offensively, catching her cocky opponent off guard. 
She advanced on him, sending him into a backwards frenzy of blocks and 
parries. From the sideline, Anthy couldn&#39;t hide her surprised smile. The 
sight of seeing Shintaro on the defensive was just too gratifying. Utena 
noted the edge of the arena coming up behind her opponent, but just kept 
advancing mercilessly, but unknown to Utena, Shintaro knew it was 
coming. As soon as his heel tapped the edge, he parried another blow and 
quickly dropped to the ground. Utena&#39;s eyes followed him, thinking she 
had him cornered, but didn&#39;t even have time to take a finishing strike 
before he used his crouched position to spring forward and slam his head 
into her stomach, knocking the wind out of her. Utena stumbled 
backwards, gasping for breath.

&quot;Ba...stard...&quot; Utena stammered.

&quot;Poor, Tenjou-kun...just too confident, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Keingo kept his 
blade trained on Utena as she slowly backpedaled, trying to keep her own 
blade on the defensive. Shintaro raised his sword menacingly in 
preparation to strike. Utena&#39;s eyes followed the blade, anticipating the 
attack, but was suddenly caught off guard as Shintaro grabbed her left 
wrist violently, jerking her toward him and pulling her arm roughly 
behind her back. &quot;You call this a duel, Keingo...? Let me go and put up 
your blade! This is a sword duel! I can defeat you with one hand behind 
my back! I don&#39;t need to resort to grabs and locks!&quot; Utena hissed 
between clenched teeth.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m fighting you aren&#39;t I? It&#39;s a duel as far as I&#39;m concerned!&quot; 
Shintaro whispered loudly in her ear before quickly wrenching her 
helpless arm further behind her, emitting a shrill cry of agony from the 
captive duelist as she heard the sickening pop of her newly dislocated 
shoulder. &quot;There you are, Tenjou! One arm! Now fight me!&quot; Shintaro 
shouted before shoving Utena away from him. She dropped to one knee, 
gritting her teeth from the pain that shot through her whole arm.

&quot;Dammit...me and my big mouth...&quot; Utena muttered to herself as she 
forced herself to stand. She risked a glance in Anthy&#39;s direction, 
noting the worried aura about her. Utena cast her eyes down, realizing 
she let herself get to cocky.

&quot;I&#39;m waiting, Tenjou-kun! Still got what it takes??&quot; Shintaro stood with 
his blade pointed toward the kneeling girl. Once standing fully, she 
held her sword out before taking the offensive once again. Keingo began 
to effortlessly dodge her strikes, even taking a moment to yawn 
tauntingly. Utena was becoming further enraged, but on top of trying to 
fight with the pain coursing through her, dampening the rage was 
becoming more and more difficult.

Two pairs of eyes watched intently, barely able to blink at the 
spectacle before them.

&quot;Sempai, she&#39;s losing it! All that raw emotion! She&#39;s going to fail like 
that!&quot; Miki cried as he watched the short-haired duelist throw strike 
after careless strike.

&quot;I...I don&#39;t know what to do. There isn&#39;t much we can do from here 
except monitor the duel. Unfortunately, he really hasn&#39;t done anything 
illegal. Of course, the dislocation was uncalled for, but there isn&#39;t 
anything saying it&#39;s an illegal action. I guess no one anticipated it 
since the duels are strictly sword bouts...&quot; Juri spoke softly, yet with 
a tint of worry capping her sentences. She briefly took a glance at 
Anthy and the horrified expression she bore. &quot;Himemiya...&quot;.

Utena&#39;s enraged onslaught continued and Shintaro kept on dodging, 
occasionally taking a swipe of his own. He smirked to himself, seeing 
the rage in Utena&#39;s eyes.

&quot;C&#39;mon, Tenjou...you haven&#39;t even landed a single hit. I was expecting a 
little more of a challenge!&quot; Keingo taunted. Utena raised her arm once 
again, but faked the strike, anticipating Shintaro&#39;s dodge. As soon as 
he did so, she let her blade swipe him across the bridge of his nose and 
below his left eye. Upon seeing the scarlet drip from the paper-thin 
wound, Utena could feel her rage begin to dwindle.

&quot;That&#39;s all I needed...was just one strike...&quot; Utena thought. Keingo 
leaped backward, raising his blade angrily. His eyes widened as he 
brushed his fingertip along the fine line and upon seeing the crimson 
liquid on his fingers, he broke into a rage of his own.

&quot;Tenjou!! That was a lucky shot, but it will be your last!!&quot; Keingo 
snapped. He took the Sword of Dios into both hands and began a violent 
array of attacks. Utena, once again, found herself backpedaling in 
defense. Keingo released blow after blow before lifting his foot and 
shoving it into Utena&#39;s stomach, again. As she reeled back from the blow 
to her midsection, Keingo lashed his sword down across Utena&#39;s chest and 
once again kicking her to the ground. Utena landed face first on the 
hard floor, clutching her stomach in agony. Keingo was about to strike 
again until he saw a rose petal on the ground by his opponent&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;Tenjou! I&#39;ve sliced your rose! I have defeated you!!&quot; From 
the other side of the arena, Himemiya Anthy screamed in horror.

&quot;Utena-samaaa!! Noooo!!&quot; The Bara no Hanayome hurriedly ran to Utena&#39;s 
side, gently taking the gasping duelist in her arms and turning her 
over. Upon doing so, her eyes widened in utter shock...and relief. 
&quot;Utena-sama...you...you&#39;re still in! It was just one petal! He didn&#39;t 
remove your rose! Get up, now!&quot; Anthy shook Utena and the duelist&#39;s eyes 
traveled to the white rose still resting upon her breast.

&quot;What!? No! I hit it! I am the victor!&quot; Keingo shouted in anger. Anthy 
looked up to him and smiled.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not, Shintaro...sama. The rules say you must remove the 
whole rose. This fight is not over.&quot; The bride spoke gently as she 
helped the girl up. Utena gritted her teeth as the pain in her tender 
shoulder screamed in agony. &quot;Utena-sa...san. You&#39;re injured. Can you 
duel?&quot; Utena nodded gently as she assumed her stance.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, Himemiya. Please, take your position on the sidelines. As you 
said, this duel isn&#39;t over.&quot; Utena turned back to her opponent. &quot;Shall 
we, Shintaro?&quot; The blue-eyed duelist smirked at Shintaro, emitting an 
angry grunt from him. He raised his sword and in blind rage, charged 
toward Utena. The fortunate duelist raised her sword with her good hand 
and charged as well. &quot;Is this it? The finishing strike?&quot; Utena thought 
as she ran toward Shintaro, her teeth grit in determination. &quot;Here I 
come, Himemiya...I will win and we&#39;ll be together.&quot; The two came closer 
and closer and then the finishing strike ensued. Both duelists passed 
one another after the blows were dealt. Simultaneously, they looked to 
their roses. Shintaro stared in shock at his rose...still resting upon 
his chest. He was about to turn to stare down at the loser, but was met 
with a pain through his chest. Shintaro Keingo looked over his shoulder 
to see Utena still standing in her finishing stance, but with her sword 
pointed behind her. He turned his head back slowly to see the end of 
Utena&#39;s blade protruding from his chest...blood dripping from it&#39;s 
gleaming length...and his rose resting upon the pointed tip. It hit 
him...as soon as Tenjou Utena passed by him, she had quickly turned her 
sword around in her hand...and without another though...ran him through 
the chest, taking his rose in the process.

&quot;Victory.&quot; Utena stated simply as she looked back at Keingo over her 
shoulder. He turned back to look at Utena...his eyes half open and trail 
of blood in the corner of his mouth.

&quot;Touch&eacute;...Tenjou-kun. So you...had murderous...intentions...all along. 
You&#39;ll need them...if you expect...to survive...your next duel. 
Ha...I&#39;ll...see you in hell...Tenjou Utena...&quot; And without another word, 
Shintaro Keingo fell forward, sliding off of Utena&#39;s blade before 
hitting the arena floor, dead.

&quot;Oh! Utena-sama!! You did it!!&quot; Anthy ran to her victor, arms open wide 
before throwing herself into Utena, causing the victorious duelist to 
wince.

&quot;Y...yeah, Himemiya, I did, but please, not so hard...my shoulder is 
still dislocated,&quot; Utena hissed in pain. Anthy blushed before releasing 
her.

&quot;Forgive me, Utena-sama. I couldn&#39;t help myself. I&#39;m just...so...so...&quot;

&quot;I know, Himemiya...I am, too...&quot; Utena stated simply before dropping 
her weapon to the floor and painfully exiting the arena with her 
reclaimed love by her side.

From afar, Arisugawa Juri and Kaoru Miki were stunned. Was this an 
acceptable victory?</pre>
