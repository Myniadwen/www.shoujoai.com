<h1>Captain of the Guard (part 9 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/captain-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Utena&#39;s eyes opened up gradually, as she slowly began to awake from 
her long night of rest. The morning sunlight touched everything that 
she saw with a golden glow, making her bedroom look like a magical 
place. The bed was very comfortable, and she just wanted to stay there 
and continue sleeping, but something drove her to wakefulness. A soft 
noise brought her attention to the other side of her bed, and her eyes 
widened in surprise.

A fully dressed Princess Anthy lay on the bed right beside her, still 
sleeping soundly. Her long dark hair was fanned all around her, and 
her face was made even more innocent seeming by the soft touch of 
sleep. She looked so beautiful, laying there, that all Utena could 
bring herself to do was simply gaze upon her in awe.

At least, until certain inconvenient questions began to trouble her 
sleepy mind. &#39;What in the world happened last night?&#39; Utena wondered, 
trying to remember. Her thoughts were hazy, still muddled by sleep, 
but they eventually became more clear.

&#39;Juri was hurt when she dueled Ruka,&#39; she began to remember, &#39;and then 
Dios healed her.&#39; She remembered talking to Juri, Anthy and Shiori 
just afterwards, and then everything just faded out. &#39;I must have 
collapsed,&#39; Utena thought, a bit of a blush to her cheeks.

She gently pulled herself from the bed, careful not to disturb the 
sleeping girl there. Utena was tempted to bend over and place a gentle 
kiss on those smiling lips, but it wasn&#39;t her place. She pulled out a 
fresh uniform and then quietly padded out of the room.

A young chambermaid was cleaning up the Princess&#39; bedroom, looking 
around her just a bit worriedly. She saw Utena, &quot;Captain, has the 
Princess already left?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s still fast asleep,&quot; Utena said, nodding back towards her own 
bedroom. The maid&#39;s eyes got round with surprise, and with a frown on 
her face Utena quickly added &quot;She fell asleep watching over me after I 
collapsed.&quot;

The maid looked rather skeptical at that little explanation, and Utena 
wondered what sort of rumors would soon be circulating around the 
castle. Deciding to leave that alone for now, she ordered &quot;Let her 
sleep a bit longer, please.&quot;

The maid curtsied and then left Utena alone to wash up and then change 
into her uniform. Stepping out into the hallway, she saw Tsuwabuki 
running towards her. He skidded to a stop, leaning up against the wall 
to gasp out, &quot;Kiryuu has escaped!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Utena barked angrily, and not waiting for an answer went off 
to see for herself. Down halls, then the stairs, until finally they 
reached the old dungeons themselves. Utena slowed as they neared the 
cell, feeling a chill sensation that she recognized from years on the 
battlefield. &quot;Magic,&quot; she muttered to herself softly.

Tsuwabuki looked up at her wide eyed, and with that expression he 
looked much younger than he actually was. &quot;It happened last night,&quot; he 
said to her softly, &quot;we think when the change of shift was going on.&quot;

Utena looked at the shattered door, and from an angle she looked into 
the cell, careful not to step inside. &quot;Go get me Shiori,&quot; she ordered 
him softly, &quot;I think she might be able to trace the caster of these 
magics.&quot;

A faint blush appeared on Tsuwabuki&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Juri specifically 
ordered that they not be disturbed,&quot; he said quietly, looking honestly 
worried.

Utena smiled at him grimly, &quot;And I&#39;m ordering you to wake her.&quot; She 
took pity on him, &quot;Just tell her that I overruled her, OK?&quot;

Tsuwabuki smiled his relief, &quot;Thanks, Captain.&quot; He bolted off to get 
her like the devils themselves were chasing him.

Not long after Juri and Shiori hastened their way down the hallway 
together. Utena tried not to smile at the signs of hasty dressing they 
both showed. &quot;Sorry to disturb you,&quot; Utena said quietly, giving them a 
moment to catch their breaths.

Shiori, as soon as she even got near to the cells, came to a dead 
stop.

&quot;What?&quot; Juri asked her quietly, putting her hand on Shiori&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;You feel it too?&quot; Utena asked Shiori.

Shiori nodded grimly in reply, &quot;Magic.&quot; She walked more carefully 
towards the cell door, her expression deeply troubled as she reported 
back, &quot;It&#39;s similar to the dark magics that were spread all around the 
castle.&quot;

&quot;More proof that Kiryuu was connected to Akio,&quot; Juri said grimly.

&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Utena said to herself thoughtfully. She looked over 
at Shiori, &quot;You said similar, not the same, am I right?&quot;

Shiori nodded, &quot;Very similar. But I&#39;m not certain if it&#39;s the same 
person or not.&quot; Her face brightened, &quot;But whoever it was didn&#39;t clean 
up all the evidence.&quot; Very smug now, &quot;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s enough residual 
magic to trace back to it&#39;s source.&quot; She walked into the cell 
carefully, her hands held out in front of her, enshrouded with a soft 
glow.

&#39;Yet all the dark magic we have encountered in the castle before was 
untraceable,&#39; Utena found herself wondering, &#39;Why is it so different 
now?&#39; Her eyes widened, and she barked out, &quot;Shiori! Get out of there 
now!&quot;

When the mage didn&#39;t move fast enough, Juri grabbed her by the collar 
and yanked her backwards, even as the cell itself exploded in a sudden 
wash of fire and light. It lasted only seconds, confined to the cell, 
and once it faded they each took a breath before surveying the damage.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri murmured to Utena softly, holding the badly shaken 
up Shiori close to her.

Utena just nodded, looking cautiously into the cell. The heat had been 
so intense that the walls had melted a bit. The armored window&#39;s glass 
had puddled to the ground, leaving a silvery pool. The room was wiped 
clean, no trace left of whom had once been there.

&quot;I should have spotted the trap,&quot; Shiori said softly, adding, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Utena.&quot; She had started to shake a bit, as how close she had 
come to death began to really register on her. &#39;Back in the 
mercenaries I would have spotted it,&#39; Shiori thought, &#39;have I gotten 
too soft?&#39;

&quot;They are going to pay for this,&quot; Utena said softly but intensely. 
&quot;You do not try to kill my people and get away with it,&quot; she vowed 
softly.

Juri, if possible, looked even angrier. &quot;When I get my hands on 
Kiryuu,&quot; she growled, &quot;he&#39;ll wish he was the one who tripped that!&quot;

&quot;Ah-HEM!&quot; Shiori cleared her throat loudly. Both women looked startled 
as she added, &quot;Just don&#39;t let your anger cloud your judgment. That was 
the other purpose of this, and if you both get mad, it&#39;ll have 
succeeded.&quot;

Juri looked down at Shiori a moment, then she smiled. &quot;As wise as you 
are beautiful,&quot; she murmured softly, &quot;you&#39;re probably right.&quot;

Utena nodded, accepting that point. Seriously, &quot;Juri, I want you back 
investigating Ruka. Find out who hired him, and we may find out who 
did this.&quot;

&quot;Would you mind if Shiori accompanies me?&quot; Juri asked.

A slight smile from Utena, &quot;As long as she doesn&#39;t distract you too 
badly.&quot; Shiori pouted at that, but agreed.

&quot;What about you?&quot; Juri asked softly.

Utena smiled grimly. &quot;Up till now, I&#39;ve been playing the gentleman,&quot; 
she said, making a face. &quot;But I think I&#39;m going to forget my manners 
and start shaking some people until they tell what I need to know,&quot; 
she said with an evil look.

Juri smiled, &quot;Kanae and Saionji?&quot;

A grim nod, &quot;Kanae and Saionji.&quot;



Anthy frowned sleepily, noting that it was cooler, somehow. She opened 
her eyes, expecting to see Utena, and noticed the other side of the 
bed was empty. She looked around, noticing that the closet was open 
and some of Utena&#39;s clothes were gone, but other than that it was 
undisturbed. Easing herself out of the bed, she paused, hearing 
voices.

&quot;I&#39;m going to wake the Princess,&quot; Utena&#39;s familiar voice said, &quot;make 
sure there&#39;s some breakfast ready for her.&quot;

One of the maids answered, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Anthy took a step forward, but the door was opening already. Utena 
walked in, they bumped into each other, and with a soft cry they both 
fell to the ground in a tangle of limbs. Anthy stared into Utena&#39;s 
eyes, her cheeks flaming as she felt her bosom pressed up against 
Utena&#39;s own, Hands seeking purchase to push them both up accidentally 
brushing along Anthy&#39;s thigh.

&quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry,&quot; a flaming Utena stammered once they both got to 
their feet.

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Anthy answered, her own cheeks burning. &quot;Did I hear 
you say there&#39;s breakfast?&quot; Anthy asked.

Utena smiled back at her, &quot;It should be ready soon. Why not change and 
freshen up,&quot; she suggested, &quot;and we&#39;ll go eat together?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Anthy smiled. Without really thinking about it, she 
began to strip off last night&#39;s clothes.

&quot;I&#39;ll just wait out side,&quot; Utena blurted, and then fled into the 
hallway. She shut the door firmly, leaning on it as she sighed softly.

&quot;What happened to you?&quot; Miki asked curiously, coming up to Anthy&#39;s 
door.

&quot;You don&#39;t want to know,&quot; Utena sighed. She noticed he wasn&#39;t carrying 
his usual schedule, so she asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;I heard about what happened down in the dungeon,&quot; Miki answered, &quot;so 
I cleared her schedule for today as a precaution.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a good man,&quot; Utena smiled, slapping him on the shoulder.

Miki winced a bit, rubbing the spot she hit. &quot;I do try, ma&#39;am. Duty 
calls,&quot; he said, and took his leave of her.

There was a soft tap behind her, and Utena opened the door. Anthy 
smiled up at her, dressed in a simple but comfortable dress that 
suited her quite well.

&quot;Shall we go to breakfast?&quot; Utena asked, offering her arm.

Anthy took it, smiling, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; Just then her stomach growled 
softly. Utena&#39;s growled in reply, then both women broke out laughing.

&quot;Let&#39;s eat before we faint from hunger,&quot; Utena laughed. They descended 
on the breakfast table and both ordered extras, to the surprise of the 
serving maids.

&quot;Did we eat at all last night?&quot; Anthy asked Utena as she put jam on 
her toast.

&quot;Not that I remember,&quot; Utena answered Anthy between eating spoonfuls 
of her large bowl of cereal. &quot;You were going to go eat after the 
petitions were over, then we all got a bit... distracted,&quot; she 
recalled.

&quot;Well, you did fall right over,&#39; Anthy said conversationally, all the 
while carefully cracking her hard boiled egg.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t my fault,&quot; Utena protested. &quot;If Juri hadn&#39;t let herself be 
stabbed, I&#39;d have been fine,&quot; she grumbled.

The two shared a smile, then went back to eating their breakfasts. </pre>
