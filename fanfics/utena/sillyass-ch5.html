<h1>Silly Assed Utena X-Over Fic (part 5 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/sillyass-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Yue stood on the roof of the east dorm, his wings out stretched for 
balance. He looked intense as he gazed off into the distance 
broodingly. He heard a soft sound, and turned to see a black hared 
young man in school uniform land nearby, his white wings gleaming.

&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know this roof was occupied.&quot; He 
bows, saying &quot;I&#39;m Kaumi.&quot;

Yue smiles and shrugs, &quot;Happens all the time. I&#39;m Yue,&quot; he said, and 
looked thoughtful. &quot;I think the library is unoccupied tonight, try 
there.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kaumi said cheerfully, and flew off.

&quot;Who was that?&quot; Keroberos asked.

&quot;Kaumi, typical tormented bishonen,&quot; Yue commented dryly.

Inside the dorm, the hallways were mostly empty, everyone tucked away 
in bed. It wasn&#39;t at all quiet, however. Hitomi groaned loudly, and 
covered her head with a pillow to keep the noise out. &#39;Kozue was 
right, Michiru is a screamer,&#39; Hitomi thought with a resigned sigh. 
She groaned again and wrapped the pillow more firmly around her head 
as next door, she could hear Haruka and Michiru starting up again.

A few doors down, Usagi smiled sexily as she slowly walked over to the 
bed. Rei Hino lay there, her arms and legs tied to the bedposts. Usagi 
climbed on the bed in her much racier version of her sailor fuku 
clinging, the short skirt revealing bare bottom. &quot;In the name of the 
moon,&quot; she said in a sexy whisper, laying down on top of Rei, &quot;I will 
punish you.&quot;

Across the way, Sakura looked over at Tomoyo with an odd expression on 
her face. &quot;Are you sure this is a good idea?&quot; she asked timidly.

Tomoyo smiled at her sunnily. &quot;I&#39;m sure it will be fine,&quot; she said, 
and gently led Sakura over to the bed. Before she lay down beside her, 
she made sure the tripod mounted camera was aimed properly at the 
center of the bed.

Sakura sweatdropped.

Noin frowned severely down at Lady Une, dressed in her full uniform. 
Une was dressed as a private, her uniform torn and in disarray. 
&quot;You&#39;re a disgrace to this army, Private!&quot; Noin barked.

&quot;Please don&#39;t kick me out! I&#39;ll do anything!&quot; a kneeling Une mock 
pleaded.

Noin smiled evily down at her. &quot;Anything?&quot; she said in a dangerous 
whisper. She grasped the back of Une&#39;s head and drew her forward.

Asuka Langly blushed, as she and Rei Ayanami got ready to go to bed. 
&quot;Do we have to wear them?&quot; she asked plaintively.

&quot;But Asuka, you look so good in it,&quot; Rei answered with a sultry smile.

Asuka sighed. &quot;Rei, I never knew you were a closet hentai,&quot; Asuka 
remarked, holding up her Eva uniform, with certain sections cut out by 
Rei.

Rei pouted, and batted her eyes at Asuka. &quot;Please?&quot;

Asukas&#39;s shoulders slumped, and she began to pull on the suit.

Nene sat cross legged on her bed and bawled. &quot;Everybody&#39;s got somebody 
but me!&quot; she complained bitterly. There was a soft knock on the door, 
so Nene dried her eyes, got up and answered it. Her eyes widened. 
Linna stood in the doorway, dressed in green bra and panties, and a 
green, silk nightie.

She grins at Nene&#39;s expression. &quot;Sylia insisted on giving me a color 
coordinated set,&quot; she explained. She looked Nene over seductively, and 
said &quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep, and I was wondering if you wanted some 
company.&quot;

Nene didn&#39;t say anything, just gently pulled Linna into the room.

In the basement, behind a heavy door, the sound of a whip crack, and 
leather striking flesh could be heard. &quot;I wonder what our friends 
would think,&quot; one voice said, &quot;if they knew you were the bottom, 
Ryouko?&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t tell them, Ayeka,&quot; a breathy voice answered. A soft, 
painful cry.

&quot;Call me Mistress,&quot; the first voice said, over the sounds of moaning.

You&#39;re Under Arrest...

Natsumi sat back in the passenger seat and looked with admiration over 
at her partner. Miyuki drove the police car with her particular grace 
and style, even through the mobbed streets of Ohtori academy. &quot;This is 
one weird place, huh?&quot; Natsumi commented.

&quot;Interesting, though,&quot; Miyuki said smiling.

Before they can say anything more, a woman&#39;s screaming could be heard 
over the noise of the crowd! &quot;Whaa! Help! Utena, save me! No, don&#39;t 
touch me there!&quot; A short pause, and &quot;Or there, either!&quot;

The Red Queen broke through the crown first, then Ms. Door, the 
Cheshire Cat, and the entire Mad Tea Party, all helping carry the 
loudly yelling Wakaba! Just behind them, the leather clad Miyuki-chan 
cracks her whip and keeps chasing. The two police officers watch them 
run by, sweatdropping.

Utena staggers out of the crowd, soaked with sweat and exhausted. She 
slumps against the police car, and groans out &quot;Can you help me catch 
them?&quot;

Miyuki pops the backdoor open even as Natsumi yells, &quot;Get in!&quot; They 
peel off in hot persuit. &quot;Hey, Miyuki?&quot; Natsumi asked, as they chased 
the whole mad group, &quot;Isn&#39;t that your namesake over there, with the 
whip?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Miyuki said, sighing. &quot;You know how many people 
have dropped off love leters at our room because of her?&quot;

Natsumi laughed, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot;

Miyuki tilted her head and looked over at her thoughtfuly. Before she 
could think of a reply, Utena stuck her head up between the seats. 
&quot;Personally, I really don&#39;t want to mess with the crazy leather lady. 
Why don&#39;t we just grab Wababa and leave them to their fun?&quot; Utena 
suggested wearily.

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Miyuki said with a nod.

Natsumi held Utena&#39;s waist as they pulled up beside the madly running 
group and Utena carefully leaned over to grab Wakaba. Wakaba reached, 
clambered over Utena into the police car, and they began to pull away. 
However, before they could get away, Natsumi lost her grip on Utena! 
&quot;Oh, hell.&quot; Natsumi cursed.

&quot;Whaa!&quot; Utena loudly cried as she was carried off by the mob. &quot;God 
must hate me! Oh, that tickles!&quot;

&quot;Well, one out of two&#39;s not bad,&quot; Natsumi sighed. Wakaba stumbled off 
to change and rest, while Miyuki and Natsumi cruised to the lookout 
over Ohtori.

Miyuki parked, seemingly nervous. She suddenly climbed out of the car 
and clambered up on the hood, sitting there in the evening sunlight. 
She smiled a bit, as Natsumi climbed up beside her. &quot;It&#39;s quite the 
view from here,&quot; Miyuki said nervously. Natsumi just smiled over at 
her fondly, and Miyuki gathered up her courage to say &quot;Nastsumi, I... 
I mean, I...&quot;

Natsumi gently stopped Miyuki from saying anything more. &quot;Miyuki, I&#39;m 
in love with you,&quot; she said shyly.

Miyuki&#39;s eyes widened, and then she smiled broadly. &quot;Took you long 
enough to realise!&quot; she cried, and hugged her. &quot;I love you, too!&quot;

Natsumi sweatdropped. </pre>
