<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 14 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>        Anthy all but charged down the hallway away from the suite, 
heading for the stairway again. She took the steps two at a time, her 
fury driving her onward to the top. The door to the roof slammed open 
with a very satisfying bang, and she froze, gazing at the two figures 
laying there on the rooftop in a tangle of pale limbs.

        &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?!&quot; Anthy blurted out angrily.

        Juri rose up smoothly, her long, lean body exposed to the 
moonlight, her long orange hair flowing around her. &quot;If you don&#39;t know 
that,&quot; she said with a wry smile, &quot;then I&#39;m certainly not the one to 
explain it to you.&quot;

        &quot;Juri,&quot; Utena gently scolded her as she grabbed for her top. 
She pulled it on to give her some cover as she looked over at Anthy, 
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean for you to find out like this.&quot;

        Anthy met her eyes, her gaze shimmering with anger, &quot;If you 
felt this way for her, why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; She shot a glare at 
Juri, &quot;If you had told me, we could have...&quot;

        &quot;Do you want to talk to her alone,&quot; Juri ignored Anthy to 
softly ask Utena, &quot;or do you want me to stick around?&quot;

        &quot;Stay,&quot; was Utena&#39;s quiet answer. She looked up to meet 
Anthy&#39;s intense gaze, &quot;I don&#39;t think I realized how much I felt for 
her myself, not until we...&quot;

        &quot;Oh. of course,&quot; Anthy spat out angrily. She fixed Juri with a 
look that might have killed a lesser person and cried, &quot;This is all 
your fault. You seduced her once before, and now you&#39;re using that 
again to try and hold on to her!&quot; Anthy didn&#39;t even see Utena move she 
was that fast, the slap to her cheek sudden and stinging.

        &quot;Don&#39;t you dare say that about her,&quot; Utena said crisply. Her 
eyes darkened, &quot;Juri may have started it, but I most willingly went 
along.&quot; With more regret in her voice she continued, &quot;If you want to 
blame anyone, Anthy, blame me.&quot;

        Anthy&#39;s hand was held to her cheek, feeling the throbbing 
there. &quot;Why not me, Utena?&quot; Anthy finally had to ask, &quot;Why her, and 
not me?&quot; She remembered Wakaba saying something similar, and her lips 
twisted in bitter memory.

        &quot;You&#39;re good,&quot; Utena said to her softly, hesitantly reaching 
for her only to have Anthy step away. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to... sully you.&quot;

        Anthy looked at her, then began to laugh. It wasn&#39;t a pleasant 
laugh, and it didn&#39;t last very long. &quot;You have no clue,&quot; Anthy shook 
her head. Her eyes glittered, &quot;Do you know of all the lovers I took 
before I met you? Of the life I lived then?&quot;

        &quot;I...&quot; Utena trailed off.

        &quot;And now you never will,&quot; Anthy said to Utena softly. The dark 
skinned vampiress looked at her for a moment, long purple hair blowing 
around her face, then she turned around silently and disappeared down 
the stairway.

        There was a long moment of silence on the roof. &quot;Thank you for 
defending me,&quot; Juri murmured as she began to pull her own clothes on, 
&quot;No one&#39;s ever done that for me before.&quot;

        A single, blood red tear streaked down Utena&#39;s face, but she 
didn&#39;t seem to notice it. &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she sighed, and reached 
down to grab her panties from the roof. The two women got dressed 
quickly, pulling on their clothes, then descended the steps.

        &quot;Now we get to tell the rest of them,&quot; Juri smiled wryly.

        Ruka and Shiori weren&#39;t terribly surprised, of course. Wakaba 
had the oddest look on her face, and Utena&#39;s harem seemed to take all 
of it quite well. In fact, most of them were give Juri some rather... 
thoughtful looks.

        &#39;I don&#39;t want to know,&#39; Utena quickly decided.

        There was a noise from Utena&#39;s bedroom, and Anthy emerged 
carrying her one suitcase. &quot;Anthy,&quot; Wakaba looked over at her in 
surprise, &quot;what are you...&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m leaving,&quot; Anthy cut her off crisply. She looked over at 
Utena, &quot;I&#39;ll be back for the party tomorrow, in case Ms. Ohtori shows 
up.&quot;

        Anthy took a few steps towards the door before Utena could 
find her voice and ask, &quot;Where are you going to go?&quot;

        &quot;I have a friend that I think will put me up,&quot; Anthy didn&#39;t 
turn to look at Utena as she answered. The door opened and shut 
quickly, and she was gone.

        &quot;It seems she didn&#39;t take it well,&quot; Shiori smiled slightly.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not upset,&quot; Juri looked down at Shiori 
thoughtfully, gazing into the purple haired girl&#39;s apparently innocent 
eyes.

        &quot;As long as you&#39;re happy, Juri-sama,&quot; Shiori smiled up 
sweetly.

        Utena looked over at Shiori and felt that odd sense of unease 
once again. She shook her head, silently hoping that Anthy would be 
all right...

        In a luxurious hotel across town, Integra Hellsing paused in 
the doorway with a slight smile. Her night gown was an older style, 
concealing her lean body, her silvery gray hair flowing over her 
shoulders. As she moved forward her glasses caught the light, taking a 
puff from her cigar before crushing it out in an nearby ashtray.

        Victoria Ceres sat up on the bed, her own blonde hair messed 
gently. The smaller vampire dressed in more delicate night clothes 
smiled slightly as Integra walked towards her, softly murmuring, 
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful.&quot;

        &quot;So are you,&quot; Integra smiled back.

        Integra once had grave concerns about Arucard transforming the 
police girl, but over the years the woman had proved her worth. In the 
field she was remarkably capable, but in some ways she valued the 
bed-partner that Ceres had become even more. She was marvelously 
imaginative, tireless, and oddly safe. Both knew that their affair 
could be ended at any time, so they embraced each and every moment 
that they could.

        As Integra slid down onto the bed beside her Victoria 
murmured, &quot;You and Anthy, you were once lovers, right?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Integra shivered a bit as Victoria pushed the robe off 
her shoulder, kissing bare flesh, &quot;how did you know?&quot;

        &quot;After we met her at the bar,&quot; Victoria sighed happily, gentle 
hands stroking her pale arms, &quot;you were so excited.&quot; She gave her 
wicked smile, &quot;You were remembering what happened between you when we 
were talking?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Integra conceded it softly, shivering slightly as sharp 
fangs gently grazed her skin, cool flesh pressing against her own.

        &quot;What was she like?&quot; Victoria asked, feeling certain hungers 
rise as Integra pressed her warm flesh against her body.

        &quot;She was...&quot; Integra started to say, when the doorbell rang. 
Both woman swore softly.

        &quot;Do you want me to get it?&quot; Victoria asked politely.

        &quot;No,&quot; Integra sat up, pulling her robe around her once again, 
&quot;it might be official business, and they&#39;d be a bit startled if you 
answered it.&quot; She strode out, anger providing some speed to her step, 
silently vowing that if it was a foolish request the person was going 
to pay dearly. She whipped the door open on the next ring, only to 
freeze in surprise.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry to disturb you,&quot; Anthy smiled a bit wryly, her 
purple hair oddly messy, so unlike the neat bun she normally wore it 
in.

        &quot;Anthy,&quot; Integra blinked. She narrowed her eyes, quickly 
taking in the signs of distress on her face to sharply ask, &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong?&quot;

        &quot;Sharp as ever,&quot; Anthy murmured softly. She smiled a bit 
reluctantly, &quot;Let&#39;s just say that I&#39;ve had to change my living 
arrangements.&quot; She took a nervous breath, &quot;Did you mean it, when you 
told me I could call on your help?&quot;

        &#39;Not quite the way I meant,&#39; Integra thought as she moved 
aside to clear the doorway. &quot;Come on in,&quot; Integra waved, &quot;you can take 
the couch.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy picked up her suitcase and went inside. As 
she passed Integra she caught the trace of a familiar scent and her 
lips twitched slightly, &quot;It seems you have company. I&#39;m doubly sorry 
to be intruding, then.&quot;

        Hearing the voice Victoria had ventured out into the living 
room, tossing a robe over her nightie. &quot;Not your fault,&quot; the blonde 
offered. She smiled at the two, &quot;Grab a seat and start catching up, 
and I&#39;ll get some tea.&quot;

        Integra felt an odd degree of unease, gazing at Anthy as she 
took a seat across from her. She wasn&#39;t used to dealing with others 
emotional problems, but that seemed to be what was troubling Anthy. 
&quot;What happened?&quot; Integra finally asked her softly.

        &quot;I was... living with someone,&quot; Anthy finally answered her 
after a long moment of silence, &quot;but it seems that she&#39;s in love with 
someone else.&quot;

        &quot;Then she&#39;s a fool,&quot; Victoria said calmly as she carried a 
tray in. She set a cup of tea in front of Integra, but the cup she 
gave Anthy had a thicker fluid. At the woman&#39;s questioning glance 
Victoria explained, &quot;Blood, with a bit of rum added. I thought you 
could use it.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy smiled, taking a long drink. Victoria moved 
over to sit beside Integra, settling there before taking a drink from 
her own cup. She saw the intimacy of their posture and smiled, &quot;You&#39;re 
lovers, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

        Integra nodded slightly, reaching over to take Victoria&#39;s 
hand. &quot;Yes, we are,&quot; she agreed quietly. She smiled as Anthy calmly 
drank, &quot;You don&#39;t seem too surprised.&quot;

        &quot;I remember our time together,&quot; Anthy agreed. She smiled 
suddenly, looking over at Victoria curiously, &quot;Is she as... inventive, 
as she used to be?&quot;

        Victoria laughed suddenly, &quot;I&#39;d say so.&quot;

        &quot;Hey!&quot; Integra scowled, somehow not coming across quite so 
fierce while dressed only in her night gown and robe.

        Victoria hesitated a moment, taking in how Anthy and Integra 
were reacting to each other. There was an odd intimacy there, even 
with all the time that had passed between them, and she smiled, 
squeezing Integra&#39;s hand. &quot;I was thinking we should get back to what 
we were doing,&quot; she said to Integra softly, her voice dropping 
seductively.

        Integra gazed at her in surprise, then over at Anthy. &quot;But 
what about...&quot;

        Victoria smiled at Anthy slyly, &quot;Would you care to join us?&quot;

        Anthy gaped at the blonde in surprise, startled by her sheer 
nerve. Integra was actually blushing slightly, but oddly the fierce 
leader of the Royal Order wasn&#39;t protesting, either. Anthy found 
herself smiling back and looking at Integra, &quot;Would you mind?&quot;

        Integra rose to her feet, pulling Victoria up beside her, then 
she offered Anthy her hand, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; She grinned, &quot;Maybe you&#39;ve 
learned some new tricks since we last did this.&quot;

        The three young women walked back to the bedroom as Anthy 
smiled slightly, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve picked up a few things here and there.&quot;
