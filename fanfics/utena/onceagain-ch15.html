<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 15 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/onceagain-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Kanako Urashima paused as the black haired woman collected the 
mid-morning mail delivery, holding the package for her close as she 
dropped off each person&#39;s items at their rooms. Su got her regular 
technology magazines, Shinobu got a letter from her mother, Motoko got a 
letter from a romance publisher, and so on and so forth.

Returning to the manager&#39;s rooms Kanako sat down by the small table 
there, unwrapping her package a bit nervously. As ordered there were 
several novels from a prominent lesbian publisher, as well as two guides 
to coming out.

&#39;I&#39;m still not sure about this,&#39; Kanako sighed, thinking of the flutter 
in her chest she felt when she looked at Motoko. A blush colored her 
cheeks and she picked up the coming out book, settling down into 
reading.

Returning to her room Motoko blushed faintly as the tall black haired 
woman saw the letter. With unseemly haste she opened it, her eyes 
widening a little as she read the typed page. &quot;Very impressed with your 
work...&quot; she read from it aloud, &quot;will send contract?! They&#39;re 
publishing my story!&quot;

&quot;What story?&quot; Ema Maeda asked as the younger, brown haired girl passed 
by, the open door having carried Motoko&#39;s voice out into the hall.

Motoko blushed redly, &quot;I submitted a short story I wrote to a small 
publisher, they want to include it in their magazine.&quot;

&quot;Congradulations!&quot; Ema beamed.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Motoko managed to smile, still blushing furiously.

Noting her friend&#39;s embarrassment Ema asked, &quot;Do you want me to keep it 
a secret?&quot;

Motoko smiled a bit sheepishly, &quot;Could you? I&#39;m still getting used to 
the whole idea of being published...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Ema said as she hugged her pet lizard close, &quot;Leon and I 
can keep a secret.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Motoko chuckled as both girl and lizard headed off.

Upstairs two figures snuggled close together, laying in a tangle of 
sheets on the futon. &quot;Utena,&quot; Anthy murmured as the dusky skinned girl 
looked over at her fondly, &quot;it&#39;s time to get up.&quot;

&quot;Do we have to?&quot; Utena asked softly.

Anthy kissed her softly. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;but we both have to work.&quot;

&quot;Augh,&quot; Utena made a regretful sound as she got up, her short pink hair 
standing up oddly as she stretched.

&quot;Get some clothes on,&quot; Anthy&#39;s voice became husky as she looked at her 
pale lover, &quot;or I won&#39;t be responsible for my actions.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t stop you,&quot; Utena winked as she picked up her shirt and 
pulled it on.

&quot;Tease,&quot; Anthy laughed warmly as she got up and wrapped her arms around 
Utena from behind. She rested her head on Utena&#39;s shoulder as she added 
softly, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Utena turned a bit as she looked down at Anthy, &quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;Forgiving me,&quot; Anthy said, burrying her face against Utena&#39;s neck. &quot;The 
things I did...,&quot; she murmured, her voice muffled.

&quot;Anthy,&quot; Utena eased a arm around her comfortingly, &quot;you thought that 
was the only choice you could make. It wasn&#39;t your fault he lied to 
you...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re too kind, Utena,&quot; Anthy said as she looked up at her tenderly.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Utena answered seriously, &quot;it makes forgiving easier.&quot;

Listening with a mildly disgusted look Koalla Su put the small device 
away as she sighed, &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have a repeat of last night&#39;s 
fun.&quot;

&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t be listening to them,&quot; Shinobu said 
disapprovingly, the black haired girl also blushing furiously. Despite 
having a crush on Motoko she was still not used o the idea of two women 
in love like Utena and Anthy were...

&quot;How else are we supposed to learn things?&quot; Su shrugged casually, 
clearly not very bothered by the idea that spying was wrong.

Deciding it was best not to pursue the argument Shinobu mused, &quot;It&#39;s 
nearly time for lunch, I&#39;d better get to it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Su grinned, &quot;after what they did last night they&#39;ll need to 
regain their strength!&quot;

Shinobu blushed brighter, &quot;Su!&quot;

Hurrying downstairs to the kitchen Shinobu shook her head in dismay. 
Sometimes she really didn&#39;t understand her friend Su, especially her 
attitudes around privacy. As far as she could tell Su didn&#39;t care about 
her own privacy, therefore she didn&#39;t understand other people worrying 
about their privacy.

&quot;Hello, Shinobu,&quot; Rei Hino nodded as she left the front living room, the 
black haired priestess in casual shorts and a loose white blouse.

&quot;Hi Rei,&quot; Shinobu smiled as she bustled about making soup.

Rei Hino smiled to herself, glad to see the girl looking less stiff than 
she once had. While her and Ami living together had generally been 
accepted without too many problem there was a degree of nervousness 
still lingering.

&quot;Where&#39;s Mizuno-senpai?&quot; Shinobu asked curiously.

&quot;Upstairs studying for a quiz,&quot; Rei revealed, &quot;we got tipped off about 
it by a assistant teacher.&quot; She looked a bit pleadingly at Shinobu as 
she asked, &quot;I was hoping I could bring some lunch up to her?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make you a tray,&quot; Shinobu promised as she finished up the 
preparations. Not long afterwards she had a tray set up with soup, rice 
and crackers too, all ready to go.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei said with a grin, &quot;now I just have to pry Ami away from 
her textbook long enough to eat.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Shinobu waved as she walked off.

&quot;Excuse us,&quot; Utena called as she and Anthy hurried in, both looking 
rather scruffy in night shirts and pants.

&quot;Slept in?&quot; Shinobu asked, unable to resist teasing the happy couple.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Utena blushed faintly.

&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot; Anthy offered to Shinobu politely.

&quot;No, no,&quot; Shinobu answered quickly, &quot;everything&#39;s fine.&quot; One of the 
things the Hinata house residents had learned was that Anthy was truly 
frightening in the kitchen. It wasn&#39;t just that she was a bad cook, she 
had a seeming gift for cooking disasters including fire, flood and 
randomly exploding curry.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Utena smiled as she was served her soup.

Tennyo Masaki came in dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, looking healthy 
with her muscles and faint tan. &quot;Yard&#39;s been swept,&quot; she reported, 
&quot;anything else?&quot;

&quot;You sure you want more to do?&quot; Shinobu asked as she poured some soup 
for her as well.

&quot;I&#39;ve been doing a lot of office trips and not doing chores,&quot; Tennyo 
took the soup thankfully, &quot;I want to do my share.&quot;

Anthy paused in spooning up her soup, &quot;I think Mutsumi mentioned she 
could use a hand cleaning up around the caf&eacute;.&quot;:

&quot;Mutsumi, huh?&quot; a faint blush colored Tennyo&#39;s cheeks, &quot;I think I&#39;ll see 
if she still needs help then.&quot;

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Shinobu said, hiding a smile.
