<h1>Hana no Nai Bara (part 5 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krei.html">Kouketsuno Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/hananai-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Himemiya Anthy waited out her school agenda and slowly made her way 
back to her dorm room, a shadow of anguish hovering around her. It had 
already been nearly a week since the tragic duel that stole her away 
from her beloved Utena and the loneliness and neglected love was 
turning the young Bride into a contagious case of depression. The 
feeling of withdrawal from her only love was tearing her apart, like 
so many pieces of her life had. 

&quot;Utena...sama...I wish I could see you again. This whole thing is so 
hard. I can only wonder if you&#146;re all right.&quot; The Bride looked down as 
she walked, watching her feet move with her step. A lost feeling 
struck her once more...the one where she thought back to when she and 
Utena walked home before they had confessed their love for one 
another. They&#146;d talk, Utena would joke around and playfully tease her, 
and sometimes, they&#146;d just hold hands after a bad day. &quot;Such simple 
things make me miss her so much. She really...loved...me.&quot; The 
Observation Tower came into sight and Anthy sighed. Time to return 
home and be played with like the doll she thought of herself as. Each 
step she took seemed to make the distance further, so she looked back 
down. When will she be happy again? When will she be able to be held 
lovingly in the arms of her prince? When...did she fall to the ground?

&quot;Ah...excuse me. I wasn&#146;t...&quot; 

&quot;Hi...Himemiya...I&#146;m sorry.&quot; The Bride closed her mouth quickly and 
slowly looked at a familiar pair of black and white shoes that covered 
a pair of red socks. It couldn&#146;t be.

&quot;...Utena...sa...n.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#146;t see you.&quot; An ivory hand reached out in front of the girl. As 
she took it, she was lifted to her feet when her eyes met the Prince&#146;s 
backside. What was she doing? Without looking back, the Prince&#146;s arm 
lifted at her side and offered Anthy her bag.

&quot;Yes. Again, sorry &#145;bout that.&quot; Utena said again. &quot;Anyway...I better 
go. Later, Himemiya.&quot; The girl began to walk away, but was stopped 
when a silken touch pulled at her wrist.

&quot;Wa... wait, Utena-san...please?&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Why are you leaving so...suddenly? It&#146;s been a week. Aren&#146;t you 
even...going to tell me if you&#146;re okay?&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry...Himemiya. I&#146;m fine. Just some cuts and 
bruises...and...yeah.&quot; 

&quot;Please. Utena. Look at me.&quot; The Prince dropped her head, a sigh 
escaping her lips. Could she really do that? Desperately searching for 
a reason to leave, Utena&#146;s slender fingers traced slowly over her 
scar. Another sigh left her lips as she gave up and spoke.

&quot;Fine...but...please know that nothing that&#146;s happened is your fault.&quot; 
With her head still bowed and her eyes closed, she turned and slowly 
raised her gaze to Anthy&#146;s, eyes opening as she did. 

&quot;...ah...&quot; There it was. The silence. What more could be said? 

&quot;Himemiya...it&#146;s...no big deal. It&#146;s...just a scar.&quot;

&quot;Is it? Is that all it is? You got it because of me!&quot; The Bride raised 
her voice, something she rarely ever did. &quot;...because of...me.&quot; 
Anthy&#146;s head turned shamefully at the remark and Utena just sighed.

&quot;Himemiya...I told you already...none of this is your fault. As the 
Victor, I had to accept the challenge or I would have lost you anyway. 
You have to take risks in the &#39;game&#39; of Revolution...and when you&#146;re 
in love...&quot;

&quot;You told me you&#146;d be all right!&quot; Anthy cut her off.

&quot;I am! Look at me! I&#146;m walking, talking, and I&#146;m here, now! I&#146;m just 
fine.&quot; Anthy&#146;s guilt still surpassed her mild relief. This burdened 
young girl paid no mind to the injuries of her past Victors, but this 
one...this one was different. This one fought for the protection of 
their love, not for the power of World Revolution, even though it came 
with the victory.

&quot;Yes, that&#146;s a relief, but because of me, your...your beautiful face 
is...scarred. I&#146;ll never be able to forgive myself.&quot;

&quot;I know I&#146;m scarred, but that&#146;s not your fault. I had to take a risk 
and with risks you sometimes get hurt.&quot; The Prince sighed in 
frustration. &quot;I knew this would happen. I knew you&#146;d just blame 
yourself no matter what I said. That&#146;s why I&#146;ve...decided I shouldn&#146;t 
duel anymore. Without you around...you won&#146;t live what&#146;s left of your 
life blaming yourself for my strife.&quot; Anthy released the hand she had 
taken earlier and shook her head, her eyes gazing wide at the would-be 
Victor.

&quot;You&#146;re...lying. You wouldn&#146;t give up! No! Utena-sama, please!&quot;

&quot;Himemiya...you have to understand. If I stay with you...you&#146;ll blame 
yourself everyday, every hour, every minute, every second you see my 
face. I know you. I can&#146;t live with that. It would hurt me more than 
you know seeing that.&quot; Himemiya Anthy turned suddenly, her emerald 
eyes glistening with fresh tears. 

&quot;You. You&#146;re just like the rest of the Victors...a quitter. Take a 
loss and you quit.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m not quitting! I&#146;m doing this for your sake! Seeing you belittle 
yourself drives a dagger through me and I hate it! I hate seeing you 
hate yourself!&quot; Utena&#146;s voice rose with frustration and anger. Why 
couldn&#146;t her love understand? It seemed so simple to figure out, yet 
Himemiya Anthy was seeing this differently, and perhaps more 
effectively, than Tenjou Utena was. &quot;You&#146;re too young to be full of 
such remorse and pain.&quot; Anthy was letting it sink in, but wouldn&#146;t 
allow it to register. She knew Utena was scared. The Bride could feel 
the fear emanating from her prince.

&quot;I see. Utena-sama...please...just admit you&#146;re afraid of failure. I 
can sense your fear and it&#146;s a heavy burden.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m...not.&quot; Utena felt she had no reason to pride herself, but she 
did pride Anthy. &quot;I&#146;m...not afraid of failure...for myself. I...fear 
it for you. I fail...and you suffer. Just move on.&quot; Himemiya&#146;s face 
shifted slightly, a realization striking her dramatically.

&quot;Tenjou Utena. Listen to yourself. You strive so hard to... &#145;free&#146; me 
and allow me to live a life for myself. Well, here you are speaking of 
how your failure affects me. What about you? Why doesn&#146;t it affect 
you?&quot; The Prince&#146;s eyes widened to their capacity. Her princess was 
right...but Utena wouldn&#146;t admit it.

&quot;Be...because I want to be the prince. My...princess comes first.&quot; 
Anthy turned back to the former Victor and shook her head before 
embracing her.

&quot;Your well-being should come first. Not me.&quot; Utena smiled some-what 
and put her black-clad arms around the Bride, the smile becoming a 
smirk.

&quot;Well, then, Himemiya...why not practice what you preach, hm?&quot; The 
Hanayome gasped lightly and her cheeks colored. 

&quot;What? That&#146;s not what I meant at all!&quot;

&quot;Himemiya...I&#146;ve been trying to get something like that through your 
head for so long I can&#146;t even remember how long ago it was.&quot; Anthy 
looked down, away from her prince&#146;s piercing, yet heartfelt glare.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Me...too.&quot; Once again, the &#145;exiled&#146; prince and her fated princess 
embraced. They held one another for countless minutes...until Anthy 
felt a dreaded longing and quickly pulled the prince&#146;s head down, 
kissing her as if she&#146;d been deprived of precious air. No one was 
around, so Anthy had made her move, though rather foolishly.

&quot;What the hell do you think your doing with my Bride!?&quot; Utena&#146;s face 
faltered as she pulled her lips away from Anthy&#146;s quickly.

&quot;What do you want, you pathetic cheat?&quot; Shintaro Keingo, the new 
Victor, stepped to the two girls, placing his hands on either girls&#146; 
shoulder. A smirk played onto his features, making the pink-headed 
prince want to gag. 

&quot;What I want is for you to take your hands of my Bride before I force 
them off.&quot; Utena was not amused to say the least. In fact, as soon as 
he finished talking, the boy&#146;s hand on Anthy&#146;s shoulder pushed 
harshly, throwing the girl to the ground.

&quot;I didn&#146;t even get a chance to comply.&quot; The prince spoke 
sarcastically. &quot;Why don&#146;t we try again...without you screwing 
everything up by BEING a screw-up.&quot; Tenjou Utena knew her adoption of 
a sharp tongue was only going to get her into further trouble, but she 
had to risk it...for Himemiya. A sharp crack of stricken flesh rang in 
Anthy&#146;s ears as her prince&#146;s carnation-tinted head whipped to the side 
with a violent jerk of the neck. &quot;You get off on striking girls...or 
is it just a bad habit?&quot; The boy, enraged, struck her again. With 
heated-pain in both her cheeks, the prince took her place...next to 
Anthy. 

&quot;Hiding behind a puppet, Tenjou-kun? Don&#146;t you have any damn pride!?&quot;

&quot;Why? I don&#146;t require the need to become you. &#145;Arrogance&#146; isn&#146;t a word 
I require any use in.&quot; Utena took the Bride by the hand and began to 
lead her away. Shintaro wasn&#146;t done. Not by a long shot. Quicker than 
Utena could react, he side-stepped her, raised his hand, balled it 
into a fist, and swung it. 

&quot;Himemiya!!&quot; The shocked Prince quickly knelt down by her love, taking 
the Bride&#146;s chin in her fingertips and examining the now developing 
bruise that was spreading on her cheekbone, a tiny trickle of blood in 
the corner of her mouth, probably from biting her lip on impact. 
&quot;....bastard. You bastard!! How dare you strike her! And with a fist!? 
You&#146;re lower than anything I can imagine.&quot;

&quot;Strike a nerve, Tenjou-kun? Well, you gonna avenge her? Show me what 
you got. Right here...not in some traditional dueling arena.&quot; Keingo 
shook his fist in the air, glaring sadistically at Utena. &quot;You run 
with the big boys...? You play by our rules.&quot; Utena stood, anger the 
only feature on her face. What the hell was she thinking? 

&quot;Utena-san! Don&#146;t! That&#146;s just what he wants you to do!&quot; The Bride 
cried, but Utena silenced her.

&quot;Shintaro Keingo....I have no burning desire to fight you. Our fight 
lies within the arena...whether you like it...or not.&quot; She turned 
away. &quot;Let&#146;s be mature about this...hmm?&quot; ...and she walked away.

&quot;You&#146;ll never be a prince!!&quot; Keingo&#146;s forced weight on Utena&#146;s back 
brought both of them to the ground in a heap, the angered boy throwing 
punches left and right at the girl below him. 

&quot;Stop it, Shintaro-sama!! Please!!&quot; The Bara no Hanayome jumped in to 
intercept, but was once again swatted away like a small pest. Utena, 
though, took the opportunity to kick her leg up and throw the 
distracted Victor over her head. Both stood quickly, and fell just as 
fast, as Shintaro threw himself into her once more. They landed hard 
in a scuffle and grasped one another tightly in rage as they rolled 
down a nearby hill. Once more, Keingo was thrown head-over-heels. 
Utena stood up and ran to him, her rage of seeing Anthy abused taking 
over her composure. With a leap, she landed on his chest, straddling 
it and throwing her own punches into his open face. Left, right, left, 
right...a cry of pain escaping the vulnerable boy, especially when the 
prince&#146;s ringed hand hit him. Ringed...hand? 

&quot;I&#146;ll never forgive you!! Striking a young girl, cheating in the game 
of Revolution, humiliating her and me, taking advantage of your 
powers!! You will not take us for granted, ever again!!&quot; Utena 
screamed in bloody outrage and she delivered blow after blow, in an 
unrecognizable manner of the girl. By this time, Anthy made it down 
the hill and ran to the two, taking Utena around the waist and 
desperately pulling with all her being to pry the prince from the 
bloodied Shintaro.

&quot;Utena-san, no, Stop it, please!!&quot; And stop she did. The winded girl 
allowed herself to be pulled away, her hair a mess, her jacket 
stretched and torn on her body, her nose and mouth bled. &quot;It&#146;s over, 
Utena-san...it&#146;s over.&quot; A familiar shock spread into the ex-Victor&#146;s 
cobalt eyes. What had she done!? A councilman...this boy was a 
councilman. Oh, she was in trouble if this got out.

&quot;They&#146;re down there!! I saw them, Seitokaichou!! They were fighting!&quot; 
A young girl&#146;s voice could be heard from atop the hill speaking to 
none other than Kiryuu Touga. Utena&#146;s heart sank...she knew she was 
cold busted. Resting in front of Anthy, who still had her arms around 
her prince&#146;s waist, Utena watched without purpose as Touga came down 
the steep hill, his sister, Nanami, trailing behind him, as usual, and 
the obvious narc behind her. A smirk spread on his face when Keingo 
sat up, wiping the blood off his face with his sleeve, as Touga 
approached his opponent.

&quot;Tenjou Utena...you&#146;re responsible for this?&quot; The Seitokaichou spoke 
after a moment. &quot;Assaulting a member of the Student Council? That, 
Tenjou Utena, is a highly punishable offense in this school. What have 
you to say on your behalf?&quot; The strawberry-haired Prince stood, 
looking expressionlessly at the speaker. 

&quot;What is there to say? Shintaro Keingo picked a fight with me. I&#146;m not 
exactly going to let him attack me without defense. Though, why am I 
telling you this? Knowing him, he&#146;ll just make up some 
easily-believable story to defend himself with and this whole incident 
will be my fault.&quot; Utena said with obvious annoyance. &quot;No one, 
especially the Seitokai, will listen to my side of this and believe 
it. So, punish me now and get it over with.&quot; The girl spoke with 
unintentional sarcasm, but with belief of her views. &quot;How bad can it 
be?&quot; She thought. Funny she should ask...

&quot;I see. Shintaro Keingo...what have you to say?&quot;

&quot;I shouldn&#146;t have to say anything. I fought for my honor. She insulted 
me by trying to walk away with my Rose Bride. What should I have done? 
So, I jumped her to take back what&#146;s mine.&quot; 

&quot;True, but fighting is not tolerable. In reality, you, too, are 
responsible for this, but in terms of each party&#146;s story, the blame is 
mostly riding...on Tenjou Utena.&quot; With that verdict from the 
President, Utena stood and prepared to accept her punishment.

&quot;All right. I did try to walk off with Himemiya...but...&quot; What? This 
can&#146;t be! Shintaro Keingo...lied and told the truth at the same time!! 
&quot;What&#146;s my penalty? A stupid detention?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...if this had been a fight between normal students...but you 
two are both involved with the game of Revolution. Therefore, Tenjou 
Utena, you are to be temporarily suspended from Dueling. Surrender 
your ring for the time being.&quot; 

&quot;What!? You can&#146;t do that!! What about him!? He&#146;s in this as deep as I 
am!! Why does he still get to duel!?&quot;

&quot;I cannot suspend the Kettou no Shioushia...that would be pointless.&quot;

&quot;Pointless!? What&#146;s pointless about being fair!? He attacked me, too!&quot;

&quot;True, but your faults are deeper in depth than his. Now, I&#146;m asking 
you again, surrender your ring or face permanent expulsion by order of 
the Rijichou.&quot; Utena&#146;s face was blank, yet hints of shock were 
noticeable. The Dean wouldn&#39;t expel her...would he? She wouldn&#39;t risk 
it. From behind Touga, Keingo could be seen snickering, only further 
angering the prince. From a distance, Himemiya Anthy was as equally 
shocked. Utena wasn&#146;t surrendering her ring willingly? Was this 
because she really didn&#146;t mean what she&#146;d said about not dueling 
anymore? On the other hand, she had no say in anything...as the Rose 
Bride.

&quot;I can&#146;t believe this is happening to me.&quot; Utena thought sadly. She 
lifted her arm, wiping away the blood from her nose and mouth, then 
raised her other arm and began to uselessly wipe her tears away before 
she looked up to the President. 

&quot;The ring, Tenjou-kun! We ain&#146;t got all day. Just go back to being a 
little girl who gets rescued by her childish dreams.&quot;

&quot;Silence yourself, Shintaro. This doesn&#146;t concern you.&quot; So it was 
finalized, she really couldn&#146;t duel...even if she wanted to. Utena 
placed her hand into her pocket and slid the ring around her finger 
with hesitation, then, defeated by truth, she pulled it back out and 
held it before Touga. Slowly, he reached out, took Utena&#146;s hand in 
his, and used his other to remove the Rose Signet and pocket it.

&quot;Two weeks, Tenjou Utena...and you will be eligible to duel once 
more.&quot; The words entered one ear and half exited the other. Two 
weeks!? How much more could she take? In angered sorrow, Utena turned 
and ran to Anthy, knelt by her and kissed her deeply before she pulled 
away and said softly...

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, Himemiya...I&#146;m sorry. I lied to you. Forgive me.&quot; And with 
that, Tenjou Utena turned on both heels and ran as fast as she could 
to get away...to get away from everything. In her mind&#146;s eye, she 
could only hear the humiliating voices of the people she ran from, 
laughing cruelly at her punishments and torture. Like a weakened 
prisoner, hanging by the wrists after an intentional public punishment 
for her sins, all she heard was degrading laughter of her pain. Touga 
raising the switch once more and striking his prisoner upon her bare 
back, a pained and shamed cry ringing throughout the heavens, and then 
the howling and sadistic laughter of the numerous faces of Shintaro 
Keingo, Kiryuu Nanami, and Himemiya Anthy all pointing to, and 
verbally mocking her.

 

&quot;Tenjou Utena is a make-believe Prince.&quot;

&quot;Hot-headed, Tenjou-kun!&quot;

&quot;Baka, Utena-chan!!&quot;

&quot;She&#146;ll never become a real Prince.&quot;

&quot;So, Tenjou Utena is human after all...&quot;

&quot;Go back to being a little girl, to being rescued by childish dreams.&quot;

These, and other painful remarks, tore through the &#145;make-believe&#146; 
Prince&#146;s being. How can one become a noble and heroic prince, if they 
can&#146;t control their own emotional outbursts? Never looking back, 
Tenjou Utena just ran. Where? Her quiet, unkempt, and lonely dorm 
room. Through the door she ran, slamming it shut, and locking herself 
in.

&quot;...a little girl with childish dreams...&quot; She leaned against the 
door, letting a few tears find their way down her streaked face, as 
she touched her fingertips to her lips. &quot;...is that what I am?&quot; Then 
she thought of what she had just done. &quot;Himemiya...I&#146;m a failure. I 
didn&#146;t listen to you...and I didn&#146;t listen to Dios-sama. That makes me 
self-centered and foolish. I can&#146;t let you see me like that.&quot; She 
pressed her lips to her fingertips briefly and stood, exhausted 
though, from the fight, the running, the shouting, the crying, the 
everything! The &#145;little girl&#146; stepped over her unpacked bags and boxes 
and threw herself into her bed, where she emotionally broke down in a 
flood of defeated cries and choked sobs. &quot;...what have I done...? 
...oh, Himemiya...I&#146;m so sorry. &quot;

 

 

&quot;You what!?&quot; Arisugawa Juri bolted from her seat, slamming her hands 
onto the table in shock. &quot;How could you do that!?&quot; 

&quot;I did. It seems that Tenjou Utena just...needed to be released for a 
short while.&quot; The Seitokai meeting wasn&#146;t exactly going too well to 
some extent. Touga had informed them of his decision to suspend Utena 
from dueling as punishment for her offense.

&quot;How the hell do you know she wasn&#146;t telling the truth? What reason 
would Tenjou-san have to lie?&quot; The Seitokai representative seated 
herself, though still, visibly outraged.

&quot;I never said she had lied in the first place. The Rijichou had 
informed me of Shintaro-san&#146;s past troubles in school and it wouldn&#146;t 
surprise me in the least if he had been responsible. That is why I 
suspended her.&quot;

&quot;That makes no damn sense! He lies and Utena gets punished!?&quot;

&quot;The Rijichou doesn&#146;t want, under any circumstance, to lose this boy. 
Why, I don&#146;t know, but I&#146;m not going to argue.&quot; 

&quot;I still think your decision was rather shortly thought out.&quot; Juri 
turned her head toward the infamous Seitokai member and glared. 
&quot;Shintaro Keingo. If it were left up to me, I&#146;d see you surrender your 
title as Kettou no Shioushia to Tenjou Utena and beg not to suffer at 
her hand.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#146;s not, so mind your own business, sempai.&quot; He responded, 
mocking Utena&#146;s use of the word &#145;sempai&#146; that she used toward Juri. 

&quot;It is apparent that you mistreat the Bara no Hanayome, but you also 
mistreat a Victor? Where in this world is your honor?&quot; The fencing 
captain turned and walked away into the elevator and disappeared from 
sight. 

&quot;My honor? Akio-san is my honor.&quot; He muttered to himself.

Shinohara Wakaba sat underneath the usual tree she and Utena always 
met, a bento resting in her lap. Once again, she spent the school day 
by herself, thinking about her best friend. What happened to her poor 
Utena? Slowly, she unwrapped the small bento and gazed at the food 
that she made for herself...the same food she often made for Utena. 

&quot;...ahhh...Utena-sama, what happened to you? School&#146;s no fun without 
the old you. Why&#146;d you change?&quot; She picked up a mouthful in her little 
green chopsticks and proceeded to eat. 

&quot;Hello, Shinohara-san.&quot; 

&quot;Wha? Ah! Hello, Himemiya-san.&quot; Wakaba smiled as she spoke through a 
mouthful of food. &quot;No offense, but how come you&#146;re sitting here with 
me?&quot;

&quot;I just...wanted to thank you for what you did the other day in the 
halls. I realize that Shintaro-sama was a little rough with you. Are 
you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m okay. Don&#146;t think anything of it. I&#146;m not exactly sure what came 
over me, but I do know that anything Utena-sama sees wrong, I do, 
too.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Have...you seen her, Utena-san, recently?&quot;

&quot;No, unfortunately I haven&#146;t. She...didn&#146;t come to school today.&quot;

&quot;She didn&#146;t?&quot; The Bride&#146;s eyes downcast at Wakaba&#146;s answer. &quot;...oh 
no...&quot; For some time, Anthy said nothing until the smaller girl waved 
her hand in her face.

&quot;You still with me? I think I lost ya...&quot; 

&quot;Oh, sorry about...I&#146;m just thinking is all.&quot; The Hanayome smiled 
slightly at how much Wakaba&#146;s carefree lifestyle reminded her of 
Utena&#146;s. An unforgettable personality. 

&quot;You were thinking of Utena-sama, weren&#146;t you? I know that look. I 
used to get it all the time when I wanted to be her steady.&quot; By now, 
Anthy was blushing a little. This cheerful little child could even 
read emotions like Utena. &quot;Himemiya-san? Can...I ask you 
something...kind of important?&quot;

&quot;Oh...sure. What is it?&quot;

&quot;Why did you make Utena-sama sad?&quot;

&quot;Wha?? I don&#146;t understand what you mean?&quot; Where did that come from? 
The question shocked Anthy quite undeniably.

&quot;The way I see it, you two had...well...a good relationship. How come 
you just went away from her for that guy who, you know, beat her up?&quot;

&quot;Shinohara...san...I didn&#146;t want to. I didn&#146;t. Demo...I hadn&#146;t a 
choice.&quot;

&quot;A choice? Of course you did! Everyone has a choice.&quot; It was only now 
that Anthy realized that Wakaba knew nothing of the game of 
Revolution. Now, was a good a time as any.

&quot;Shinohara Wakaba...will you come with me? I think...you need to know 
something about Utena-san...that she would never tell you directly.&quot;

&quot;Huh? You have to be kidding...Utena-sama tells me everything!&quot;

&quot;Not this...she couldn&#146;t. For telling you...she could have been 
expelled.&quot;

&quot;What is she, an ex-con or something? Gimmie a break! It can&#146;t be that 
bad.&quot; The Bride released a sigh and stood up, offering her dark hand 
to her love&#146;s best friend.

&quot;Please...this isn&#146;t a joke. It&#146;s quite serious...and it may answer 
some of your lingering questions.&quot; Defeated, Wakaba stood up and 
followed Anthy through the campus into the student-forbidden Kettou 
Hiroba no Mori.

&quot;Wa...wait a sec, Himemiya-san! We aren&#146;t...allowed in there.&quot; 

&quot;Trust me.&quot; 

&quot;Ummm...all right, but if I get in trouble...&quot; The two entered the 
wooded area and walked quietly through it until they came to a huge 
gate, sculpted to look like a rose: the Bara no Mon. 

&quot;This...is the door to Utena-san&#146;s greatest secret.&quot; Anthy, being the 
Bara no Hanayome, took the single trigger in her hand and the gate 
began to part. &quot;Come with me, Shinohara-san.&quot; The water began to flow 
all around them as the Bara no Mon fully opened and the two walked 
through the thresh-hold. Wakaba&#146;s eyes widened to their capacity as 
she laid them on the Kettou Hiroba no Rasenkaidan. 

&quot;Wha...what is this? It&#146;s so high! How come...you can&#146;t see it 
outside?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s merely an optical illusion from the outside world.&quot; The 
mysterious girl spoke as she and her follower entered the cage-like 
&#145;elevator&#146; and began climbing the length of the swirling stairway. 

&quot;This is incredible!&quot; Excited as always, Wakaba watched the ground 
below them get smaller and further away until it became invisible. 
With a soft jerk, the cage stopped and they exited into the Kettou 
Hiroba. It&#146;s wide, spacious architecture was nothing compared to the 
majestic castle that hovered, up-side-down, over their heads: the 
Maboroshi no Shirou. Wakaba was simply awe-struck. &quot;It&#146;s so beautiful! 
How can this be so bad?&quot; The girl turned her head to find Anthy not 
there. &quot;Ah! Hey! Himemiya-san!&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s all right...I&#146;m still here.&quot; Wakaba turned once more and her 
gaze locked on a dark-skinned girl in a long, flowing red dress that 
stood before her. 

&quot;...Himemiya-san? Wh...what&#146;s going on here?&quot;

&quot;Once, there was a young girl who was being mistreated by the man 
everyone thought to be her boyfriend. A mere lovers&#146; quarrel was how 
most saw it. When this man struck the girl&#146;s face, an innocent 
bystander became enraged, but did nothing right away. Later, that same 
day, the bystander&#146;s friend was emotionally hurt by the man. To avenge 
her friend&#146;s honor, the young, brave bystander approached the man and 
challenged him. By mistake, he assumed the bystander to be someone she 
was not and requested to meet her in a traditional duel. She accepted 
and met as told, surprised to see the mistreated young girl present 
there as well. The man explained to the challenger that this girl he 
had slapped earlier was not his girlfriend, but his Bride. The &#145;prize&#146; 
awarded to the Victor of the Duel. The challenger was angered to see 
the Bride being treated so badly and then proceeded to duel with the 
Victor. Miraculously, she defeated him with a split bo-ken and became 
the Kettou no Shioushia, therefore becoming &#145;engaged&#146; to the Bara no 
Hanayome.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t understand. How did the challenger get into the fight by 
mistake?&quot;

&quot;The man saw her Bara no Kokuin. Only those who are allowed to 
participate in the game of Revolution wear this signet. The 
challenger, though, did not understand what she had gotten into. She 
believed her signet was an engagement ring given to her by a prince on 
a white horse.&quot;

&quot;So...she became...the Kettou no Shioushia...by accident?&quot;

&quot;Technically. And with that, she was given Dios no Chikara and that 
would be used to revolutionize the world.&quot;

&quot;...and she wasn&#146;t allowed to tell those who didn&#146;t possess the Bara 
no Kokuin?&quot;

&quot;Exactly.&quot;

&quot;I see. Utena-sama...was fighting with Saionji-sempai...because of how 
he treated me. He mistook her for a &#145;duelist&#146; and she got into a fight 
she knew nothing of. She won and she...became the Victor.&quot;

&quot;Yes. And I became her Bara no Hanayome. As Victor, she could not turn 
down a challenge from anyone or else she&#146;d have to forfeit.&quot; 

&quot;It&#146;s very complicated, but I get the basics. I take it she got 
challenged and lost, then.&quot;

&quot;Yes. That is why things are the way they&#146;ve been.&quot; The Bride lowered 
her head and sighed. Finally, it took awhile, but she explained the 
secret to Wakaba as briefly as possible. &quot;Utena-san claimed he cheated 
in that duel, but I couldn&#146;t argue with the Sekai no Hate&#146;s call on 
the result of the duel.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll bet he did cheat. He cheated at the basketball game that one 
day, so he may have cheated at the duel, too.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps, but there is nothing that can be done, now.&quot;

&quot;How come? Why doesn&#146;t Utena-sama challenge Shintaro and take you 
back!?&quot; Wakaba&#146;s voice began to rise with anxiety as the realization 
hit her, hard.

&quot;She can&#146;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not!? She&#146;s a duelist isn&#146;t she?&quot;

&quot;She is, but she was suspended from dueling yesterday, by the 
Seitokaichou, for fighting. Even though I witnessed his harassment to 
her, I could do nothing because I am his Bride and I have to obey him 
no matter what.&quot;

&quot;Suspended!? Oh, no! That&#146;s why she was gone today!&quot; Wakaba turned to 
run back to the cage-like &#145;elevator&#146;. &quot;Himemiya-san...Bara no 
Hanayome...please, come with me!&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry...but I cannot. My Victor has forbidden me to see 
Utena-san. I have no choice but to comply.&quot; A tint of anger glistened 
in Wakaba&#146;s eye as she turned away and entered the elevator.

&quot;Get a backbone, Himemiya-san. Utena-sama needs you. She has nobody 
right now, so, go to her and be a somebody.&quot; Then, she disappeared as 
the elevator lowered back to the Earth below.
