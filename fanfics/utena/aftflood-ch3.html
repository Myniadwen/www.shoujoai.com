--------------------------------------------------

 In the twilight of dawn she was pacing up and down the 
room, trying to think of a way to solve this. To solve 
this condition, this lack of something that was gnawing 
away at her. For a hundredth time she made the eleven 
steps plus a half one up and down the room stopping to try 
to think everything over again.

 She looked around the room, feeling so sick of it she 
couldn&#39;t even think straight. The wallpapers were so 
disgusting they made her sick. The rising sun in the east 
reminded her she had to leave this place or she&#39;ll go mad 
and trash another room.

 It had been three months since she left Ohtori and this 
was the third or fourth town she was about to leave. She 
couldn&#39;t stand it here another day.

 Her gaze stopped on her suitcase under the bed. She 
sighed in resignation, took it out and began packing. She 
calmed down as she had something to keep herself busy 
with, if just for a few minutes. So she took her time. To 
her it became a ritual. First hotel room towels and soaps. 
Then her underwear, pajamas, casual clothes and the 
picture on top. Dressed in her most decent clothes she 
checked the room one last time and left it.

 &quot;Ah, Miss Tenjou! You are leaving us already,&quot; the clerk 
asked in trained politeness.

 &quot;Yes,&quot; she answered annoyed. She hated those kinds of 
questions and that kind of attitude. &quot;Could you tell me 
please what&#39;s the next bigger town southward along the 
coast?&quot; she asked, as always. She tried to leave a trail 
behind her even though her hopes about someone coming to 
look for her were diminishing day by day.

 She made her way to the train station and went for the 
next town, the next hotel, maybe get a job, maybe not, it 
didn&#39;t really matter. She was trying but waiting for 
something to happen was something she was worst at.

 Anyway, the deadline was moving closer. Six months was 
the deadline she set herself. Six months she would wait, 
then stop, give up all hope and forget everything. Move 
on. She doubted it would go like this but that was the 
plan anyway.
