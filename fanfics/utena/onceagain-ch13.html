<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 13 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/onceagain-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Ema Maeda&#39;s long brown hair fell around the young
woman&#39;s shoulders as she sat outside in the sun and
used her laptop to update her webpage. &#39;News of the
weird&#39; was actually becoming fairly popular,
containing stories she found on the web, her personal
blog and stuff from Kitsune&#39;s ghost busting operation.

&#39;Demons walk among us!&#39; one title screamed. In a
otherwise seemingly normal shrine a mysterious being
was haunting the inhabitants, popping up without
warning. A slim, white haired boy with dog&#39;s ears and
clawed fingers has terrorized the neighborhood, tho
reports of his activities vary. While most say it&#39;s a
monster, several witnesses claim to have been rescused
by the mysterious boy.

Ema smiled in satisfaction as she noted how many hits
that article had gotten. &#39;The blurred photo helps,&#39;
she noted, &#39;though I wish I got a better shot.&#39;

Scrolling down a bit she clicked on another story.
&#39;Sailor Senshi seen in Kanagawa Prefecture! The famous
heroes of love and justice were seen fighting
alongside our own local band of heroes, the Phantom
Quest Corp!&#39;

Ema winced a bit at that blatant ad. Kitsune could be
really forceful, and it didn&#39;t help that she was
paying part of the costs for the site. &#39;Well,&#39; she
mused, &#39;at least I tried to be objective, mostly.&#39;

The article continued, &#39;The Sailor Senshi successfully
defeated the steam creature, primarily assisted by the
sword work of Motoko. Along with Sailor Mars they
banished the creature, generating mild flooding amid
the hot springs shops. A lawsuit is pending against
PQC, but management are confident they will prevail.&#39;

&#39;Motoko-sama,&#39; Ema sighed dreamily. If she was going
to crush on anyone it would be the striking, black
haired swordswoman. Sadly, she didn&#39;t seem to be
inclined that way. &#39;If only Motoko was a boy,&#39; she
thought.

Saving her files Ema closed her laptop and stretched,
the slim girl sighing happily. &quot;Come on Leon,&quot; she
picked up her chameleon and headed inside.

The typical morning bustle of the Hinata Inn was a
little different this morning as a guest followed
Anthy to the kitchen. She was about Anthy&#39;s height
with bright pink hair and laughing blue eyes along
with a gentle but warm smile. Introduced to them as
Utena Tenjou Ema noticed a mysterious aura about her,
a strange feeling of nobility like some long lost
prince.

&quot;Hello Shinobu,&quot; Ema smiled as she walked by the two
older girls, &quot;is there anything I can do to help?&quot;

Shinobu smiled cheerfully, the black haired girl
rinsing the cooked rice. &quot;Everything&#39;s nearly ready,&quot;
she answered, &quot;could you help set the table?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Ema agreed.

Now theoretically they were all supposed to be sharing
kitchen duties... well, except for Anthy as she
couldn&#39;t cook food, period. But Shinobu was so good
and eager to cook that they all just let her do that,
and in return everyone else tackled most of the other
household duties. As Ema and Anthy readied the table
Ema snuck glances at the new woman, wondering what her
story might be.

&quot;So you&#39;re Ema?&quot; Utena asked as she carried cups and
plates over, &quot;Anthy told me a bit about you.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Ema nodded. She smiled as she
added, &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you and Anthy have been
reunited.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena actually blushed faintly.

Within short order the rest of the residents trickled
in, coming in ones or twos to the table. TEnnyo Masaki
entered talking to Mutsumi Otohime, the white haired
woman gesturing animatedly as they went to sit.
Kitsune staggered in, probably hung over, and smiled
greatfully as Ema poured her some tea.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitsune admitted as she sat down, her short
brown hair spiky from how she had been sleeping.

Kanako Urashima stalked in, the girl dressed all in
black at usual. She had a intensity that could be off
putting, but Ema had been pleasantly surprised by her
humor. The black cat perched on her shoulder looked at
Ema&#39;s Leon and purred, &quot;Hmm, food on the hoof.&quot;

Ema jumped a bit. Now, according to rational thinking
the cat couldn&#39;t talk, and therefore must be just
Kanako throwing her voice. But somehow the cat sounded
very different from Kanaki, almost like a separate
person. To be safe she addressed the cat as she
clutched Leon, &quot;Don&#39;t even think about it.&quot;

Kero just snickered softly.

&quot;Myah!&quot; Tama-chan commented as the turtle flapped by.

&quot;Damn turtle,&quot; Motoko visibly shuddered.

&#39;I forget some times that she doesn&#39;t like them,&#39; Ema
noted as she watched Koalla Su easily scoop the turtle
out of midair.

&quot;Can I make Tama soup?&quot; Su asked perkilly, the dusky
skinned blonde looking a bit like a overgrown monkey.

&quot;No,&quot; Shinobu said forcefully, &quot;just put her outside.&quot;

&quot;Interesting place,&quot; Utena commented to Anthy softly
as they settled down.

&quot;I like it,&quot; Anthy nodded as Rei and Ami hurried in.
Rei Hino was dressed in her miko uniform, the red and
white garb suiting the black haired woman, while Ami
Mizuno was in more casual school wear.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Tennyo said, the older woman&#39;s eyes
sympathetic as she addressed Ami, &quot;long night?&quot;

&quot;Studying for a quiz on gastric disease,&quot; Ami
grimaced, &quot;trust me, the less you know the better off
you are.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Kitsune winced.

Kanako said firmly, &quot;No discussion of gastric disease
at the table.&quot; She smiled slightly, letting everyone
know she was joking.

&quot;Breakfast is ready,&quot; Shinobu announced as she
carefully carried the rice in first, then the rest of
the breakfast dishes. With skills that would impress
any mother she dished up the food, humming to herself
cheerfully.

&quot;This is great,&quot; Rei smiled, eating quickly but still
neatly.

Anthy looked over at her, &quot;Heading over to the shrine
today?&quot;

&quot;Actually, Kitsune has a job for us,&quot; Rei noted wryly.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Utena said, looking over at Kitsune as she
nibbled toast.

Kitsune drank some tea, &quot;There&#39;s a haunted house the
owner wants us to look into. I don&#39;t expect serious
trouble, but I want all the bases covered.&quot;

&quot;We do ghost busting,&quot; Anthy explained to her
girlfriend softly, &quot;as a extension on Phantom Quest
Corp.&quot;

Utena nodded thoughtfully as she looked over at
Kitsune, &quot;Do you mind if I tag along?&quot;

Kitsune raised her eyebrows, &quot;Is that safe?&quot;

Utena smiled back, but her eyes were haunted. &quot;I have
certain... talents,&quot; she finally said with a shrug.

Kitsune looked at her a moment then decided just to
accept it. &quot;All right,&quot; she said, &quot;but if anything
goes wrong I&#39;m not responsible.&quot;

&quot;Worried about another lawsuit?&quot; Ema teased.

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Kitsune sighed.</pre>
