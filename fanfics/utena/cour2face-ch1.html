<h1>Courage to Face the Desire</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tamagochan.html">Tamagochan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>When two lovers are destined for each other, rules or obstacles only 
exists as how the lovers perceive them.

Utena slows her usually brisk pace to let the dainty Anthy keep pace 
with her long strides.  They are both keeping good pace that morning as 
they walk along a private path that runs from their dormitory to their 
school.  Utena steals surreptitious glances at Anthy.  She observes the 
soft lavender hue of Anthy&#39;s hair as the sun&#146;s morning ray bounces 
merrily off the rich copious hair while wondering what sort of girl 
Anthy is, to be a willingly participate in the seemingly decadence world 
of the Student Council. 

Utena notes the curve of Anthy&#146;s downcast eyelashes. &quot;What lies 
underneath those demure eyes&#148;, Utena asked herself, &quot;to make her 
agreeable to give herself as a Bride to strangers?&quot; She reflected back 
on the events that had unfolded the past few weeks.  The fated day she 
rescued Anthy from the diabolical mistreatments of Saonji-sempai, when 
Anthy and Chu-chu moved in to her room, her introduction to the members 
of the Student Council and World&#39;s End and the strange rules they abide 
to, particularly the rule where the winner of the duels is allowed to do 
what he or she may to the &quot;Rose Bride&quot;. She got jolted out of her 
thoughts as she accidentally stumbled on an errant pebble.

&quot;Tenjou Utena-sama?&quot; Anthy inquired in her soft voice as she bends ever 
so gracefully to touch Utena&#39;s sleeves. Utena blushed profusedly and 
batted away Anthy&#146;s hand as she recovered from her fall. &quot;Look Anthy, 
you have to stop with this whole Tenjou-sama thing, okay? Call me Utena. 
You won&#39;t like it if I called you Himemiya Anthy-sama now, would you?&quot; 
Utena continues as she sees Anthy about to interject, &quot;And no, do not 
start on me about how you are my bride. It is just not right. We are 
good friends and best of pals but it should not be anything more.&quot; Anthy 
looks forlorn as she bowed her head in apology that Utena felt tempted 
to take back her words.  But straightening with resolve, Utena grabbed 
hold of Anthy&#39;s shoulders and said, &quot;Anthy, we are both girls. You can 
not possible be my bride. By right, we should be dating boys, 
concentrating on exams and homework, participate in healthy normal 
student activities. Not playing some Bride and Groom games devised by 
some perverts in the Student Council or World&#39;s End. Nor should we be 
risking our lives in some silly duel. This struggle for power is 
absolutely silly, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Utena looked directly into Anthy&#39;s 
simmering green eyes and suddenly lost her train of thought. 

One could easy drown in those eyes was the thought that runs through 
Utena&#39;s mind. Shaking her head slightly to clear her mind, Utena pointed 
her gaze everywhere but Anthy&#39;s face and continued, &quot;I know what! I know 
Miki is interested in you. He is cute and smart too. I can set you two 
up on a date. That way you can date someone and get help with homework 
at the same time too!&quot; Utena laughs nervously at Anthy&#39;s serious 
expression. &quot;Won&#39;t you like that? Two birds with one stone! We can start 
leading normal lives and get good grades. Then maybe the Student Council 
will leave us alone, don&#146;t you think? Maybe I can date Touga or your 
brother,&quot; Utena gushes out enthusiastically.  Anthy looks at Utena&#39;s 
earnest face and reach out to tuck a wayward pink lock behind Utena&#39;s 
ear.  Anthy slowly nods. &quot;Yes Tenjou-sama...&quot;

Utena quickly interrupts, &quot;Call me Utena!&quot;

&quot;Yes Tenjou-sa.. Utena, I will like that very much.&quot; Anthy continues.  
Taking Anthy&#39;s little upturned smile as a further sign of agreement, 
Utena breathes a sigh of relief and continues to layout her matchmaking 
plan. So intent and happy was Utena in Anthy&#39;s accord, she did not 
notice the brief flash of pained look on Anthy&#39;s face. 

Utena burst into their private dorm room that night, spots Anthy 
drinking tea at their sitting room table and promptly plops herself down 
next to Anthy. &quot;Guess who is having a romantic date tomorrow night?&quot; 
Utena asked Anthy excitedly. Anthy carefully puts her cup down on the 
saucer and deliberates over her tea with her delicate ornate teaspoon as 
she quietly listens to Utena&#39;s grand plan for her date with Miki. Utena 
quickly jots down an itinerary:

	6.00pm	Mikie to pick Anthy up from the dorm with flowers and 
			chocolates
	7.20pm 	Dinner reservation at Le Bistro du Romance in 
			downtown
	8.45pm	Movie
	10.15pm	Late coffee at Sundough caf&eacute;
	11.00pm	Come Home

&quot;Does this not sound like a grand plan, Anthy?&quot; Utena asks as she 
proudly holds up the sheet of paper to review her handiwork.  Anthy 
stops stirring her tea and gave Utena a tiny smile and nods. &quot;Yes 
Tenjou-sama&quot; Anthy starts to say.  &quot;Utena&quot;, Utena reminds Anthy.  Anthy 
paused, &quot;Yes, Tenjou-sa.. Utena, it sounds like a wonderful idea.&quot; Utena 
gives a vigorous nod and moves to stick the itinerary on their bunk bed.  
She pushes the thumbtack through the sheet of paper with a resolved 
stab. That night, Anthy lays awake, staring blankly at the roof of her 
bed where Utena is snoring softly. 

Next morning, Utena wakes up to the bustle of Anthy doing her daily 
morning chores. She peeks at Anthy from her top loft.  She follows the 
elegant curve of Anthy&#39;s exposed nape to the ponytail that tries to 
curtail Anthy&#39;s abundant mauve hair to the curve of Anthy&#39;s ridiculously 
long eyelashes. Utena&#39;s eyes start to wander the rest of Anthy&#39;s body.  
Miki is going to be one lucky guy, Utena thought. Utena stretches and 
jumps down the bed.  On an impulse, she gave the surprised Anthy a peck 
on the cheeks.  Before Anthy has a chance to react, Utena taps on the 
itinerary and makes her way out to the bathroom. &quot;Don&#146;t forget the big 
date tonight&quot;, Utena says as she closes the door behind her.

The whole day Utena is unable to concentrate on any of her activities. 
The teachers keep catching her with a vacant expression on her face. 
Gosh, Utena thinks to herself, I must really be excited about this date 
for Anthy and Miki since I cannot get it out of my mind. Utena and 
Anthy&#39;s Friday class and activities schedule do not coincide, so they 
could not see each other the whole day. As the day passes by, Utena grew 
more and more depressed.  She reasoned it to being unable to share her 
excitement with Anthy. But when her last sports meet ended and Utena 
practically dragged her feet home, she can not explain the cause of her 
funk. So depressed she felt, that by the time, she unlocked the door to 
their shared room, it was already 6.15pm. 

Anthy looked at the opened door, half expecting Miki to be eagerly 
early. Soothing out her frown when it turns out to be Utena, she started 
when she saw Utena standing by the door looking despondently at her. 
Anthy rushes up to Utena &quot;Tenjou-sa..&quot; Anthy stopped at Utena&#146;s flash 
look of annoyance &quot;Utena, are you okay? Are you not feeling well? Should 
I cancel today&#146;s date?&quot; Anthy asked.  Utena shakes her head and reaches 
out for Anthy&#39;s shoulders to gently push her to arm&#39;s length. Utena 
caught a whiff of a rose scent. &quot;You look pretty tonight, Anthy.&quot; Utena 
says without much enthusiasm.  Anthy twirls around in her black 
one-piece that sports a low plunging v-neck covered by buttons. Anthy 
puts a hand on a choker surrounding her dainty neck and strikes a pose 
for Utena. &quot;You approve Tenjou-sa.. Utena?&quot; Out of sense of duty, Utena 
takes a closer look at her friend. Utena let her eyes travel from the 
tip of Anthy&#146;s tumble of luscious hair to the bottom of her cute high 
heels, and then lingered at Anthy&#146;s low neckline and the tight fit of 
the dress. Unable to say anything constructive, Utena opts to flop 
herself face-down onto Anthy&#39;s bed. 

&quot;You do not like it?&quot; Anthy asked anxiously. Utena mumbled something 
into Anthy&#39;s pillow.  Anthy sits next to Utena. Her hand moved to touch 
Utena&#39;s head but drops the hand before it touches Utena. &quot;I am sorry, 
forgive me Tenjou-sa.. Utena, if my outfit displeases you, I can change 
or I should give Miki a call to cancel the date now.&quot; As Anthy reaches 
for the phone, Utena turns around and grab Anthy&#39;s hands and rapidly 
says, &quot;You look gorgeous but I am wondering if the dress is TOO much for 
a first date.&quot; Before any of them could react to Utena&#146;s blushing face 
as she tries not to stare at Anthy&#39;s barely concealed bosom, the door 
bell rang.  Utena rushed to open it, glad to escape the unfathomable 
look Anthy is giving her. She grabs Miki&#39;s hand and pulled him in.  In 
one swift motion, she rips the itinerary from its display spot, shoves 
it into Miki&#39;s hand, turns around to grab Anthy with her other hand and 
push both of them out the door. Utena quickly slams the door onto the 
gaping faces of Miki and Anthy. 

12.55am flashed back at Utena&#39;s face as she stares at the clock in her 
hand. She paces up and down the room already in her pajamas.  &quot;The 
itinerary clearly indicated that she should be back by 11.00pm. Where 
was she?&quot; Utena fumed as she continues to pace the room. At 1.30am, she 
hears some noises outside the door and presses her ear against it. She 
hears Anthy&#39;s muffled laughter and Miki saying something unintelligible.  
Utena backs away from the door, sprints across the room and jumps up 
into her bed when she heard the door unlock. 

Anthy turns to say goodbye to Miki and slowly closes the door and walks 
across the room. Noting that Utena had left her night light on, Anthy 
move to switch the light off.  On her way, she reaches to brush aside a 
lock of hair from Utena&#39;s face. Anthy lets out of gasp of shock when 
Utena suddenly grabbed her hand. &quot;Tenjou-sama, you are awake.&quot; Anthy 
states the obvious in her surprise. 

&quot;Do you know what time it is?&quot; Utena hisses as she catches yet another 
enticing whiff of roses. Anthy meekly lowers her eyes and replied, &quot;I 
wanted to stick to the schedule but Miki insisted on playing the piano 
with me and taking me out to the Lover&#39;s Lookout&quot;. Utena tighten her 
grip on Anthy&#39;s arm involuntarily. &quot;And you just let him do that?&quot; Utena 
says with clenched teeth. All the feelings Utena had accumulated 
surfaces to a boil.

&quot;Do you know how sick with worry I was?! I was feeling anxious, scared, 
angry, and guilty. You name it, I felt it! Not to mention, the 
frustration of not being able to get a hold of you two at any of the 
places I suggested. What if Miki had done something to you?! You could 
have at least called me to say you were coming home late!!&quot;  Utena 
jumped down her bed to better face Anthy while maintaining her death 
grip of Anthy&#39;s arm. &quot;And how could you let Miki take you to Lover&#39;s 
Lookout?! You know how the hill got its name right? Only loose women 
would go there with guys on their first dates!&quot; Utena huffs. Anthy 
lowers her head and whispers, &quot;He insisted we go there to see the view. 
He refused to let me say no..&quot;

&quot;Geez, Anthy!! You should have showed some spine LIKE you always should, 
and say NO to Miki!!! How difficult is it to express yourself? And how 
could you let him take you to Lovers&#146;s Lookout?!!&quot; 

Utena rages on &quot;Why are YOU always doing this??!! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO 
WEAK?!!!!&quot; Why can you NOT express your true feelings!!? WHY DO YOU HAVE 
TO BE SUCH A COWARD?!&quot; Utena pins Anthy to the bed frame unconsciously 
as she continues to shout.  

Anthy frowns, &quot;Do you think me weak Tenjou-sama? That I am not capable 
of making a decision or act on my own?&quot; Anthy&#146;s shoulders starts to 
heave at the strain of her breath, matching Utena&#146;s, breathe by breathe.  
The air was thick with tension as their pent-up emotions threaten to 
burst. &quot;Do you not think it takes courage and strength to waking up 
every day to a responsibility one loathes with all her heart?&quot; Anthy 
shakes of Utena&#39;s grip and takes a step towards to Utena. Utena takes an 
involuntary step back. 

&quot;Do you not think it takes strength to maintain a fa&ccedil;ade and hide one&#39;s 
true self from the world to prevent one&#146;s loved ones from getting hurt?&quot;

&quot;Do you think it is easy to go do something detestable to please the 
person one loves?&quot;

&quot;Do you think it is easy to keep one&#146;s feelings bottled up inside ALL 
the time?! OR to express one&#39;s true feelings?&quot; 

Anthy punctuated each question with a firm step towards Utena, until 
Utena had no more space to back away any further. 

&quot;You certainly SEEM to have no problems expressing yourself Tenjou-sama. 
BUT, you and I both know WHO the true coward is. We both know WHO it is 
who truly cannot express her feelings.&quot; Anthy pauses and leans her body 
forward, pressing Utena&#39;s further onto the wall. &quot;Do you not think that 
making the first move takes the most courage?&quot; Anthy tilts her face 
close. Utena&#39;s eyes clouds with bewilderment as she gets caught in 
Anthy&#39;s steady emerald gaze. She notes ever so briefly in her convoluted 
mind on how she failed to notice before how strong and stanch those 
brilliant eyes are.

&quot;I .. I.. don&#146;t know what to say... or think...&quot; Utena stammered weakly. 
Anthy leaned closer until their faces are only a breath apart. &quot;Now is 
not the moment to think but act.&quot; With that, Anthy resolutely pulls 
Utena&#39;s face down and plants a kiss on Utena&#39;s lips. At first, the kiss 
was light and unsure. Then slowly, both sets of lips begin to soften and 
seek to make the kiss more intimate.  The light furtive kisses gave way 
to deeper more passionate kisses. The first cautious meet of the tongues 
cause both to shiver.  Ever so slowly, Anthy deliberately unbuttons 
Utena&#39;s pajama top one by one. Once done, Anthy lays a sure hand on 
Utena&#39;s breast.  A tiny whimper escaped from Utena as words failed her 
for the first time. 

Anthy laughs softly against Utena&#39;s lips as she slowly explores the 
delicate curves of Utena&#39;s body with her inquisitive hands.  Anthy 
continues her exploration of Utena&#146;s taut athletic body. &quot;How I have 
longed to touch you, Tenjou-sama,&quot; Anthy whispers hotly, &quot;To feel your 
every curve, to savor how your body react as I run my fingers all over 
it, feel your warmth and take in your smell.&quot; Anthy leans to touch her 
nose to the corner of Utena&#39;s neck. &quot;You smell like the sun. Healthy and 
strong with your confidence in life. But, it takes courage to make the 
first move towards what we both want, don&#39;t you agree?&quot; Anthy whispers 
into Utena&#39;s blushing ear. Utena slides down into Anthy&#146;s arms, her legs 
unable to support herself or unable to acknowledge the truth of the last 
question. Anthy leans Utena to the wall as she pushes the Utena&#39;s top 
completely out the way.  She starts tracing Utena&#39;s outline with her 
lips, interspersing the kisses with tiny licks and bites. Utena offers 
her neck, shoulders, arms, legs, fingers, toes, her life and soul to 
make sure Anthy does not stop what she is doing as Utena succumbs to the 
web of seduction Anthy is casting over her.  Anthy looks into Utena&#39;s 
eyes briefly before continuing her path to Utena&#39;s pert pink nipples. 
Slowly without breaking eye contact, Anthy takes the nipples one by one 
into her mouth. Utena closes her eyes unable to bear the strength of 
Anthy&#39;s ardent stare. Chuckling, Anthy continues to nibble, lick, kiss, 
caress and squeeze in cadence with Utena&#39;s almost inaudible moans. 

Utena is barely aware as the last vestige of her clothing is removed and 
Anthy&#39;s warm full-clothed body covers her naked one.  Anthy&#39;s hands 
moves sometimes roughly and sometimes gently all over her body as Anthy 
takes turns between whispering sweet seductive words into her burning 
hot ears and paying lavish attention to her body. Utena has never felt 
experienced anything so intense. Her body felt like it was on fire. It 
was like every pleasure nerve she had or never knew she had is being 
switched on one by one by Anthy&#39;s administrations. 

Utena reaches out for Anthy, unsure if the moans are coming from her or 
Anthy. Utena holds Anthy tight to in effort of holding to something more 
stable as she is hit by an intense wave of need and desire for something 
she can not identify yet.  She shudders at each whispered word from 
Anthy, claws and moans with increasingly intense lick, kiss or bite. 
Yet, nothing prepared her for how she felt when Anthy laid the first 
tentative touch at the core of her desire. She buried her burning face 
into Anthy&#39;s neck, wanting more, however, embarrassed by everything.  
May I? whispers Anthy. Utena can do no more but nod in Anthy&#39;s warm 
crook.  

She feels Anthy&#39;s gentle touch surely and lovingly lay possession of her 
wet warmth. Utena no longer cared how loud her moans are.  She had to 
let it out, otherwise she would explode.  Utena almost died from the 
pleasure pain when Anthy gently slipped a finger in her.  She felt the 
tension in Anthy&#39;s shoulder and neck as Anthy held her breath and hands 
very still for that moment, waiting. &quot;Please..&quot; was all Utena could 
whisper as she hugs Anthy closer to her body, wanting to absorb Anthy 
into her person. Utena felt the sudden untauting of Anthy&#39;s body like a 
arrow sprung a bow. She felt Anthy expel her breath as Anthy&#39;s finger 
begins to move slowly and rhythmically within her. The finger continued 
to stoke and quench, quench and stoke the very nucleus of her desire. 
Soon, Utena feels herself lost in the sensation. Spurred on the Anthy&#39;s 
murmurs and whispers of encouragement, Utena reached for that thing her 
body is screaming for.  Then, suddenly, just as Anthy&#39;s body went rigid 
before with fear of hurting her lover, Utena&#39;s froze at the height of 
her desire.  Time, space and her physical being ceased to exist as she 
reached the crescendo of her orgasm.  Spent, her body went completely 
slack, dropping sideways. Anthy tries to catch Utena. But tired by her 
own exertions, and forced by the inertia of the sudden fall, Anthy 
failed to prevent both of them from tumbling to the floor. 

Anthy lays very still, feeling and enjoying the whole weight of Utena on 
top of her. She senses that at that moment, Utena could not move even if 
she tried. She smiles as she ran her arms soothingly along Utena&#39;s back 
and arms. After a moment, she feels Utena stirring and struggling to 
prop herself up on her arms. Anthy smiles up at Utena. Utena smiles 
weakly back at her. Anthy smile grows wider as Utena&#39;s face turns bright 
red at the memory of what just passed. When Utena starts to turn her 
head away in embarrassment, Anthy puts her hands on Utena&#39;s face and 
gives Utena a gentle kiss.  Utena smiles and looks intently into Anthy&#39;s 
eyes.  What Utena found there made her begin to pour sweet soft slow 
kisses all over Anthy&#39;s face. Utena clumsily moves to one side to try to 
unbutton Anthy&#146;s dress when Anthy stopped her hand. &quot;You do not have to 
do this&quot;, Anthy says. Utena kisses Anthy&#39;s hand away and replied &quot;Oh, we 
must. Now that someone has proven her courage in making the first move, 
this humble novice begs to be allowed to demonstrate her feeble attempt 
at courage.&quot; Then, it was Anthy&#39;s turn to blush and moan as Utena proved 
her skill as a very apt and courageous demonstrator.

Later on, their desires overly spent, as they lay in each other arms 
slowly and gently caressing and kissing each other, Anthy turned to 
Utena and asks cheekily, &quot;Do you still want me to date Miki or any other 
boys?&quot; Utena turned to look at Anthy&#146;s face incredulously. &quot;ABSOLUTELY 
NOT!&quot; Utena punctuated her answer with a nip at Anthy&#146;s shoulders.  

She rolls over so she can look down at the prostrate Anthy while her 
pink locks cascade down her shoulders and her face. With an upturned 
smile, Anthy meekly lowers her eyes and nods, &quot;Yes, Utena, whatever you 
say.&quot; Anthy&#39;s smile disappeared as she observes that Utena does note 
rise to the bait but starts to have an intense look on her face.  Anthy 
put a hand on Utena&#39;s cheek. &quot;What is it, Utena?&quot; 

Utena kisses the hand and said, &quot;Nothing.. I am just happy that you 
chose to call me Utena instead of Tenjou-sama all on your own.&quot; Utena 
continues to trail her kisses up Anthy&#39;s bare hand. Anthy reaches to 
tuck an errant lock away from Utena&#39;s face. 

&quot;However,&quot; Utena continues, &quot;I shall now have to punish you for each 
time you pretend to be this meek cow that you are absolutely undeniably 
not!&quot; Utena threatened.  Anthy laughs throatily. &quot;Oh.. hmm.. what kind 
of punishment are we talking about here?&quot; Anthy asks smilingly, arching 
her eyebrow as she traces Utena&#39;s breasts with both hands.  Utena grabs 
and pins Anthy&#146;s distracting arms above her head with one hand. &quot;I will 
show you what sort of punishment!&quot; Utena reaches down with her other 
hand, feeling the spreading wetness of her lover&#39;s core. &quot;You little 
tart!&quot; Utena says laughingly as she kisses Anthy. &quot;I will punish you 
every day for the rest of our lives, I will!&quot;
