--------------------------------------------------

 The train was empty, almost deserted. The sun had already 
gone down and it felt eerie driving through the night. 
Noises from the train were mixing with the howling of the 
wind and it sounded and looked like dark creatures were 
screaming at the train, screaming about their pains, about 
their fears, releasing them. It seemed as if all the fears 
and pains were being sucked into Anthy, as if she had a 
natural ability to absorb those kinds of emotions. All she 
could do was hold close her picture, her talisman that 
would protect her. Utena was smiling at her from the 
picture and Anthy found relief in those eyes.

 The trip seemed to last forever and she felt as if she 
had entered another world then had to get used to the old 
one she came back to as she stepped off the train. She 
spent a long time looking at the picture of her and Utena. 
Lately there were so many things she wanted to know about 
her, questions that she never asked... And probably never 
will because they seemed insignificant. Like how she lived 
before they met... Like why she wanted to be Anthy&#39;s 
friend...

 Anthy&#39;s purple hair hang loose and she missed the feeling 
of a pair of blue eyes looking at her. Utena used to offer 
brushing her hair and when she did she often smelled it 
and caressed the skin on the back of her neck. And every 
time she caught herself doing it she stopped immediately. 
Anthy had enjoyed it. Nevertheless she never told her so. 
Standing at the window in her nightgown in the unfamiliar 
dark room she wished she had done so, wished she had 
caressed Utena&#39;s skin, just once, so she&#39;d know how it 
feels, so she&#39;d know if it made a difference. She wished 
she&#39;d have told her she liked her.

 Now just the lonesome empty bed was waiting for her and 
somewhere in this town was Utena maybe. As Anthy closed 
her eyes her thoughts went out to Utena. Tomorrow she&#39;d 
search for her. If she was here she will find her. Because 
she didn&#39;t want to live on without her. She could but she 
didn&#39;t want to. It felt like being crippled.
