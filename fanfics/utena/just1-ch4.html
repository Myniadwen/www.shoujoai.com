<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/just1-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>I love her.

&quot;Catch that stick, Hamlet!&quot; The big brown dog barked and his tail 
clapped on the ground as the animal sat down. Looking impatiently up 
at the pink haired girl. Utena grinned and winked with the stick. The 
dog&#39;s eyes followed it. &quot;Catch it, my good boy.&quot; She shouted and threw 
it through the garden. The dog barked again and chased after the wood.

I love her.

&quot;That&#39;s my good boy, Hamlet! And now, give up!&quot; But the dog didn&#39;t 
want to give up the prey. So soon Utena fought with the brown pet and 
soon they both laid on the grass. The girl was laughing, the dog 
growling friendly. Both not wanting to let go of the stick. 

I love her.

Anthy sat on the veranda, her injured foot was wrapped in a soft 
blanket and laid on another chair. She held a glass with cold water in 
her hands and watched Utena playing with her doggy. It was another hot 
day and the bronze girl was grateful to sit in the veranda&#39;s shadow. 
So that she didn&#39;t sweat too much. So that she would not have to 
shower twice a day. Of course she liked to shower. To stand under the 
nice fresh water and to wash her hairs. The more she liked it when 
Utena washed her hairs for her. But somehow Anthy didn&#39;t dare to ask 
her best friend again to do her that favour. She asked for so much 
during the past days. Maybe too much...

&quot;Hamlet! That&#39;s MY stick. Give it to me and I&#39;ll throw it again. Okay? 
HAMLET!&quot;

&quot;Chu chu.&quot; Commented Chuchu on Anthy&#39;s right shoulder and nibbled 
again on a biscuit. Anthy smiled and stroke his fur. Then she watched 
again the tall girl.

I love her.

It took her some days to recognize it. To look deep into her heart and 
to see it there. Her feelings she had for the tall girl from the first 
moment on when she saw her. When she fought against Saionji and won. 
Won her, the Rose Bride, but didn&#39;t want her. Not as an owning, not as 
thing, but as friend. She talked to her, not pushed her away when she 
was in the way. She saw in her a real human being, a girl, not a 
trophy you won together with a valuable sword in a duel.

Hai, she loved that wild, impatient and so often very loud girl. The 
crazy girl who was addicted to chocolate and had to tease Chuchu 
around. The funny girl who made her giggle and laugh when she tickled 
her. The tender girl who made her feel welcome. Who made her feel 
being home. She loved her with all her heart and feared the moment she 
would be forced to leave her.

But she doesn&#39;t love me in return.

Anthy sighed slightly and looked into her water glass. Utena didn&#39;t 
believe into the engagement. 

And why did she take you on vacations then?

Why did she introduce you to her aunt? To her childhood&#39;s friend Kei?

Why did she care so nice for you? 

To let you swim again without fear?

To protect you from the thunderstorm?

To wash your hears under the shower?

Why???

Anthy sighed again and watched how the water moved from one rim to the 
other one as she moved the glass slightly.

Because she thinks that I am her friend. It&#39;s simply her kind of 
caring for a friend.

In that way?

Do you really think so?

Do you really?

Do you?

Shut up!

&quot;Hamlet... please... &quot; Utena laughed and the dog answered growling. 
Both not willingly of letting go.

&quot;When little children play...&quot; giggled a voice behind her and Anthy 
turned around. Utena&#39;s aunt leaned against the door frame and looked 
over to her niece. How Utena laid on the grass, fighting with her dog. 
She saw how a white shirt and brown fur got dirty and sighed. Pink 
hairs were messed and Utena proved once more what a wild tomboy she 
indeed was.

&quot;Anthy?&quot;

&quot;Hai? Shall I help you, Tenj... auntie?&quot; Anthy put the glass aside and 
stood up. Taking her crutch and looking attentive at the tall woman. 
Rinja gulped. She simply wasn&#39;t used to someone who was so quick to 
help her. Of course Utena did help her, too, but Rinja normally needed 
hours to convince her niece. 

&quot;Hai, indeed. There&#39;s a favour you could do for me.&quot; She said and 
opened the door. To let Anthy step into the house. They could hear 
that Utena finally got the stick and held it up to the air. Hamlet 
jumped barking around her feet. Until she threw the wood again.

&quot;Little children.&quot; Said Rinja again and they both giggled. The tall 
woman showed the girl to sit down and went over to her sleeping room. 
&quot;Today you want to go to the festivities in our park, right? Today is 
our town&#39;s holiday and I guess you&#39;ll have a lot of fun.&quot; Rinja 
laughed as she came back into the living room. She held a bundle over 
her arms. &quot;Guess Utena will eat too many candied apples like every 
year and be sick tomorrow. But don&#39;t worry, she&#39;ll survive it.&quot;

&quot;Then she shouldn&#39;t eat so much, right?&quot;

Rinja looked at the small girl and smiled friendly. Remembering how 
sweet they both had looked. In the bed some days before. After a long 
night with a heavy thunderstorm. Rinja didn&#39;t know what it was, but 
something about Anthy was special.

&quot;That say someone who jumped after a chocolate bar.&quot;

Anthy blushed and Rinja laughed again.

&quot;This festival is tradition and a lot of people go there in a kimono.&quot; 
Rinja opened the bundle and held a dark violet kimono in her hands. 
&quot;Utena doesn&#39;t want to wear it. It once belonged to her mother, but 
she&#39;s too wild and doesn&#39;t want to wear a skirt as she calls it. But 
it&#39;s a pity to let it fall to dust in the cupboard. It&#39;s a little bit 
too long for you, Anthy, but I can fix that.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes grew wide and she stretched her hands to touch the 
incredible soft cloth.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; she whispered and blinked. 

I don&#39;t even belong to family and then I should wear such a valuable 
kimono?

&quot;What if I&#39;ll dirty it this evening? What if I stumble over my crutch 
and destroy it? I would never forgive myself for ruining it.&quot;

Rinja looked first at the kimono, than at Anthy. Seeing the concern in 
purple eyes. Knowing that this kimono had been too long locked up in 
an old wardrobe.

&quot;Please, Anthy, do me that favour. It would be an honour for me.&quot;

Anthy nodded and finally bowed.

&quot;If you want it, I&#39;ll wear it, Tenjoh-san.&quot;

&quot;Auntie!&quot;

&quot;Gomen...&quot;

&quot;You are a nice girl, Anthy. Don&#39;t know how Utena got to such a nice 
friend like you.&quot; Laughed Rinja and held the kimono against the bronze 
girl&#39;s body. &quot;Don&#39;t know how you can share a room with someone like my 
niece. I mean, we all know how her wardrobe looks like.&quot;

They both smiled but Anthy&#39;s smile faded as Rinja turned around to get 
her needle to shorten the kimono so that it would fit.

It&#39;s easy to live with her, because she likes me.

Anthy stared at her hands still holding the soft cloth tight.

But she doesn&#39;t love me...

***

Utena brushed her hairs without looking into the mirror. She wore 
washed, white jeans that would be surely dirty when they would return 
in the night. But right now it looked very good. Together with the 
deep blue shirt she decided to wear. The same blue as her eyes.

&quot;Anthy? Are you ready?&quot; she knocked impatiently at the bathroom door 
and put the brush away. Searching for her purse in the chaos of her 
room. After five minutes she really found it. Together with the money 
her aunt gave her. Telling her that they should buy themselves some 
sweets and go by the great dipper or the Ferris wheel which with you 
could overlook the whole town. And the near forests and lakes.

&quot;Anthy? Common, you never needed such a long time to get ready!&quot; 
protested Utena and glanced at her watch. They wanted to meet Kei 
there who still had to work and she didn&#39;t want to be late. At least 
not later as usually. &quot;Are you feeling fine, Anthy? Does your foot 
hurt again? Shall I come in?&quot;

&quot;I am ready.&quot; Came the calm voice from inside and the door opened. 
&quot;You are really impatient... Utena.&quot; Anthy smiled and stepped out of 
the corridor. She still needed her crutch to lean on but her foot got 
better with every day and she hoped soon to be able to take away the 
bandage and to walk normal again.

&quot;That&#39;s good. Then let&#39;s...&quot; Utena turned around and simply forgot 
what she wanted to say. Her blue eyes grew wide and her jaw simply 
dropped as she looked at Anthy. The normal Anthy she knew almost a 
whole school term now. But somehow that normal Anthy looked different 
today. She had put her hairs together, like always. The hairdo was 
different. It looked more like the traditional hairdos woman had done 
in Japan centuries ago. Young women still did on special days. A white 
rose was braided into violet curls and some strands fell softly over 
Anthy&#39;s shoulders.

The kimono!

Utena stared surprised at the violet kimono. Fitting perfectly to 
Anthy&#39;s colours of the hair. My mother&#39;s kimono...

The tall girl gulped and felt how her heart beat increased again. Just 
like it had been when they had taken a shower together. To prevent 
that Anthy would fall down and hurt her already injured foot even 
more. Just like it had been when they embraced in the bed. To be 
protected against the wild thunderstorm outside.

She looks so strange.

Anthy felt uncomfortable and gulped.

&quot;Your aunt gave it to me, because you don&#39;t want to wear it...&quot; she 
whispered and lowered her head. &quot;If you don&#39;t want me to wear it, I&#39;ll 
change.&quot; Anthy bowed slightly, leaning hard on her crutch. &quot;I know 
it&#39;s your mother&#39;s one. Gomen nasai if I hurt your feelings.&quot; With 
those words she wanted to turn around and to go again into the 
bathroom. But Utena held her back. Softly she took her shoulders and 
turned the smaller girl around. Blue eyes sparkled with tears Anthy 
knew Utena would never cry.

&quot;It&#39;s fine, Anthy. It can&#39;t lay the whole time in the wardrobe. I am 
sure my mother would be happy to see you like that. It simply doesn&#39;t 
fit to me, Anthy, but it fits perfectly to you.&quot; Whispered the tall 
girl and smiled a shaky smile. &quot;You look simply beautiful, Anthy.&quot;

The bronze girl felt how she blushed and lowered her gaze. Not knowing 
what to do, not knowing how to react. Utena often teased her around 
with such words, but this time she meant the compliment. Anthy wasn&#39;t 
used to compliments. Especially not so serious ones.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you want to leave one hour ago?&quot; called Rinja and looked 
through the kitchen&#39;s door. She would open her restaurant soon and 
couldn&#39;t come with them. She even offered to take care for Chuchu who 
sat patiently on her shoulder and waited to get something from the 
nice food she created for her customers. Happily he was right now 
nibbling on a small roll she made extra for him. Like the dog still 
chewed on a little piece of meat.

&quot;Surely Kei already searches for you, junior.&quot;

Utena coughed, then she giggled.

&quot;He&#39;s used to that.&quot; She laughed and shrugged her shoulders. &quot;And you 
really don&#39;t need my help, auntie?&quot;

&quot;Off you go, junior! Have fun you two and don&#39;t eat too much candied 
apples, junior!&quot;

&quot;Auntie!&quot;

Anthy giggled and was happy that she could keep that kimono on for 
today. That she didn&#39;t insult Utena and that her best friend seemed to 
like the way she looked right now.

&quot;Let&#39;s escape, Anthy, before she gives us more advice.&quot; Said Utena, 
took Anthy&#39;s free hand and helped her out of the house and over the 
small staircase.

&quot;And don&#39;t drive the great dipper two times after another! You know 
what happened the last time, junior.&quot; Utena groaned as the voice 
followed them. A laughing voice. Anthy saw the tortured look on her 
best friend&#39;s face and giggled amused.

***

The air was nice warm. Even tough the sun was setting. Its warm light 
shone down on the country beneath. A lot of people were in the park. 
Laughing. Talking. Chatting. Little children ran around and tried to 
catch each other. Couples deeply in love held hands and older couples, 
being long married, were still happy to have the other one. They 
bought candies and wine. Sake and cookies for good luck. Telling them 
their future on little sheets inside.

&quot;... and then we drove it twice after another.&quot; Told Utena while they 
walked through all the people. Along so many little shops. Selling 
mostly food. &quot;Kei was green in the face afterwards. And when I say 
green, I mean green. He didn&#39;t want to eat anything during the past 
days.&quot; Utena laughed and Anthy giggled. 

&quot;And how did you feel afterwards?&quot;

&quot;Not better, Anthy. I didn&#39;t turn green, but prayed long to the 
porcelain god. The worst was that I did eat too many...&quot; Utena&#39;s look 
got caught by something and her head turned while she walked. Her 
voice trailed off and her eyes started to sparkle. &quot;Wait a second, 
Anthy.&quot; She said and disappeared through the mass. Anthy frowned and 
walked over to the rim of the small path leading through an allay of 
trees. Here was a small gap between the shops and she stood in 
pleasant nice shadows. Some lights danced around her and she 
recognized them as glow worms. She smiled and reached her hand out. 
One landed on her palm and she watched it thinking. It was strange. 
She had never been on such a festival before. She didn&#39;t know the town 
nor its history. She didn&#39;t know the people here nor the owners of the 
little shops. But she felt comfortable here. As if she would really 
belong here. To this small place. As if she was home here.

Home...

She felt how tears watered in her eyes. She wished so much to have a 
home. A real home. A place she could return to whenever she felt alone 
and fragile. Whenever she couldn&#39;t bear that life at school any 
longer. Whenever she needed simply a comforting gesture, a calm word.

Wish I could stay here. Simply here. With auntie Rinja and Hamlet. 
With Utena...

Anthy raised her head and looked at the coloured sky above. It was 
still bright and covered with orange and red shades at the west but 
turned to get darker, blue until black at the east. The first stars 
were sparkling and the whole atmosphere was somehow romantic. Anthy 
never really believed in love nor in romantic. She wanted to believe 
in it after she got to know Utena, but the tall girl told her more 
than once that she didn&#39;t believe in their engagement. But she 
believed in their friendship.

Friends...

It was less Anthy wished, but it was more than she had ever had. A 
good friend she could rely on. She could lean on. Who would catch her 
if she would fall.

Somewhere there was music. Japanese folk music. Surely live music. It 
was played with a lot of love and wasn&#39;t very loud. Someone sang along 
to the professional singers and Anthy simply liked it here. Once again 
she wished to be able to stop time. To rest forever here. To make this 
summer never end. To stay here forever. Together with her Utena who 
was surely buying some sweets. The whole way to the park she had 
talked about the past festivals she mostly spent with her aunt or with 
Kei. Eating one candied apple after another. They took the bus to get 
there and Utena cared for Anthy not to stumble over her crutch. Some 
people looked strange at her, but some girls, some of Utena&#39;s former 
classmates, recognized her and they talked, too. Laughed over long 
gone times. Each of them telling Utena what happened to this teacher 
and that teacher. They looked curious at Anthy and declared her their 
sympathy as they found out that she was now Utena&#39;s best friend. Of 
course Utena complained and the girls laughed teasing.

A small town. Everyone knows everyone.

Anthy lowered her gaze again and watched the passing people for 
another long time. They met on the path and embraced each other. 
Yelling their names. Waving their arms. Laughing happily. This was a 
holiday, their holiday. There was no reason for being upset. Not 
today, not this single evening.

Everyone seems to like each other.

Anthy wrapped her arms around her body and shivered slightly. Still 
holding the crutch in one of her hands. Suddenly she froze.

I wish I would belong here. To all those people. I wish so badly I was 
one of them...

&quot;White or brown chocolate?&quot; asked Utena and appeared so suddenly 
before her that Anthy jerked back. But she could hold back her balance 
and looked with big, surprised eyes at her best friend.

&quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;I bought candied apples. With white and with brown chocolate. Which 
one do you want, Anthy?&quot; asked Utena and crossed her arms behind her 
back. So that Anthy couldn&#39;t see her hands nor the apples. Blue eyes 
sparkled and Utena was slightly blushed. 

&quot;It&#39;s alike. Give me what you don&#39;t want.&quot; Answered the bronze girl 
and smiled one of those soft smiles Utena liked so much to see. 

&quot;But that would be unfair.&quot;

&quot;Just gimme one.&quot; Anthy tried to peek, but Utena danced around her so 
that she had no chance to get a look at one of the apples.

&quot;And if that one doesn&#39;t taste?&quot;

&quot;I never ate such an apple before, how can I tell which one does taste 
and which one not?&quot; replied Anthy and blushed because she felt still a 
little bit ashamed to give in whenever she didn&#39;t know things that 
were completely normal for other people. For normal people. Not for 
people like her. The Rose Bride who never had been on such a festival 
before. But Utena didn&#39;t mind. She only giggled, holding the apples 
tighter on her back.

&quot;Okay, then close your eyes, Anthy. I&#39;ll make you taste both and then 
you decide which one you want to have, okay?&quot;

&quot;If you think so...&quot; Anthy looked doubtful at Utena&#39;s grinning face 
and finally closed her eyes. Gave in her destiny. She knew how 
stubborn Utena could be and she didn&#39;t gave her anything before she 
didn&#39;t decide voluntarily.

&quot;Good. But I only want a small piece, don&#39;t try to choke me with the 
whole apple.&quot;

&quot;You already know me, right?&quot;

Anthy raised her eyebrows but kept her eyes closed. Hearing the far 
away music. Hearing the mumbling of the people chatting and laughing 
around them. Hearing the children screaming when they tried to catch 
each other.

&quot;I try not to kill you, I promise.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s nice.&quot;

Anthy heard Utena giggle and leaned herself a little bit harder on the 
crutch. Utena saw it.

&quot;Does your foot hurt?&quot;

&quot;Nope. And where&#39;s the apple? I am waiting.&quot; Anthy smiled again a soft 
smile and her cheeks blushed slightly. She stood there, only on one 
leg. The long kimono almost covered her feet completely. It had the 
same violet colour than her eyes and showed how slim she was. Just 
like it showed her female outlines. Her hips and her breasts under the 
fine cloth. A light breeze of wind played with the violet curls that 
escaped her complicate hairdo. Softly they touched her shoulders. Glow 
worms danced around her and lightened up her face.

She&#39;s so beautiful.

&quot;I am waiting. Or do you secretly eat it all by yourself?&quot; Anthy 
giggled and her lips curved. So soft looking lips. 

&quot;Give in, Utena, you are simply too greedy.&quot;

She called me Utena. Without hesitation. Simply like that...

The tall girl didn&#39;t think any longer. Still holding the apples behind 
her back she stepped a little bit closer and leaned over Anthy. 

She is so beautiful in that kimono. So beautiful...

Utena saw how Anthy frowned but still didn&#39;t open her eyes. Then she 
simply placed her lips on the smaller girl&#39;s ones. Feeling that they 
were as soft as she had imagined. It was only a light touch, but the 
most gentlest they both had ever experienced. As Utena wanted to stop 
it, Anthy let go of the crutch. It landed somewhere on the ground but 
they both didn&#39;t care about it. The bronze girl wrapped her arms 
around Utena&#39;s neck and brought her nearer to her body. Then she 
repeated the kiss with all her deep feelings. The folk music died 
away, just like the chattering people. The whole world seemed to 
disappear for them. For two girls standing in the shadows of two 
trees, being only surrounded by the light of small glow worms.

I love you so much, Utena.

Anthy...

&quot;Mommy? Look!&quot; A small child&#39;s voice brought them back into reality. 
They broke the kiss and turned their heads. To look at a little girl 
who stood right beside them. Looking curiously up to them. Eating her 
ice cream with passion.

&quot;Yakoo, I told you, not to point with your finger on other people.&quot; 
Her mother hurried and took her daughter by her hand. &quot;That&#39;s 
impolite.&quot;

&quot;But mommy...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t like it when other people stare at you, do you?&quot;

&quot;Hai...&quot;

They walked away and slowly, very slowly Utena looked again at a deep 
blushed Anthy.

&quot;White or brown chocolate?&quot; was all she managed to ask and gulped. The 
desire of kissing the smaller girl was almost irresistible. It was as 
strong as the confusion in her mind.

I kissed her!

Why did I do that?

Why?

Why do one kiss other people, uh?

But other girls...

Don&#39;t you really know the answer?

Don&#39;t you really, smart girl?

Hm?

But...

Anthy searched in blue eyes that sparkled so mysteriously.

&quot;Only chocolate?&quot; she replied and blushed even deeper. Still having 
her arms being wrapped around Utena&#39;s neck. Holding on her while 
hobbling on her healthy foot.

&quot;Well...&quot; gulped Utena and held two apples in the air. One was covered 
with a brown mass, the other one with a white one. Her hands shook 
slightly.

&quot;Then I&#39;ll take the white one. Arigato.&quot; Anthy didn&#39;t want to let go, 
but she knew she had to. Here were too many people around and Utena 
looked suddenly very confused and unsure. The bronze girl stumbled 
backwards and thanked her best friend when she gave her the crutch 
back.

Best friend? Is she really only my best friend?

What do you want her to be?

What? What? What?

Shut up!

&quot;Anthy! Utena! I searched you all over the place!&quot; A young man came 
running to them and waved his hands. They both stepped, still blushed 
like a tomato, out of the shadow and walked slowly over to him. At 
least Anthy walked slowly with her crutch. Enjoying her white candied 
apple. Utena took a big bite before she ran over to Kei. Again they 
made their welcome dance that made the bronze girl giggle each time 
and soon Utena chased after Kei who stole her brown candied apple.

&quot;You work, Kei! You have enough money to buy yourself an own apple!&quot; 
she complaind but he only laughed and tried to be even faster. Anthy 
only shook her head and watched them amused. The fight stopped about 
five minutes later when the apple was eaten and the two crazy 
teenagers stood right in front of the big dipper. Two blue eyes 
sparkled and they both looked a little bit like children.

&quot;We have to take that challenge.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;To prove that we are real men.&quot;

&quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;A brave man and girl.&quot;

&quot;Better.&quot;

They both giggled.

&quot;I am sure it&#39;s great. It&#39;s even higher than the one last year.&quot;

&quot;Really? Great!&quot; 

They both giggled and Utena turned towards Anthy who still ate her 
apple. She ate much more slowly than her best friend and her face told 
the tall girl that she wasn&#39;t very keen on using the big machine.

&quot;Do you mind when we ride it?&quot;

&quot;Nope. I&#39;ll wait here, Utena.&quot; Smiled Anthy and hobbled over to a bank 
to sit down. From here she had a perfect look over to the big dipper. 
&quot;But only once, okay, guys?&quot;

&quot;Rinja told her?&quot; asked Kei and looked suddenly guilty.

&quot;Partly. I told her about your green face.&quot; Giggled Utena and soon 
they were chasing each other around again. Running towards the 
entrance. Calling the other one a lazy chicken.

They are two tomboys. The both of them.

Anthy wondered slightly why they weren&#39;t a couple. They had the same 
hot temper and knew each other for such a long time. But the bronze 
girl never found the courage to ask Utena nor Kei. She didn&#39;t want to 
hurt them because of her curiosity.

Anthy finished her apple and threw the remaining in a dustbin next to 
her bank. Watching how they both stood for ten more minutes at the 
counter. How they finally got into the big dipper and started their 
drive. They both winked at Anthy before they got in and the bronze 
girl smiled. With a wide grin on her face, because Utena was suddenly 
pale and Kei almost green.

&quot;Hello, may I sit down?&quot;

Anthy looked up and saw a girl standing there. She was some years 
older. Maybe she was 18 or even 19. Her brown hairs were cut short and 
she wore a kimono with bright colours. White and yellow dominated.

&quot;Of course, here&#39;s still enough space.&quot; Anthy took her crutch and 
slipped a little bit away to make it more comfortable for the girl.

&quot;Arigato.&quot; The girl sat down and smiled friendly at her. She had some 
various bags she put down on the ground. With a fan she tried to catch 
fresh air. &quot;It&#39;s still amazingly hot.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Answered Anthy and winked back as two persons reached the 
highest point of the big dipper. Soon the wagons crashed down with 
incredible speed and the bronze girl giggled as she heard two known 
voices scream.

&quot;I am Toki Ayani.&quot; Introduced the girl and bowed slightly.

&quot;I am Himemiya Anthy.&quot; Bowed Anthy back and giggled again as the big 
dipper reached the looping. More screaming increased.

She is really like a baby.

But I love her the way she is...

&quot;Do you know Utena well, Anthy?&quot; asked Ayani suddenly and saw how the 
smile froze slightly on the still blushed face.

&quot;We are classmates. You know her, too, Toki-san?&quot;

Toki-san? What&#39;s that for a nonsense? Does she think I am a fool and 
fall into her trap or what?

&quot;We used to be very good friends, Anthy. Very, very good friends.&quot;

Anthy didn&#39;t like the way the other girl pronounced &gt;very&lt; but she 
didn&#39;t ask. She didn&#39;t want to make a friend of Utena angry, because 
she didn&#39;t want to make the tall girl herself angry.

&quot;Did she never mention me?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Answered Anthy and looked again over to the big dipper.

Strange? Who is that girl? Utena told me so much about her friends, 
even about her classmates at her old school, but she never mentioned 
her. Does she make it all up? Who is that girl?

Anthy felt more and more uncomfortable.

&quot;She was thirteen when we met. Sweet little thirteen. She grew a lot 
during the past three years.&quot;

Nani?

Sweet?

Little?

My strong Utena sweet and little? Is that girl crazy?

&quot;Hope you don&#39;t make too high hopes yourself, Anthy. She won&#39;t return 
your feelings.&quot;

Nani?!?

Anthy&#39;s eyes grew wide but she didn&#39;t know what to reply. So she kept 
sitting there, hoping that the other two would return soon. That Utena 
would explain her who that strange girl was and what she meant with 
her unclear words.

&quot;Utena waits for her prince. Don&#39;t you know, Anthy? She believes that 
a wonderful prince saved her life after her parent&#39;s sudden death. Now 
she runs after that prince and won&#39;t love anyone except him. Although 
I think it&#39;s a real pity. To waste her body in that way... because she 
won&#39;t never find that prince. It&#39;s only an illusion of her mind. A 
confused child&#39;s mind. Nothing more. And no matter how hard you try, 
Anthy, you won&#39;t be that prince, too. No one will be that prince. 
She&#39;ll chase a ghost for the rest of her life and hurt all people 
around her!&quot;

Ayani almost spat out the last words. Anthy didn&#39;t want to hear those 
words any longer. They hurt inside her soul. Especially after she 
experienced that wonderful kiss only half an hour ago.

Prince, no, I am not a prince. Not at all...

She grabbed for her crutch and wanted to leave, as two hands grabbed 
her arms and pulled her back on the bank. The other girl leaned over 
to her and her brown eyes sparkled dangerously.

&quot;Who do you think you are, Anthy? Wearing her dead mother&#39;s kimono! 
You are only a small girl, no one special. I really have no idea what 
she wants from you. Maybe some distraction until she finds her so 
called prince?&quot; Ayani raised her hands and stroke over Anthy&#39;s bronze 
cheeks, along her neck and finally over her chest over the soft cloth.

&quot;What does she want from you, you little nigger, hm?&quot; 

&quot;Let me go!&quot; whispered Anthy but knew that there was no chance to 
escape. Not with her now hurting foot. The other girl was taller than 
her and looked stronger.

Please, Utena, come back!

Rescue me...

&quot;You don&#39;t look as if you were good in bed. Too thin.&quot; Now those hands 
circled around Anthy&#39;s hips and tears sparkled in purple eyes. &quot;But 
one never knows until one tries, right?&quot;

&quot;No... leave me in peace. Please!&quot; Anthy tried to turn away but was 
hold back once more.

&quot;You are nothing than a little, dirty whore. You don&#39;t have any right 
to possess her!&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

Utena... please... help me!

&quot;Hai!&quot; Brown eyes sparkled meanly and Ayani&#39;s hands hurt now.

&quot;Leave her in peace! Right now!&quot; The low voice was full with anger. 
Anthy felt how the tall girl next to her was lifted in the air and 
pushed against the trunk of the next tree. How brutal hands let her 
go. She blinked and looked at a shocked looking Kei. And at a raging 
Utena who had grabbed the other girl&#39;s kimono and looked directly into 
an amused face.

&quot;What did you think you were doing, Ayani?&quot; screamed the pink haired 
girl and bit on her lower lip as the other girl only laughed.

&quot;I wanted to test your girlfriend, little Utena. To find out what she 
has that seems to bind her to her. To her and not to me!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not funny, Ayani. You almost hurt her. Didn&#39;t you see that she 
uses a crutch?&quot;

&quot;Oh... I am sooo sorry. What happened? Did she fell out of the bed?&quot; 
mocked Ayani and pushed Utena away. They were almost the same tall and 
the same strong. They both knew that.

&quot;What do you want, Ayani? Why can&#39;t you just leave me in peace?&quot;

&quot;Why? You know that answer too well, Utena. You&#39;ve been the one who 
didn&#39;t want me.&quot;

&quot;I wanted you, Ayani.&quot;

&quot;Oh... didn&#39;t notice that.&quot; The brown haired girl shook her head and 
crossed her arms provoking before her chest.

&quot;Not the way you wanted it.&quot; Replied Utena and looked suddenly very 
exhausted. As exhausted as Anthy had hardly ever seen her before. Only 
when the tall girl talked for a long time about her parents. Or when 
she won another long and dangerous duel she almost lost. When she got 
injured and still shook. Fearing of going home - alone.

&quot;I have enough, Ayani. Three years are enough, don&#39;t ya think? Go home 
and leave us in peace. Go back to your own friends, okay?&quot; Utena 
turned around and went over to Kei who already helped Anthy up. She 
held her crutch again tight in her hands and they both looked asking 
over to their friend.

&quot;You are still the honourable Utena, right? The one with the high 
ideals and the dreams that will never come true. What about that girl? 
Is she your prince? The prince you waited for so long? So desperate 
that you oversaw everyone else? Or did you turn into a prince 
yourself? Is she your princess? Your little slave?&quot;

&quot;Go home, Ayani. Just go home, okay?&quot; Utena smiled at Kei and Anthy 
and showed them to go on. Over to the small lake where they wanted to 
catch fishes. With fragile spoons. Another Japanese tradition Anthy 
didn&#39;t know at all, but was very keen about to see finally.

&quot;How is it to be fucked by a nigger?&quot;

It happened as fast that neither Kei nor Anthy could react. With an 
angry scream Utena swirled around and Ayani was again pinched against 
the trunk. Her mean smile broke slightly and she seemed to be 
surprised that the younger girl was so much stronger. Stronger than 
she had been just three years ago.

&quot;Don&#39;t... you... dare... to... insult...my...Anthy...&quot; spat Utena 
under her breath and shook the other girl madly. 

&quot;Just shut up, okay?!&quot;

&quot;It was only a question. A simply question.&quot; Mocked Ayani cruelly, but 
gasped for breath as the other girl slapped her right into the face.

&quot;It was insulting, you idiot!&quot;

&quot;Insulting? You call that insulting? And what was it what you have 
done to me?&quot;

&quot;Done to you? I gave you my friendship. I trusted you completely. And 
all you did was to push me away, Ayani. Who insulted whom, uh?&quot;

&quot;Friendship, pah! I never wanted your friendship, but your love, 
Utena.&quot;

&quot;Not love, Ayani. You don&#39;t know what love is.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s more love than your stupid ideal, Utena.&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t give it to you, you know that too well. And I wouldn&#39;t 
have given it to you!&quot;

&quot;Because of your prince, I know.&quot; Ayani rolled her brown eyes and 
glanced over Utena&#39;s shoulder. Seeing Anthy standing there. Very 
unsure. Being supported by an angry looking Kei. &quot;Still I don&#39;t know 
why you took her instead of me. I mean, I am wild and strong. I could 
play basketball with you, all she&#39;s able is to cook or so, right? Why 
not me, Utena! Why?&quot;

The tall girl took a deep breath and lowered her hands. Let the tall 
girl let again gasp for breath.

&quot;You can&#39;t force feelings, Ayani. But you never understood. Instead 
you pushed my friendship away. Live with the consequences.&quot;

&quot;While she&#39;s your whore? I won&#39;t accept...&quot; Ayani&#39;s voice was cut up 
as Utena shook her again in rage.

&quot;Shut up! Do you know how much you hurt other people?! How much you 
have always hurt them?!&quot; she shouted and Ayani did the senseless 
attempt of defending herself. Utena was very angry right now and grew 
a lot stronger than the brown haired girl had expected.

&quot;Utena...&quot; the voice was soft. Incredibly soft. Suddenly Utena let her 
go and stepped back. Taking a deep breath and clenching her fists. But 
not beating her. Ayani lowered her gaze and saw what calmed the wild 
tomboy down. The bronze girl had placed her free hand on Utena&#39;s 
shoulder and purple eyes looked silently up to blue ones. They seemed 
to talk to each other without the use of words. Finally Utena sighed.

&quot;You are right, Anthy. Let&#39;s catch some fishes for our pond, okay?&quot; 
she smiled and the smaller girl smiled back. Without looking back to 
Ayani the three turned around and walked away. Leaving a speechless 
girl behind.

***

&quot;Just another attempt, okay?&quot;

Utena held the five new spoons she bought tight in her hands and she 
ran past them. To fall on her knees and to try it again. To catch a 
little fish for her aunt&#39;s pond in the garden. The grass around her 
was already covered with broken spoons but it didn&#39;t look as if the 
tall girl would give up.

&quot;Okay, but only those spoons, baka. I am hungry and I am sure that 
Anthy wants something for supper, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh... I can wait.&quot; Smiled the bronze girl who sat on a bank near the 
lake. Kei sat next to her. He didn&#39;t even make the attempt of catching 
a fish. He knew that he was too clumsy to.

&quot;Is that why you are so thin, Anthy? Does Utena let you be hungry? 
Does she eat everything while you starve? Wouldn&#39;t surprise me.&quot; He 
raised his voice and giggled as Utena growled angrily.

&quot;I am NOT that greedy!&quot; she shouted back and groaned as another spoon 
broke and the fish escaped back into the water. The sun was now gone 
completely, but the park was illuminated by the lights of thousands of 
Chinese lanterns. Glow worms danced around them at the rim of the lake 
and the fear Anthy had felt just half an hour ago when the strange 
girl threatened her was gone.

&quot;No.&quot; Anthy shook her head and looked over to Utena who looked 
confused at another broken spoon. &quot;She&#39;s the one who always takes care 
for me. Without her I would miss more meals. Or all I would eat would 
be ice cream or chocolate. I can&#39;t cook very well and so she bought a 
cooking book and we almost let the oven explode.&quot; Anthy giggled in 
memory while a third spoon broke.

&quot;Utena and cooking? Scary thought.&quot;

They both grinned and Utena threw another spoon frustrated away.

&quot;It must be this place!&quot; she mumbled and got on her feet. &quot;I try it 
over there, okay? I&#39;ll be back soon. Take care of Anthy, Kei.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do, my master.&quot;

&quot;Baka!&quot;

They showed each other their tongues before Utena headed towards the 
other side of the lake. To try her luck there. There were enough 
fishes in the water to get caught, but as always the pink haired girl 
was too impatient.

For some moments Kei and Anthy sat there in comfortable silence and 
watched the Chinese lanterns and the full moon at the slightly cloudy 
sky. Some stars sparkled and still the air was warm. Even at the 
water. 

&quot;She didn&#39;t tell you about Ayani, right?&quot; asked the young man after a 
long time and brushed some blonde hairs out if his face. Staring at 
the lake, not at Anthy who raised her head and looked surprised at 
him.

&quot;No.&quot; Said the bronze girl and folded her hands in her lap. &quot;But I am 
sure she has her reasons.&quot;

&quot;Oh, she has them.&quot; Kei shrugged his shoulders. It wasn&#39;t his task to 
tell the smaller girl, but he knew that Utena often had a hard time in 
explaining things that still made her angry. To talk about her 
feelings. To show that she could get hurt, too. Anthy seemed to be a 
really close friend of the wild tomboy, maybe even more, and so it was 
only fair to get to know it. &quot;Utena was thirteen when Ayani moved into 
our neighbourhood three years ago. A girl who was as wild as she was. 
Who liked kendo the same way she did. Who liked it to play with 
Hamlet, who never showed fear. They were a lot common. Soon we did a 
lot together. We three. We went camping, swimming and to the cinema. I 
didn&#39;t notice it first, but Ayani had kinda crush on her.&quot; He laughed 
lowly and closed his eyes for a moment. &quot;Utena has a overwhelming 
character. I have admit that I asked her to become my girlfriend, 
too.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s eyes went wide but she didn&#39;t say a word. She knew that it was 
rude to interrupt him. And she wanted to know what it was about that 
strange girl.

&quot;But she denied and I accepted it. To be a real good friend of her is 
something special, too. I accepted her feelings and so we stayed the 
crazy team we had ever been.&quot; He giggled as he saw how Utena bought 
herself more spoons and knelt down at the other side of the lake. 
&quot;Ayani didn&#39;t. I have no idea if Utena wasn&#39;t like her. Okay, she is 
wild, but I have no idea if she likes boys or girls. We talked about 
it and she simply said that she waited for her prince. Well, everyone 
has one&#39;s own ideas and that was her vision of love. Maybe she didn&#39;t 
want Ayani, because she was a girl and not her prince, or maybe she 
simply didn&#39;t love her. However instead of understanding and staying 
her friend, too, she got angry.&quot; Kei made a sad face and looked again 
up to the moon. &quot;We knew Ayani for a whole summer and Utena trusted 
her completely. As you may have noticed, Anthy, Utena is very 
outgoing. She trusts people easily and wants to be friends with them - 
as long as they don&#39;t hurt her. And Ayani did. She tried to humiliate 
her before the whole school. It didn&#39;t work, because Utena was so 
known and so popular at school. She only got a punishment by the 
teachers and had to clean the whole classroom, but nothing more 
happened.&quot;

Anthy wanted to know what happened at school, but Kei didn&#39;t seem to 
be so keen to tell her. So she kept silent and listened instead to his 
now angry sounding voice.

&quot;Nothing of Ayani&#39;s silly games worked and so she tried to force 
Utena. She said to her that she wanted to be her friend again and went 
swimming with her. She forced herself to Utena and they both had a 
terrible fight. Utena was strong enough to defend herself, but they 
almost drowned in the water. After that Utena didn&#39;t want to see Ayani 
ever again. She never said it, but I guess she felt betrayed in her 
friendship. Soon Ayani&#39;s father got another job and she moved away. So 
we were both surprised to see her here again.&quot; He lowered his gaze 
again and looked into big violet eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Anthy, Utena is over that false friend.&quot; He looked over 
to the tall girl who looked more and more depressed, because two other 
spoons broke. &quot;I am only sorry that you had to hear all those bad 
words, Anthy. They were hurting and inexcusable.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Whispered the smaller girl, still looking at her folded 
hands. &quot;Sometimes we can&#39;t change people&#39;s mind.&quot; She thought of Toga 
and Saionji. Especially at Saionji she always had begged to leave her 
in peace. Not to beat her when she stood in the way or was boring. Not 
to hit Chuchu because he was annoying in the young man&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You like her a lot, don&#39;t you, Anthy?&quot; asked Kei finally very silent 
after another long while they sat there in silence. Each one of them 
thinking their own thoughts.

Anthy blushed deeply but it was too dark so that Kei didn&#39;t notice it. 
She raised her right hand and touched thoughtful her lips. Still 
feeling those soft lips on her own. Feeling again those strong arms 
being wrapped around her shaking body through the stormy night. 
Feeling again tender hands washing carefully her curly hairs. Again 
she saw sparkling eyes. Again she saw the first duel. When Utena was 
determined to save her friend&#39;s honour and to save the strange girl 
from the brutal young man&#39;s character. Again she saw the grin on 
Utena&#39;s face when she discovered that they would share a room - and 
started to get it all messed.

I love her. No matter what will happen in the future, but I love her.

Anthy&#39;s eyes watered.

&quot;Hai, I do.&quot; she answered finally very, very quietly and gulped. 
Looking surprised up as she felt a hand squeezing her left shoulder. 
Blue eyes shone understanding and friendly. Hai, Kei was a real 
friend. Like the brother Utena never had. Like the brother Anthy 
always wanted to have.

&quot;Do you know what, Anthy? I guess she likes you a lot, too. She only 
needs her time to show it.&quot; He grinned as Utena threw another spoon on 
the ground. &quot;Let&#39;s save our hero from starving and forget about all 
those fishes, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Anthy took her crutch and came slowly on her feet. &quot;Kei?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot; he asked and turned around towards the smaller girl.

&quot;Arigato.&quot;

&quot;No problem, Anthy. You are a nice girl and you care a lot for her. 
She&#39;s happy when you around. And that makes me happy.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you sad?&quot;

&quot;Well, a little bit, I have to admit. But it would have never been 
right. I mean, we are both crazy and wild. Think of the poor 
children.&quot; He shrugged his shoulders. &quot;She is a prince and I am 
looking for a princess. Hey, I am only 19. I still have enough time to 
find my soul mate.&quot;

They both smiled and walked over to Utena who was already raging, 
because all the fishes escaped and every, really every spoon broke.

***

&quot;Incredible. You really tried it for the first time, Anthy?&quot;

Kei looked at the two fishes swimming happily in the little plastic 
bag filled with lake water. They sat now on a table outside a small 
restaurant and waited to get their late suppers. Utena found something 
else that caught her attention and ran again away. But her both 
friends knew that the tall girl would return. As soon as their meals 
would stand on the table.

&quot;Hai. It wasn&#39;t that hard.&quot; Anthy blushed and enjoyed it to lay her 
foot on the empty chair opposite to her.

&quot;Two fishes with the first tries. Utena&#39;s face was worth the extra 
money.&quot; Kei grinned diabolic and thanked the waitress as she bought 
them their meals. Utena and he ordered okonomiyaki while Anthy decided 
for a salad. &quot;Sad that I didn&#39;t have my camera to make a photo.&quot; Kei 
giggled and thanked the waitress. Then he looked around and right at 
that moment Utena returned. Of course her white jeans were now dirtied 
and because it was still hot she had opened the first buttons of her 
blue shirt. Her hairs were slightly messed and her cheeks red from the 
excitement.

She look        s cute.

Anthy watched her come. She didn&#39;t even touch her salad yet while Kei 
already enjoyed his meal. He didn&#39;t want to let it getting cold just 
because his friend decided to look around instead to eat.

&quot;For you.&quot; Said Utena while she sat down and before Anthy could react 
something hang around her neck. She looked down and her eyes grew wide 
in disbelieve. There was a gingerbread heart hanging around her neck. 
It was total kitsch but nevertheless beautiful. It showed a little 
teddy who held a big, red heart in his paws. There were some Japanese 
signs within the heart. Showing only two words. Two words that let 
Anthy blush deeply.

&gt;Love you&lt;

&quot;And I?&quot; chuckled Kei as he saw the smaller girl&#39;s reaction. Anthy was 
like hypnotised by the heart. She held it in her hands and stared with 
an unbelieving expression on her tomato like face on it.

&quot;Of course I won something for you, too.&quot; Grinned Utena and soon Kei 
held a small, pink reindeer in his hands. It squinted and looked as if 
it was dead drunk.

&quot;Great, thank you sooo much! Pink, my most favourite colour! It looks 
as if it throws up soon.&quot;

&quot;Baka!&quot;

They both grinned but showed each other their tongues - just in case.

&quot;Then let&#39;s eat!&quot; Utena grinned as Kei mumbled something that sounded 
like revenge and big, yellow elephant and wolfed her okonomiyaki into 
her growling stomach. It took her even less time than Kei who already 
ate half of his meal by the time she arrived. The restaurant was well 
visited and in the middle was a small dance floor. Some musicians sat 
down, too, and soon they started to play music. Japanese folk music, 
but also rock music and modern songs. Fast and slow songs. And some 
songs the audience wished to hear. Just like a couple that was married 
for over 50 years and wanted to hear &gt;their&lt; song. 

&quot;That&#39;s great.&quot; Whispered Utena while watching the old couple dance. 
&quot;Wonder if I&#39;ll get that old.&quot;

&quot;Not when you continue to eat that way, baka.&quot;

&quot;Jerk!&quot;

They both grinned and ordered another lemonade.

&quot;Do you want anything more? Maybe an ice cream?&quot; asked Utena and 
turned around. And froze as she saw that Anthy didn&#39;t touch her meal. 
She sat there, still staring at the gingerbread heart. &quot;Earth to 
Anthy, earth to Anthy, is anyone at home?&quot;

The smaller girl jerked out of her daydream and smiled guilty.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you hungry? Or doesn&#39;t it taste?&quot;

&quot;No, no, it&#39;s fine.&quot; Anthy took her fork shortly and started to eat. 
Slowly, very slowly. She wasn&#39;t very hungry, but she knew that Utena 
would be very concerned if she wouldn&#39;t eat at least the half of it.

&quot;Everything okay, Anthy?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;Really? And your foot?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s feeling fine.&quot; Anthy smiled her soft smile and Kei decided that 
the smaller girl needed a short time on her own. He had seen her 
reaction and wasn&#39;t sure if Utena meant it that way.

&quot;Do you wanna dance, baka?&quot; he asked as the band started to play a 
fast rock&#39;n&#39;roll song.

&quot;Even if I jump on your feet?&quot; grinned the tall girl and nodded. &quot;Of 
course I&#39;ll take that challenge.&quot; Utena shortly bowed over to Anthy 
and caressed a bronze cheek. &quot;Just tell me when you are tired and want 
to go home, okay? I mostly know no end and I don&#39;t want you to suffer 
under my crazy behaviour.&quot;

&quot;I would never, Utena.&quot; Anthy smiled and ate a small tomato. Watching 
the two going to the dance floor. Soon swirling each other around in 
the fast rhythm. They seemed to have learned it very well, because 
their steps looked correct and they didn&#39;t lose the balance once. Some 
people watched them and started to applause when they did some really 
hard moves. For example the somersault Utena did at the middle of the 
song. Of course Kei caught her back and they both grinned as he 
pretended that the tall girl was very heavy with a sudden. Utena 
knocked on his head and soon they rocked even wilder.

They are really perfect friends. I wish I would have had such a 
friend, too, when I was small.

Anthy watched them and sighed.

Just for a small time.

But now I have Utena.

Is that enough?

Is that really enough?

To be your best friend?

You want her to be someone else, right?

You liked the way she held you tight, right?

You loved the way she kissed you so gently, right?

Right?

Right?

Right?

Shut up!

But Anthy knew that the little voice inside her mind was right. So 
damn right!

The song ended and the people applauded even more as the two left the 
dance floor again. After bowing deeply.

&quot;We still can do it.&quot; Laughed Utena and took a long gulp out of her 
lemonade glass.

&quot;But you put on weights, baka.&quot;

&quot;You are only getting older and weaker, that&#39;s it.&quot;

&quot;Older? With 19?&quot;

They both continued to argue a little bit longer with grins on their 
faces while the band started another song. It was a very, very slow 
song. A love song as Utena recognized. She heard little modern music, 
but this song had been in the charts the whole summer two years ago. 
Everyone heard it somewhere so did she. Here no one sang along, but it 
sounded even better that way. Instrumental. Utena turned her head and 
glanced at Anthy who had finally put her fork away. Some more strands 
escaped her hairdo and she served herself fresh air with the fan Kei 
won for her by throwing a heavy ball at all tins.

&quot;How is your foot feeling, Anthy?&quot;

&quot;Better.&quot; Anthy smiled shyly as Utena rose again. Her hairs were 
messed from the rock&#39;n&#39;roll and still a little bit sweaty at the ends. 
Her shirt was crumbled and her blue eyes seemed to shine.

&quot;Do you wanna dance with me, Anthy? Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s a slow song, you 
won&#39;t feel sick afterwards.&quot;

&quot;Uhm...&quot; Anthy hesitated, but she couldn&#39;t say no. Not to the 
attentive smile and especially not to that look in deep eyes. She 
never would be able to say no when Utena looked at her in that 
pleading way. &quot;But I warn you that my foot is not the best right now.&quot;

&quot;What do you have to jump after chocolate bars, dummy.&quot; The dummy 
sounded so tender that Anthy had to shiver.

&quot;It was YOUR bar.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Utena took her hand and the touch let them both froze for a 
small moment. It was over before they really realized it. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
there to catch you if you stumble.&quot;

&quot;As long as you don&#39;t stumble, baka.&quot; Giggled Kei but Utena simply 
overheard his teasing words. Carefully she leaded the smaller girl 
through the tables towards the dance floor. Where some other couples 
already danced.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how to dance with my foot.&quot; Whispered Anthy and blushed. 
Utena took her right hand and wrapped her free arm around her waist. 
To hold her and to lead her.

&quot;Just move to the rhythm. This is not a competition. This should be 
fun, Anthy.&quot; Utena raised asking her eyebrows and as Anthy nodded 
slowly, very slowly they started to move. They had danced before. 
After Utena saved Anthy when Nanami tried to humiliate her. But this 
time it was completely different. Not only because Anthy could hardly 
use her injured feet and hobbled more than she danced. Not only 
because this was a different place. Not the school hall was around 
them. Not the pupils. But total strangers who didn&#39;t know them. Who 
didn&#39;t bother them. Who let them be the way they were. No one wanted 
to duel, no one was mean. And they did change. During the past weeks. 
Since they had left school to go on vacations together. &quot;Is it okay or 
shall we stop?&quot; Utena held Anthy a little bit tighter as the smaller 
girl stumbled.

&quot;No, it&#39;s fine.&quot; Anthy&#39;s voice was the same quiet, the same shaky. She 
leaned her head against the warm shoulder as they continued to move to 
the slow music. She felt how Utena gave up the traditional dance style 
and simply embraced her with both arms. How she buried her face in her 
hairs and stroke loving over her back. Anthy enjoyed it. It was alike 
to her how much her foot started to hurt. It was alike to her that she 
was dead tired. It was alike to her if she felt so damn dizzy. To be 
here, next to her Utena, that was all that counted.

I love you so much.

But she didn&#39;t dare to say it aloud. Maybe Kei was right. But maybe he 
was wrong. Maybe...

And the kiss?

And this dance?

Doesn&#39;t it mean anything? Something? At least for her?

Anthy didn&#39;t know. But she knew that she wouldn&#39;t want this dance to 
stop. To be so near to her Utena, it was an incredible feeling. Deeper 
than every feeling she thought she would feel at school. Because Utena 
was her groom, was engaged to her. Here she was a normal girl, there 
were no duels and no stupid student council. Over the weeks that 
feeling Anthy had felt deep in her heart when Utena won her, deepened 
and grew stronger. With every day that passed by. With every smile 
from the tall girl. With every comforting and so tender gesture. Just 
like her now stroking through her strands. Caressing her neck. It was 
so nice. So wonderful...

At that moment Anthy stumbled hard and couldn&#39;t find back her balance. 
She felt how she fell and was caught up by two strong arms.

&quot;Anthy? Everything okay?&quot; concern was in Utena&#39;s voice and all Anthy 
could do was to nod. Her foot hurt too much to stand on it any longer. 
Her body trembled from the effort and she gulped. She didn&#39;t want to 
end that dance, that gentle touch, but she knew that it was over. She 
felt how she was lifted into the air and how Utena carried her over to 
her chair. How she let her sit down carefully.

&quot;Gomen, I should have seen that it&#39;s too exhausting for you, Anthy.&quot; 
Whispered Utena as she knelt down before her. To look right into the 
pale face. Seeing the tired expression there. &quot;Gomen, Anthy.&quot;

Kei raised asking his eyebrows. It was the first time that he heard 
Utena begging so openly for forgiveness. Mostly you had to let her 
fight against an army to let her look as defeated as right now.

When did she become so calm?

&quot;It was a wonderful dance, Utena. Arigato.&quot; Anthy smiled one of her 
soft smiles and brushed some sweaty pink hairs out of a sweaty face.

Kei got his answer as Utena blushed slightly.

***

&quot;Nani? You don&#39;t want to come with us?&quot; 

Utena looked puzzled as Kei closed the cabin door. It was past 
midnight and the firework would start soon. They wanted to look at it 
from the top of the Ferris wheel.

&quot;No. It&#39;s too high for me. Besides I have to take care of those two 
guys.&quot; He held the fishes into the air and winked as they moved. 
Slowly the ground disappeared and they felt how they were lifted into 
the air. One turn with the Ferris wheel took almost one hour. Enough 
time to watch the park illuminated by night. And to watch the firework 
that would begin soon.

&quot;It&#39;s nice here.&quot; Said Anthy but couldn&#39;t hold back a yawn. She was 
very tired and trembled a little bit. The idea of going back through 
the whole city to get to Utena aunt&#39;s house wasn&#39;t very temping. Now 
not only her foot hurt, but also her legs. She was simply exhausted. 
But she simply couldn&#39;t have say no when Utena discovered the Ferris 
wheel and found out that the firework would start soon.

&quot;Are you tired, Anthy?&quot;

&quot;A little bit.&quot; Admitted the bronze girl and yawned again. With tired 
eyes she stared out of the night through the glass windows, still 
feeling the cabin move.

&quot;Come over here, Anthy.&quot; Invited Utena and clapped on the place next 
to her. Now they still sat opposite so Anthy hesitated.

&quot;Come on, Anthy. You aren&#39;t a chocolate bar. I won&#39;t bite.&quot;

But you are as sweet as one.

Utena blushed and was happy that it was dark in the cabin. She blushed 
too often during the past weeks but she couldn&#39;t hold it back. No 
matter how hard she fought against it.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Anthy sat down and screamed silently as suddenly two hands 
grabbed her arms and pulled her backwards. Before she could react, she 
laid on the bank, her head in Utena&#39;s lap. The cabin swung for a 
moment dangerous but they both didn&#39;t notice it at all.

Purple eyes looked asking into blue ones. Then Utena started to open 
Anthy&#39;s hairs and stroke through the violet curls.

&quot;If you want to sleep a little bit, do so.&quot;

&quot;But the firework...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just a simple firework, Anthy.&quot;

The bronze girl gulped. It was simply to nice here. She didn&#39;t want to 
fall asleep. Because then the ride on the Ferris wheel would be over 
too soon. There were only two more weeks left. So short weeks. And 
then she had to go back to that school. Being the Rose Bride again. 
Being afraid with every duel that she would lose Utena.

Anthy smiled tiredly about her strange thought.

No, she would be the one who would have to go to someone else. Utena 
would lose her, so why did she think about it the other way around?

Who knew when they would ever have the change again to go to such a 
festival? Anthy raised her hand and touched the gingerbread heart. 
When would she ever feel so happy again?

She felt how another warm hand covered her own one and held it over 
the heart tight. Neither of them spoke. They simply looked out of the 
window and stared at the stars. Anthy still struggling with her sleepy 
body.

&quot;Sleep, Anthy.&quot;

&quot;But....&quot; Anthy&#39;s eyes filled with tears and she turned her head a 
little bit away. &quot;But when I might wake up it was all a dream and I am 
still at school.&quot; She whispered almost inaudible. Utena&#39;s blue eyes 
grew wide and her hand rested for a moment in her curls before she 
kept stroking.

&quot;You won&#39;t, Anthy.&quot; She answered finally very silent, wiping away two 
little tears that escaped purple eyes. &quot;Just sleep a little bit. I&#39;ll 
be there.&quot; The tall girl leaned forward and kissed Anthy&#39;s forehead. 
The way she had done during the bad thunderstorm. This was not a 
lover&#39;s kiss. It was completely different from the one Anthy got 
earlier this evening in the tree&#39;s shadows. But it was comforting. It 
warmed her heart and made her feel safe and secure. She let the sleep 
take control over her body while Utena&#39;s soft stroking hands 
accompanied her into the dreamland.

For a long time Utena looked into the relaxed face. Into such a 
beautiful face.

You like her a lot, right?

Right?

Right?

Right?

More than you have ever liked someone before in your life. More than 
you have liked Ayani or Kei or Wakaba, right? She is something 
special. For you. Right?

Right?

Right?

Right?

Utena sighed and played with one strand. Feeling how the cabin swung 
slightly. The firework started to explode in the dark night&#39;s sky, 
turning it into a coloured paradise. Utena didn&#39;t look up. She wasn&#39;t 
even interested in it any longer. She only glanced down at the girl in 
her lap and smiled tenderly.

Right, she is someone special.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Anthy, whenever you will wake up, I&#39;ll be there.&quot;

It sounded like a silent promise.

***

Two fishes swam happily in their new home. The moon shone down to the 
water, was reflected on its surface. Two shadows stood besides the 
little pond on the now wet grass.

&quot;Anthy?&quot; Utena hesitated. But then she stepped closer and embraced the 
smaller girl who trembled. Because of the fresh wind playing with her 
opened hairs and because of her own tiredness. They called a taxi 
after they left the Ferris wheel and the bronze girl slept the whole 
time while the driver brought them home.

&quot;Hm?&quot; the voice was husky and full with sleep. Anthy wanted to get 
into bed quickly, but first she had to free the cute little fishes she 
won. The evening had been fantastic and soon they forgot Ayani&#39;s 
hurting words. &quot;You looked beautiful tonight, Anthy.&quot; Whispered Utena 
and blushed deeply. She buried her face in soft hairs on a small 
shoulder. Smelling Anthy&#39;s sweet scent. &quot;I like you very much, Anthy.&quot; 
Her voice was very silent but Anthy understood her very well. Her 
heart beat increased and she gulped.

Does she mean it the way she says it?

The smaller girl raised her head and looked directly into sparkling 
blue eyes. She felt how Utena raised her right hand and caressed her 
cheeks. Wiping away two small tears.

No or never!

This is your chance before you have to return to that school.

To say it as Anthy, not as Rose Bride!

Just do it, she feels the same.

Doesn&#39;t she?

Doesn&#39;t she?

Utena smiled and took away all of Anthy&#39;s doubts.

&quot;I love you, too.&quot; Answered the bronze girl and laid her heart in 
Utena&#39;s hands. Whatever she wanted to do with it, she could do it. She 
could hold it and take care for it. But she could also throw it away.

Utena took a deep breath and suddenly her eyes watered, too.

&quot;Are those the words of my Anthy or of the Rose Bride?&quot; she asked with 
a shaky voice and took a deep breath. Squeezing the girl in her arms 
tighter.

My Anthy...

The smaller girl smiled one of those soft smiles and raised her hands. 
To mess pink strands. To caress Utena&#39;s neck, her cheeks and her 
temples. Utena closed her eyes and let her do it. Enjoyed it although 
her stomach hurt. What was when Anthy answered that it was her duty to 
love her? Because they were engaged? Because it was simply her destiny 
as Rose Bride to love whoever was her groom?

&quot;Dummy.&quot; Giggled Anthy silently and rested her hands behind Utena&#39;s 
back of the heard. &quot;Of course as Anthy. The girl you took on vacations 
with you. The girl you shared one room at school. The only girl you 
accepted to be your best friend. Anthy, not the Rose Bride.&quot;

The Rose Bride is a title, a duty, maybe even my destiny, but my real 
self, the girl behind the mask is still Himemiya Anthy.

Anthy knew that she had to thank Utena for that knowledge one day. 
Even if it took her over sixteen years to see it.

&quot;&gt;I&lt; love you, Utena.&quot;

Utena.

Not Tenjoh-san.

They both looked deep into each other&#39;s eyes and Utena wasn&#39;t even 
ashamed of some tears escaping her eyes. She felt how Anthy pulled her 
head down. She didn&#39;t fight against it. She only held her tighter 
against her trembling body as their lips finally met again. It was a 
little bit like their first kiss just some hours ago. But the same 
time it was completely different. It was more passionate. And surer. 
Because they knew about each other&#39;s feelings.

There were so many questions left: What should they do when they 
returned to school in only some days. 13 days... too less days... What 
should they do during the next duel? How should they live with the 
whole situation when they were closer to each other. When they were 
together... a couple... in love...

But those questions didn&#39;t matter. At least not right in that moment. 
Not at that night. It wouldn&#39;t play a role during the following days. 
They had enough time to think about them... later. A lot later. Until 
then, everything that still existed in their suddenly little world was 
the other one.

Tenderly they held each other tight and kissed. A long kiss that 
didn&#39;t seem to find an end. None of them wanted to break it. Not after 
it had take them so long to find each other.

I will never let you go, Anthy. Never again.

Maybe the smaller girl wasn&#39;t the prince on a shinning horse Utena had 
waited for her whole childhood. But now she grew up and now she was 
that prince instead. And Anthy the princess.

It was their second kiss. It lasted longer than their first one. It 
lasted the whole night.

***

&quot;Chu chu!&quot;

Rinja stepped next to the little pet who sat on the window-seat and 
stared outside to the nightly garden. The tall woman only had to take 
one look to recognize the shadows standing there. Near the pond. In a 
deep embracement.

&quot;Let&#39;s go to bed, Chu chu. It&#39;s late at night and our two found their 
way home, okay?&quot;

The brown animal chu chu&#39;ed again and followed the young woman who 
smiled into the darkness while she crept under her soft blanket. Happy 
that her niece found someone. And that this someone was Anthy. A nice 
girl who would never let her down.

I wish you all the best, you two.



Epilogue: Wishes granted

Anthy felt how her school uniform changed as she walked upstairs. The 
long staircase that would lead her towards the duelling platform. It 
was now only two days that school started again. That they returned 
from Utena&#39;s aunt&#39;s home. Of course Toga used his chance to challenge 
her and of course Utena had to agree. She would never lose another 
duel again, because that would have meant to lose Anthy. She didn&#39;t 
want to ever let her go again. The bronze girl had been really 
depressed after Toga went away and cried the whole night. Saying again 
and again that this summer had been too short. That she didn&#39;t want to 
go to Toga. That she loved Utena too much to ever leave her.

I simply have to win.

As ever!

Utena reached the platform and saw her girlfriend&#39;s pale face. Knowing 
that she had to get that sword out of her body now. To face Toga and 
to fight against him.

I am so damn tired of all those duels. It&#39;s not even a week that we 
returned from vacations and I already feel so damn exhausted!

But Utena knew that she would went through hell - as long as her Anthy 
was by her side.

&quot;Utena?&quot; Anthy&#39;s voice was shaking.

Damn! I want so badly to be a normal girl! To have a relationship with 
her without that fear and that sorrow! Without the concern of losing 
her.

Damn! That summer had been too short. I had been normal. For just one 
summer... eight weeks, two months. 

The time had been too less. Much too less!

Please, let the summer start again. Please!

But she knew that she couldn&#39;t turn back time. All she could do was to 
hope and pray that Utena wouldn&#39;t lose the duel. That they could go 
back to their room and to forget about all this stuff. Even if it was 
only for some hours. While doing their homework, while preparing and 
eating supper, while sleeping. In each other&#39;s embracement.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Anthy. I won&#39;t let you go.&quot; Utena bowed, but instead of 
pulling the sword out, she kissed her girlfriend. Loving. With so much 
passion. &quot;Never again, my love.&quot;

***

&quot;I can&#39;t believe that Toga really dropped his sword.&quot; Giggled Utena as 
she stepped into the shower. Anthy already washed her hairs and 
grinned at her. Half blind because her glasses laid on the room&#39;s 
table.

&quot;The look of his face when you kissed me was worth it.&quot; Replied the 
smaller girl and wrapped her arms around Utena&#39;s slim waist. Stroking 
over the soft skin of her back.

&quot;Shall I wash you hairs, Utena?&quot; she offered and Utena lowered her 
head. Enjoying she started to purr as she felt her girlfriend&#39;s hands 
in her pink strands.

I wish I was a normal girl again. And if it would be for just one 
summer. One more summer.

But the same time Anthy knew that she was a normal girl. For her 
girlfriend she would always be Himemiya, her love. Not the Rose Bride. 
She was incredible happy about that thought.

&quot;Anthy?&quot; asked Utena after her hairs were washed. &quot;What did you wish 
when you saw all the shooting stars?&quot; She opened her eyes and saw how 
the smaller girl smiled that soft smile she only smiled at her. Purple 
eyes sparkled and Anthy raised her hands once more. But not to clean 
her hairs this time, but to bring her face nearer to hers. The smaller 
girl stepped on her tiptoes and kissed her lightly on her lips.

&quot;It was granted, Utena. Believe me, some wishes are still granted.&quot;

Utena smiled tenderly and embraced her girlfriend. To pull her nearer 
her body. She rested her forehead against the bronze one and smiled 
loving. Remembering all the tender moments they shared during the past 
two weeks. During the whole vacations. Knowing that they had to do 
such vacations again. Soon. Maybe during the autumn vacations and 
surely during Christmas. This was not their last term at school, but 
they both knew that they would hold on each other until they were able 
to leave that school. Together. Forever.

&quot;I am happy for you and your wish.&quot; Whispered Utena and kissed her 
again. With much more passion this time.

I love you, Anthy.

I love you, Utena.

As I am happy that my own wish was granted, too. 

------------------------------------------------------------

One last disclaimer: The funny guys Utena and Anthy are watching at TV 
at the night of the thunderstorm are of course Monty Phyton&#39;s Flying 
Circus. But I am sure you all recognized them.

So, this was now my own attempt of writing an Utena fanfic. Don&#39;t 
blame me that I left out a lot of characters (guess everyone except 
Utena and Anthy and... well... Toga, but, does he really count? ^-^) 
or that I might have changed some storyline. This is a fanFICTION and 
it is my right to change some details ^-^.

I simply like the idea that Utena and Anthy would be a perfect couple. 
If you didn&#39;t like that... hey, I warned you in the beginning. Maybe I 
am simply too romantic ^-^. I know some episodes of the anime and 
finally also the movie (thank you, Link ^-^), but I think that such an 
all day story could have happened, as well. 

Oh... about grammar, the ones who ever had or still have a pet, know 
how deep the feelings can be towards that pet. It belongs to the 
family and is a part of it. I know that it&#39;s better grammar to write 
about a pet as &gt;it&lt;, but Chuchu is more than just a pet. He&#39;s Anthy&#39;s 
best friend at the beginning, and so I referred him as &gt;him&lt; or &gt;he&lt;. 
For those who never knew the luck of having pets, just accept it. 
Okay?

So much to my vacations idea. Hope you liked it. Thank you for reading 
and, Adri-chan, was it okay that way?

^-^.
