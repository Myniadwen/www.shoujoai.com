<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Reloaded (part 3 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/bshbreload-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Wakaba paced the musty smelling old bedroom, her pretty brown eyes dark 
with worry. The girl&#39;s school uniform hugged her slim form, her brown 
hair bouncing against the back of her neck. &quot;Oh Utena,&quot; she finally 
sighed aloud, &quot;where are you?&quot;

There was a odd scratching noise from just outside and Wakaba spun 
around towards the open window. Utena pushed it open and climbed inside 
the room, her pink hair falling into robin&#39;s egg blue eyes. Her boy&#39;s 
school uniform was splattered with blood, red marring the smooth black 
cloth, a few spots standing out boldly on Utena&#39;s pale face.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; a tiredly smiling Utena anticipated the question as 
Wakaba rushed over to her side, &quot;none of this blood is mine.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Wakaba asked, the smaller girl beginning to unbutton 
Utena&#39;s stained jacket, her nose wrinkling at the smell of the dark 
blood.

&quot;Akio was having one of his little parties,&quot; Utena hissed angrily.

Wakaba delicately helped Utena shrug her black jacket off as she asked 
her curiously, &quot;Were the other vampires there?&quot;

&quot;Most of the old student council,&quot; Utena nodded, &quot;there with Akio 
playing his debauched games.&quot; She closed her eyes, more quietly adding, 
&quot;He&#39;s dead.&quot;

Wakaba looked up at her in gentle concern, hearing the mixed emotions in 
her voice. &quot;It&#39;s not easy, is it?&quot; she asked.

Utena nodded slightly, standing there topless, her almost bone pale skin 
glowing slightly in the near darkness. &quot;I remember that they were human 
once,&quot; she murmured, &quot;but there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.&quot; A red tear 
glistened as it slid down her ghostly cheek, with another drop of blood 
trailing after it only a moment later.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Wakaba asked, her eyes widening in alarm.

Utena wiped at a tear, bright red streaking her palm. &quot;I thought,&quot; her 
voice dropped to a painful whisper, &quot;that with him gone, it would be... 
over, finally. But it isn&#39;t over, it won&#39;t be until I&#39;m finally killed 
somehow....&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say things like that,&quot; Wakaba stepped forward as Utena&#39;s legs 
gave out, the smaller girl dropping to her knees to hold Utena close. 
Hot tears fell against her own cheek as she cradled the taller woman, 
murmuring gentle words of reassurance. Even as she did Wakaba silently 
cursed her body, feeling it responding to having Utena so close to her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Utena finally pulled back a bit, giving Wakaba a 
heartbreakingly sad smile, &quot;I hate it when I&#39;m so weak.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not weak,&quot; Wakaba answered firmly, meeting Utena&#39;s deep blue 
eyes, &quot;you&#39;re the strongest woman I know.&quot; She gently swept some of 
Utena&#39;s long hair back from her face, &quot;When I think of what could have 
happened when you were first changed....&quot;

They remained there kneeling on the floor for a unknown length of time, 
the noises of the far off dorms coming to life finally pushing them to 
action. &quot;You&#39;d better get going,&quot; Utena said as she rose, tugging Wakaba 
up to her feet, &quot;the sun will rise soon and I need to sleep.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Wakaba looked up at Utena then she smiled slightly, &quot;but 
I&#39;ll be back here tonight to check up on you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena flashed her one of her rare smiles.

Wakaba walked over to the bedroom door, stopping to look back as she 
opened the door into the dark hall just beyond. Utena had slipped her 
black shoes off, her matching pants sliding down over those rounded 
hips. Her plain white panties hugged her bottom, then she slid her 
fingers into the waistband and drew them down.

Biting back a sudden moan Wakaba slid the door shut then hurried down 
the hall, only stopping once she was out of the abandoned dorm, the 
first light of dawn breaking over the remote campus of Ohtori academy. 
Her cheeks flamed as she fought down the surging waves of desire, doing 
her best to banish the pleasant memory of Utena pressed so close to her. 
Only when her breath came a bit more evenly did she start out walking 
once again.

&quot;Good morning, Wakaba,&quot; the quiet voice murmured and Wakaba turned to 
see the young woman walking from the woods nearby. Kozue Kaoru smiled 
slightly, her blue hair falling into her eyes as she murmured, &quot;You 
look... tense.&quot;

Wakaba studied her, noting how badly rumpled her skirt was. &quot;You 
weren&#39;t....?&quot; she asked, already suspecting the answer.

Kozue just chuckled, a decidedly wicked sound. &quot;What better way to start 
a morning?&quot; she asked with that dangerous smile. She moved a little 
closer to Wakaba, the scent that was wafting from her earthy and almost 
entirely sexual.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you,&quot; Wakaba shook her head, her cheeks coloring as she 
blushed under the other girl&#39;s very amused gaze. She knew about Kozue&#39;s 
reputation as a bit of a slut but this was a little much, even for her.

&quot;I&#39;m honest about myself and my desires,&quot; the smiling Kozue brushed 
leaves off her bottom, her motion twisting her body with a predatory 
grace, &quot;unlike certain people.&quot;

Wakaba just knew she shouldn&#39;t respond but she did, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Kozue stepped towards her, her dark eyes looking into Wakaba&#39;s with 
surprising warmth. &quot;I know you&#39;re still carrying a torch for your 
roommate,&quot; she reached out to put her hand on the skin at the base of 
Wakaba&#39;s throat, &quot;but she&#39;s gone, has been for weeks.&quot; Kozue slid 
closer, her sweet scented breath warm on her cheek, &quot;You have needs, you 
know.&quot;

Wakaba gulped, astonished at the depths of hunger in Kozue&#39;s eyes. &quot;So 
what would you suggest?&quot; she croaked out.

Kozue slid her hand down as she brought her lips up to Wakaba&#39;s ear. Her 
one hand weighed a cloth covered breast as she cooed, &quot;I could always 
miss my morning classes.&quot;

Wakaba moaned softly, Kozue&#39;s tongue flicking out to wet her ear before 
the other girl bit gently, tugging at her earlobe. Suddenly both of her 
hands were on Wakaba&#39;s breasts, cupping the orbs as she slid her lips 
across to hers, pulling her into a deep kiss. Pointy nipples were tugged 
forcefully through the cloth and Wakaba mewled, desire surging.

&quot;Well?&quot; Kozue drew back from the kiss, licking at her puffy lips.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Wakaba found herself whispering.

They ended up in Kozue&#39;s room only a few minutes later, she gently 
sitting Wakaba on the edge of the bed before slipping into the shower. 
&quot;Why did you...?&quot; Wakaba asked as Kozue emerged clean a few moments 
later, drying her hair with one towel and another wrapped around her.

Kozue studied Wakaba for a moment, weighing her answer. &quot;I can&#39;t be pure 
for you,&quot; she finally said seriously, &quot;though I may want to be, but at 
least I can be clean.&quot;

&quot;What...&quot; Wakaba blinked.

The blue towel slipped from around Kozue&#39;s body, falling to the floor as 
she casually dropped the other. Her slim body glistened with a sheen of 
water, her youthful breasts and skin glowing with health, and her body 
was entirely shaved clean. She sauntered towards the now wide-eyed 
Wakaba, purring out the question, &quot;Do you like it?&quot;

Wakaba gulped, reaching out to touch shaven flesh that already shone 
wetly, a heady scent filling the air. &quot;It&#39;s lovely,&quot; she looked up at 
Kozue breathlessly.

Kozue moved like a cat, pushing the still dressed Wakaba over onto her 
back. &quot;You&#39;re a little overdressed,&quot; she purred catlike too, pulling at 
Wakaba&#39;s shirt and swiftly casting it aside. The skirt was yanked down 
Wakaba&#39;s very willing body, leaving her in matching lace bra and 
panties.

&quot;Don&#39;t stop now,&quot; Wakaba gasped, her nipples thrusting up through the 
cloth, the crotch of her panties soaked.

&quot;I wonder what your Utena would have thought of seeing you in something 
like this?&#39; Kozue moaned in her ear, laying above Wakaba and sliding 
their bodies wetly together.

Wakaba&#39;s eyes flashed with desire, her hands moving to embrace the woman 
laying over her. She began to bump they hips together, rubbing at 
Kozue&#39;s bare cunt with the scratchy lace, Wakaba&#39;s hands reaching around 
to clasp her bare bottom possessively.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Kozue moaned and twisted violently as they ground together, 
clearly surprised by Wakaba&#39;s sudden aggressiveness. She arched her back 
as excitement and the teasing overwhelmed her, coming with a throaty 
cry.

Wakaba shuddered, soaking her panties even more as she came as well. 
&quot;God,&quot; she panted, slumping backwards.

Kozue snuggled beside her sweaty lover, her voice surprisingly gentle as 
she said, &quot;I&#39;m not used to someone taking care of me, first.&quot; She 
reached out to gently toy with Wakaba&#39;s curly hair, &quot;Or having someone 
come with me.&quot;

Wakaba looked over at Kozue languidly, &quot;I got a little carried away.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m not feeling too tired,&quot; Kozue licked some of Wakaba&#39;s sweat 
away gently as she said, &quot;and I think it&#39;s my turn....&quot;

It was late afternoon before the two of them ended up in the shower, 
washing the day&#39;s activity away. Wakaba winced slightly as Kozue washed 
her back, the red marks of sharp fingernails left on her slim shoulders. 
&quot;Every time we do this I tell myself it will be the last time,&quot; Wakaba 
said, &quot;but I keep coming back.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;d miss you if you did,&quot; Kozue said as she rinsed Wakaba&#39;s 
back. She leaned forward to press her body up against her and her lips 
to the red marks, &quot;Sorry about that.&quot;

Wakaba shuddered slightly, a low moan coming from her throat. &quot;Don&#39;t do 
that,&quot; she scolded, &quot;or we&#39;re never going to get out of here.&quot;

Kozue chuckled softly but she pulled back a bit. &quot;And that would be bad 
because?&quot; she asked curiously, taking some shampoo to do Wakaba&#39;s hair.

&quot;You&#39;re insatiable,&quot; Wakaba quietly laughed, enjoying the other woman&#39;s 
touch.

Kozue rinsed Wakaba&#39;s hair as she mused, &quot;I wonder sometimes why I still 
go out with the boys, considering what happens with you.&quot; Before Wakaba 
could say anything she added, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m being safe, I&#39;m the condom 
queen.&quot; She chuckled wickedly, &quot;And I don&#39;t swallow.&quot;

Wakaba choked a moment, recovering enough to say, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you 
said that.&quot;

Kozue just chuckled warmly, &quot;You can be such an innocent.&quot;
