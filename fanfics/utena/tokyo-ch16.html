<h1>Blood Soaked and Honor Bound: Tokyo (part 16 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/tokyo-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>        Utena paused in the doorway as she was leaving the bedroom, 
the black clad girl looking back at the soundly sleeping Wakaba 
laying there naked on the bed. &#39;We tired her out, poor thing,&#39; Utena 
thought as she stepped out into the hallway.

        Juri was leaning up against the kitchen counter when Utena 
went in, talking to Ruka. &quot;Were you the one who gave her that idea?&quot; 
Juri asked him, her long orange hair flowing down her back. She wore 
a cream colored suit, hugging her shapely body.

        &quot;I may have made a suggestion or two,&quot; Ruka offered. The 
blue haired young man smiled slightly, &quot;I hope things turned out 
well?&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Utena&#39;s quiet voice badly startled him, coming 
up behind him almost silently with her vampire gifts.

        &quot;Gah,&quot; Ruka nearly spilled the saucepan, but he recovered 
quickly. &quot;Do that again and you don&#39;t eat,&quot; he scolded her good 
naturedly.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Utena gave him a smile.

        &quot;Do you think Wakaba will want something to eat once she 
recovers?&quot; Ruka asked curiously, obviously considering what he could 
make for the girl.

        &quot;Once she wakes up,&quot; Juri agreed. She looked over at 
Utena, &quot;The party is later tonight. Do you think anything will 
happen?&quot;

        &quot;It will almost have to,&quot; Utena said grimly. She smiled 
then, a dangerous little smile, &quot;But I won&#39;t run and hide from this.&quot;

        &quot;Well, that&#39;s fair enough,&quot; Juri agreed with a wicked smile 
all of her own, &quot;as long as we&#39;re ready for what comes.&quot;

        &quot;We will be,&quot; Utena said firmly, her skin bone pale, the 
long pink hair bold resting there up against her cheek

        &quot;You know,&quot; Juri gave Utena a thoughtful look, &quot;I think 
you&#39;re the most beautiful when you&#39;re being the most dangerous.&quot;

        Oddly, Utena didn&#39;t even try to deny it. Instead she quietly 
said, &quot;You may be right, Juri. At least I&#39;m not hiding it anymore.&quot;

        The packets of blood Ruka was warming up were blood 
temperature at last, so he handed them one each in little bowls, 
putting another aside for Shiori. &quot;When do you want us to get ready 
for the party?&quot; Ruka asked them softly.

        &quot;Get something to eat,&quot; Juri sat down with her packet at the 
dining- room table, &quot;then start getting ready. I think Ayeka said we 
start about midnight.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s kinda theatrical,&quot; Wakaba stumbled in, her eyes 
still cloudy with sleep. She looked around before plaintively 
asking, &quot;Coffee?&quot;

        &quot;Here you go,&quot; Ruka passed the cup over with a smile.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Wakaba drank some of it down with a happy sigh. 
She looked, meeting Utena&#39;s loving gaze and blushed slightly. Then 
she gazed to the other side and took in Juri&#39;s frankly lusty gaze 
and shivered deliciously.

        &quot;Have a good night?&quot; Ruka chuckled.

        &quot;You have no idea,&quot; Wakaba murmured.

        &quot;Good morning, Juri-sama,&quot; Shiori slinked into the room, her 
nearly transparent night gown revealing almost all of her charms. 
Wakaba blushed, looking away as the purple haired girl&#39;s eyes lit up 
on seeing the blood packet waiting for her, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        &quot;Are you looking forward to tonight?&quot; Juri asked as Ruka 
passed the warmed blood packet over to Shiori.

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Shiori smiled as she tore the packet open, feeding 
on the red blood eagerly. Quietly she added, &quot;More than ever.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll start getting the girl&#39;s ready for tonight.&quot; Ruka 
pushed off from the kitchen counter, &quot;then get us mere mortals some 
breakfast made.&quot; He tiled his head to the side and asked, &quot;Should we 
arm ourselves for the party?&quot;

        &quot;I talked to Ayeka Kisaragi about the club we&#39;re going to,&quot; 
Utena said thoughtfully as she drank from her blood packet, &quot;she 
said they had pretty good security there. Of course, how that&#39;ll 
fare against vampires I don&#39;t know.&quot;

        &quot;We can always bust up some chairs or something,&quot; Juri 
shrugged slightly, &quot;instant wooden stakes, more or less.&quot;

        &quot;It should be a hell of a night,&quot; Shiori murmured with a 
little smile, thoughtfully watching Ruka leave the kitchen.

        In another part of the dark city, Mrs. Ohtori smiled to 
herself slightly. She could feel Shiori&#39;s anticipation rising, her 
eagerness that they be reunited. It was something she found she 
wanted, too, with a deep hunger growing within her.

        &quot;Soon,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori murmured.

        Mrs. Ohtori moved onward, pale and naked, across the 
luxurious uptown apartment to the closet, flowing by the slumbering 
woman laying on the bed. A bit of red marked the sleeping lady&#39;s 
throat, a bit of blood spotting the orbs of her full breasts. She 
paused, looking down at the woman thoughtfully, but she was well fed.

        The black dress was silken in Mrs. Ohtori&#39;s white hands, a 
black as dark as the night itself. &#39;Yes, this was fitting,&#39; she 
mused. She slid her body into the tight gown, letting the skirt hug 
her long legs, brushing her long blue hair back. A golden belt in 
chain links, then a cameo on a ribbon of back velvet was secured at 
her neck.

        &quot;I want to look good for her,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori realized, a 
little smile gently tugging at her full, red lips. It was an odd 
feeling, but not unpleasant.

        She walked over to one of the patio windows, gazing out into 
the night. Mrs. Ohtori fully intended to claim her bride Shiori 
tonight, but she was wise enough to know that she wasn&#39;t going to be 
unopposed in this. Utena and her allies would be waiting for her, 
and it was quite possible that things could come down to a fight.

        Closing her eyes the blue haired woman reached out with her 
mind into the night, touching on those that she had fed from. Some 
Mrs. Ohtori had transformed into vampires like herself, others she 
had bound to her in blood, but all would answer her call.

        &quot;Utena may have her army,&quot; Mrs. Ohtori murmured to herself 
with a satisfied smile, &quot;but I will have mine there, too.&quot;

        It would be a most interesting night, of that Mrs. Ohtori 
was sure.

        The hotel was high class, one of the very best in the city. 
In her suite Integra Hellsing calmly adjusted her burgandy tie, the 
silver cross there gleaming in the light. Her dark gray suit hugged 
her slim form, going with the almost white of her long hair. 
Adjusting her glasses Integra called out, &quot;Are you ready to go yet?&quot;

        &quot;Ready,&quot; the blonde said coolly as she walked in from the 
bathroom. Victoria wore the dark blue of the Royal Order&#39;s dress 
uniform, and Integra found her eyes tracing up the long pants and 
shirt, soaking up the handsome form.

        &quot;How do I look?&quot; Anthy asked as she came in after Victoria. 
The business suit that the dusky woman wore hugged her slim body, 
her eyes twinkling with amusement. She turned in a small circle, the 
rose suit oddly fitting with her violet hair and dark skin.

        &quot;You look marvelous,&quot; Integra&#39;s voice was husky.

        &quot;You can say that again,&quot; Victoria said with a slight smile. 
She sighed softly, &quot;It&#39;s too bad we don&#39;t have more time before we 
have to go.&quot;

        A slight blush touched Anthy&#39;s cheeks, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She took 
a deep breath, more out of reflex than any need, &quot;You don&#39;t need to 
come along with me tonight..&quot;

        &quot;I know that,&quot; Integra gently cupped Anthy&#39;s cheek, &quot;but I 
want to.&quot;

        &quot;And if things are going to get harry,&quot; Victoria pulled out 
a surprisingly large pistol, a loaner from Arucard, &quot;you may need us 
there.&quot;

        &quot;May I?&quot; Anthy extended her hand. Victoria put the gun and 
clip into her hands, Anthy slapping the clip into place then making 
sure a bullet was in the chamber. &quot;I can take care of myself,&quot; she 
hefted the gun confidently, &quot;but I&#39;d appreciate the help.&quot;

        &quot;All right,&quot; Integra nodded. Her eyes narrowed, &quot;And I want 
to meet your Utena, too.&quot;

        &quot;Just don&#39;t do anything rash,&quot; Anthy softly cautioned her as 
she passed the unloaded gun back to Victoria.

        &quot;Would I do that?&quot; Integra smiled slightly.

        &quot;In a minute,&quot; Victoria said, &quot;that&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;m 
coming along.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Anthy murmured with a slight smile.

        &quot;Well,&quot; Integra opened the front door, a slight smile on her 
aristocratic face, &quot;let&#39;s go out to this club, we&#39;ve got an 
appointment with Tenjou Utena.&quot;

        &quot;And probably Mrs. Ohtori,&quot; Anthy stepped outside into the 
hall.

        &quot;Well, I&#39;ve got the party favors if we need them,&quot; Victoria 
smoothly slid both silvery cannons away invisibly into her dress 
jacket.
