<h1>Kakumei no Bara (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tanuki.html">Tanuki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/kakubara-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Arisagawa Juri was known as many things, a few of which can&#39;t be 
mentioned for proprieties sake. However, the most popular title for her 
was &quot;The Panther.&quot; So dubbed because of her dangerous strength and 
beauty. The members of the fencing club were hard pressed to ever 
remember a time where she showed weakness. Of course, when they did 
remember, the same name always came up.

&quot;Shiori&quot;

Of course, that name was not even dared to be spoken in the presence of 
the panther herself for fear for health and safety. For if you did, 
destiny called you to the presence of Juri during practice and she was 
rarely gentle with those who dared utter the condemned name.

&quot;It&#39;s said she even made a girl cry one time.&quot;

Of late though, the members noticed a definite change in their captain. 
A ghost of a smile on her usually hard face. A softer voice when 
scolding a fencer on their technique. In other words, something had 
taken the edge off of the panther, and that scared the students of 
Ohtori more than even her icy glare could.

Today&#39;s practice was not unlike many others. Juri stood on the field 
waiting as opponent after opponent came up to challenge her, only to 
either be disarmed or to have the tip of her blade effortlessly placed 
at their chest.

&quot;Next!&quot;

The next fencer to come up came and took up their stance. Juri noted 
how calm she was, as if this one did not know her reputation. She would 
have to change that. She bowed and prepared to strike. The whistle 
chimed and she struck. Her first strike was deflected and her opponent 
countered with a strike of her own. Juri stopped it only inches from 
her chest protector and tried again. Whoever this was, they did know 
what they were doing and that fact elated Juri like a drug. Of course, 
she still had a reputation to keep, so the first chance she saw she 
struck. Juri not only disarmed her opponent when her grip was slack, 
but presented to tip of her sword to her facemask. Drawing back smugly; 
Juri removed her facemask and prompted her opponent to do the same. 
When the facemask was removed, the beaming face of Takeutski Shiori was 
presented to her amazed clubmates.

&quot;Kind of like pinning a butterfly to a board, ne Juri-san&quot;

&quot;Yeah, kinda. You&#39;re form is good, but you need to work on how you hold 
your sword.&quot;

Shiori&#39;s eyebrow shot up at that and she smiled seductively at Juri. 
Juri for her part tried to ignore how she tried to turn it into an 
innuendo and continued her advice.

&quot;Come back after classes and we&#39;ll work on it.&quot;

&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll come back later and you can help me learn how to hold my 
sword.&quot;

Juri merely smirked and whapped Shiori in her padded butt with her 
sword as she passes. The fencing club had never been more terrified in 
their lives.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Kyouchi Sayonji sat in the kendo room, waiting. He was not known for 
his patience, but for this one student he would wait forever. His 
practice sword was bouncing impatiently on his shoulder, the only sign 
of how long he had actually been waiting. In truth it had only been 
minutes. However, considering how impatient Sayonji was, that was a 
stretch to impress.

Luckily, it was only a few more seconds before one Shinohara Wakaba 
came stumbling in, out of breath and red faced. She had obviously been 
running to make it.

&quot;Sorry Sayonji-sempai.&quot; She managed to wheeze out.

&quot;Must you actually run from the other side of the campus just to get 
here?&quot; Sayonji calmly retorted. &quot;I would have waited a little longer.&quot; 
Sayonji was also not known for being kind.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want you to wait for very long. I know how much of a stretch 
it is for you to wait as long as you already do.&quot; Wakaba bowed at the 
door and moved to get her practice sword from the wall. &quot;I don&#39;t want 
to seem ungrateful for your taking the time out to actually teach me 
kendo.&quot;

&quot;It is no trouble, you helped me out when I needed it. Oh yes, and 
before you get your sword, please come here.&quot;

Wakaba complied slowly; she was not sure what he was up to. He was 
known for doing odd things at odd times. He was also known for being a 
little mad at times. 

Did she detect a faint blush on his cheeks? 

She was very confused when he presented a piece of tissue paper to her. 
Curiosity got the better of her though and she reached for it.

&quot;Is this for me?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

Her fingers parted the paper and her breath stopped. Inside was a pair 
of wooden hairclips, shaped like leaves. They were painted a green very 
similar to Sayonji&#39;s hair.

&quot;Um, I really wanted to replace the one I gave away. I mean it was kind 
of cruel to give it to the bride, but I just needed-&quot; Sayonji was 
blathering.

&quot;They&#39;re beautiful.&quot; Wakaba interrupted him. Her smile was beautiful. 
&quot;Thank you Sayonji-sempai.&quot; She kissed him on the cheek and backed 
away. His blush deepened and he cleared his throat.

&quot;Alright, enough of that. Get ready; we&#39;ve got a lot of ground to cover 
today.&quot;

Wakaba complied readily. Sayonji stood and readied for a swing. His 
smile was from ear to ear.

She liked them!

Kiryuu Touga sat on one end of the table listening intently to 
everything his client had to say. Listening was essential to his 
success, not only in closing this deal, but also in later success. 
Right now he was staring down a stunning blond in her mid twenties. She 
was a V.P. for an electronics firm that wanted a contract with his 
father&#39;s corporation. His father sent him, in the hopes that he would 
manage to snare her.

&quot;And you see, our company can increase your companies efficiency 
without sacrificing more money and less resources. I believe a joint 
venture between Kiryuu Corporation and Tatewaki electronics would be... 
profitable for the both of us.&quot; She added the last part with a slight 
lilt in her voice and a suggestive eyebrow raise. She was his.

&quot;Indeed, you have impressed me Ai-san. I have the papers in my car. 
Let&#39;s get out of here so we can sign them and then the rest of the 
evening is ours.&quot;

&quot;Indeed Kiryuu-san.&quot;

&quot;Please, call me Touga.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

While Touga was preparing to partake of a meal of a different sort, 
Nanami was not enjoying such luck in her love life. She sat in a yellow 
sweatshirt and black slacks behind her computer and typed furiously.

&quot;What, you can&#39;t break up with me! The beautiful Nanami will not be 
dumped by some pathetic cyber geek! Don&#39;t get offline; I&#39;m not done 
with you! Don&#39;t, don&#39;t...YAROU!&quot;

At last, she slumped over in defeat. Her head impacted the screen and 
her expression held a bleakness that would have paralyzed even the most 
cheery of people.

&quot;I really am pathetic. This is the lowest I&#39;ve ever been.&quot;

&quot;Now, now, don&#39;t worry Nanami-sama. You&#39;re not pathetic. At least I 
don&#39;t think so.&quot; Tsuwabuki Mitsuru said from his spot at the other end 
of her room. He was organizing her schedule for the upcoming week.

&quot;Sorry to tell you this Tsuwabuki, but you&#39;re the only one. Oh how the 
mighty have fallen.&quot;

&quot;Tsuwabuki was at her side instantly, patting her on the back 
consolingly. They heard the sound of doors slamming as &quot;friend&quot; after 
&quot;friend&quot; signed off, leaving Nanami more and more alone. Until they 
heard the sound of someone signing on. Nanami looked up to her list to 
see a name she didn&#39;t recognize appear. It was only one for a few 
seconds. It left a single message and then signed off.

(( Do not worry. All is not lost. The mighty can rise again and claim 
glory. Be warned, peril awaits, but it will give you greater power than 
you had before. Watch your mail. ))

&quot;Nanami-sama, who&#39;s Rose-scented Witch?&quot;

&quot;I have no clue.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Juri opened her locker and spied around quickly to make sure that no 
one else was around to look at the scene inside. While on the outside 
she kept a calm and orderly manner, her locker showed a little of the 
person she really was. The strewn clothes gave the impression of a 
small tropical tornado having centralized in the minute space of her 
locker. The only thing the clutter hadn&#39;t touched was a small shrine in 
the back. Two things lay inside. One small broken locket with the chain 
dangling, and one picture of an attractive threesome. 

Her fingers smoothed over the images of Luka and Shiori. One man who 
had loved her even though she never could love him; and one girl whom 
she used to love. Her mind glossed over the way that felt in her mind. 
Her &#39;used&#39; to love her. She didn&#39;t love Shiori. She didn&#39;t register the 
fact that she was still staring at Shiori&#39;s image with a wistful 
expression. In fact, she didn&#39;t register much, that was until someone 
decided to clear their throat behind her. The fencer jerked upright and 
turned to find someone staring at her kind of strangely. It was a 
rather unassuming looking girl from one of the lower classes. 

Probably one of Tenjou&#39;s peers. 

She quicly covered the locker with the bulk of her body and turned to 
face the girl who was smiling at her with an almost smug look.

&quot;Yes, what can I help you with?&quot; Juri asked with slightly red cheeks. 
The girl giggled lightly and waved her off.

&quot;No, nothing like that sempai. In fact I&#39;m here to help you.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; This was of course the most intelligent answer that Juri could 
give at this point.

&quot;I&#39;m here to help you, you&#39;ve been looking inside of your locker for a 
very long time.&quot; She said as she picked up a stray piece of 
undergarment and examined it front and back; personally wondering how 
the fencer could even stand up straight with it on. &quot;You&#39;re going to be 
late for your next class.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Was Juri&#39;s next intelligent reply.

&quot;Of course since I&#39;m in such a generous mood, I think I&#39;m going to 
offer to take care of your little problem with organizing your locker.&quot;

&quot;Erm, no thank you. I really don&#39;t need the help, besides I really 
don&#39;t think I can afford to pay you for taking the time out; or the 
trouble.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no problem, really. As for a payment...&quot; She looked up at Juri 
through wire rimmed glasses and an eyebrow ring. &quot;I&#39;m sure the 
legindary Arisagawa Juri-sempai could think of some way to pay me back. 
At least that&#39;s what Shiori tells me.&quot;

Juri stiffened and her eyes narrowed. &quot;Shiori told you?&quot; She watched 
the girl carefully fold the piece of lingerie and shoved her way past 
into the locker where she began folding other things and generally 
organizing things. &quot;Yes, she said that were the best friend a girl 
oculd have while she was going through a very difficult time in her 
life. Also said that she gave you a rather difficult time as well.&quot; 
This time she got a patented Juri-eyebrow raise.

Juri was starting to feel strange, almost comfortable with this girl 
messing with her locker. Something she would never have forgiven 
before. She didn&#39;t even realize that she had been changing back into 
her normal uniform the entire time she had been talking. A long time 
ago, certian runmors had prompted her change on her own without the 
accusing stares or worried glances of the other girls. However, she was 
fully aware of this new girl reaching for the little shrine in back. 
Her hand caught the smaller one before her fingers sullied the sacred 
space of her shrine.

&quot;You seem awfully protective of a silly picture and a broken locket. 
Sentimental perhaps?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps.&quot; Juri replied coldly; a little of the panther coming through 
at just the right time. The strange girls eyes widened for a second and 
then the shocked look faded. She smiled and released her hand from the 
grip.

&quot;Alright, I know when to catch a hint. I&#39;m done here anyway. I&#39;ll see 
you around Sempai.&quot;

&quot;W-wait! What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Hi-mits-su-des.&quot; Was the last thing she heard before the door closed 
behind the girl, leaving a very confused Juri behind. 

(Note: Himitsu des is japanese for &quot;a secret&quot; Commonly used by Xellos 
from Slayers when he says &quot;Sore Wa... Himitsu des&quot; or &quot;That is... a 
secret.&quot;)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As Juri exited the fencing room, her brain was still spinning from the 
strange encounter with the odd girl. She mused over the girls behavior, 
and how familiar she was with Juri. It was enough to question how well 
her reputation was holding up these days.

Juri was so absorbed in her private reverie that she almost missed the 
scene that was playing out... almost. Juri&#39;s keen senses caught sight 
of Kaoru Kozue stalking the halls like the wild animal she was. Then 
one of the boys she frequently was seen with caught up to her and 
pressed her against the wall.

&quot;Hey babe, long times no see. I&#39;ve missed you. What&#39;s say we ditch the 
rest of the day and go on a &#39;date&#39;&quot;?

&quot;Sorry, no.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry you obviously didn&#39;t get the memo.&quot; Kozue said, ripping her 
hands away from him. We&#39;re through.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean we&#39;re through?&quot;

&quot;Poor boy, it must be tough living without a brain like that. I mean 
that I&#39;m done with you, all of you. You and your friends. I only went 
out with you to fulfill a goal. Now that it&#39;s done I don&#39;t want to see 
you anymore. But it was fun while it lasted, thanks.&quot;

&quot;Fun... a goal... done. Who do you think you are? You were using us 
like toys. You have no right!&quot;

At this point, a scene was forming as students came out to watch the 
altercation. Juri just watched and waited. If all went well, she would 
not be needed here, but....

&quot;We ain&#39;t toys to be played with! Especially not by some dumb bitch 
slut like you!&quot; He raised his hand to slap her unimpressed face. She 
seemed as if his words meant nothing to her. Then again with Kozue, 
they just might have. Juri cursed her luck and made her move.

For herself, Kozue couldn&#39;t figure out why they all got so emotional 
when she told them they were through. It&#39;s not like she was the only 
girl in school who&#39;d put out for them. It wasn&#39;t her fault that she was 
exceptionally good at it; or that she took better care of her body than 
some. She hated the fact that it always ended the same way. She was 
wondering how much make up it would take to conceal this. She sighed 
and closed her eyes for the blow. It didn&#39;t come. She opened them again 
to see Juri pull him off of her, his arm bent behind his back. She 
slammed him against the wall and leaned in close. She whispered 
something in his ear that she couldn&#39;t hear if she even bothered to 
listen in. He was released and pealed out across the hall, as far away 
as he could get. She extricated herself from the wall and addressed the 
panther.

&quot;I suppose I should be grateful.&quot;

&quot;I suppose you should try to be more careful when breaking up. I may 
not be here next time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not worried, the pain only lasts for a few minutes and then I&#39;m 
one step closer to being done.&quot;

&quot;Done what?&quot;

&quot;Freeing myself for him.&quot; Kozue&#39;s voice sounded soft and pained as she 
said it.

&quot;For who.&quot; Juri was curious. Kozue was known for going through boys 
quickly. A fact that was no small source of pain for Miki. Speaking of 
Miki, he chose that moment to burst through the crowd and run up to 
Kozue.

&quot;Kozue, are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine Onii-sama.&quot; There was softness in Kozue voice and face. 
Juri&#39;s eyebrow piqued at this. Miki&#39;s expression was more concerned 
than normal and Kozue was being nice. &quot;Aoba tried to reinforce why I 
should be in a relationship with him with his fists.&quot;

Odd

&quot;What; He tried what?&quot; Miki was yelling. His face shot towards the 
crowd, looking for the perpetrator. Was it just Juri&#39;s imagination or 
did she just see a wild wolf flash over his features for a second. His 
rage quelled just as quickly when Kozue laid a hand on his arm.

Odder

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Miki-onii-sama, Juri sempai intimidated him enough for the 
both of you. She even roughed him up a bit for you.&quot; Her eyes danced 
with amusement as she regarded Juri. Miki turned to Juri, just noticing 
her.

&quot;Juri-sempai was here? Thank goodness. Thank you Juri-sempai. You have 
no idea what this means to me.&quot;

&quot;No problem, but you should take care of your sister.&quot; Juri answered 
soberly. She knew of Kozue&#39;s ability for getting into trouble

&quot;I fully intend to.&quot; He answered with all sincerity. His face a mask of 
determination. Kozue blushed behind him...

...Kozue blushed?

Oddest

They shared a look and Juri nodded. The crowd began to disperse and 
Juri disappeared into it. She didn&#39;t notice the looks and touched the 
twins shared as they checked Kozue over; and if she did, she did a very 
good job of not showing it.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Akio sat behind his desk looking over some papers. On top of the 
responsibilities he had before, he now had to handle business 
transactions that had to deal with the school. The construction was 
starting to run over budget and the football club needed new uniforms. 
He was beginning to feel overwhelmed. He ran his hands through his hair 
and sighed. Kanae came up behind him and started massaging his 
shoulders.

&quot;Poor Akio-sama, You have no more time to yourself. Maybe you need 
help.&quot;

&quot;I do need help, but I also need someone I can trust. People like that 
are rare these days.&quot;

&quot;Maybe I could be of assistance then,&quot; a new voice chimed in from the 
door. The outline of a rather voluptuous woman stood in the doorway. 
Akio&#39;s interest piqued.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d fallen off the face of the earth.&quot;

&quot;I did, right into the ends of the earth.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be sarcastic, it doesn&#39;t suit you.&quot;

Kanae was confused; the way they spoke was very familiar. She thought 
she knew all of Akio&#39;s contacts and lovers. She licked her lips and 
grinned evilly. She knew Akio&#39;s lovers very well. She wanted to thank 
him then for opening her eyes to the joy of seduction. But first to 
address the matter at hand. The other things could wait.

&quot;Akio-sama, who is this woman? I&#39;ve never met her before.&quot;

&quot;Of course you didn&#39;t Kanae dear. This is my sister&quot;

&quot;Quite, dear brother.&quot; The newcomer intruded. She took a few steps in, 
but her features were still unreadable

&quot;I thought Anthy was your only sibling Akio-sama.&quot;

&quot;Apparently we were wrong.&quot;

&quot;Can you at least tell me her name?&quot;

&quot;I would if I knew it. If you would.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry brother. The names Ohtori Kami&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Miki leaned against a wall in his room and let out the breath he had 
been holding since before he heard of the altercation. His shoulders 
slumped and he had to lean against the wall. Kozue came up behind him 
and wrapped her arms around him.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to worry you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault.&quot;

&quot;Yes it is! If I hadn&#39;t of been like that I wouldn&#39;t have had to put 
you through this.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one they hit.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re the one who&#39;s tarnished every time you jump in there to 
help me!&quot;

&quot;Like I said before, it&#39;s not your fault; I would have worried about 
you anyway. And don&#39;t worry about tarnishing me. Every time I do, you 
become a little cleaner. Maybe im the end we&#39;ll finally be a matching 
pair.&quot;

Kozue laughed as she cried into the back of his uniform jacket. She 
felt him shift until he was facing her. He buried his face in her hair 
and sighed.

&quot;You do realize I&#39;m a wild animal. I will probably bite you.&quot;

&quot;Even a tame animal knows how to protect itself. Besides, I might just 
like it.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Peace was always a welcome change to the duelists. The chance to return 
to their lives was just what they needed. Of course, they knew it 
couldn&#39;t last, and that thought haunted them every day. Then the 
letters came...

Wakaba was walking home. Sayonji&#39;s hairclip held in her hair. She 
hummed happily to herself. To get to her dorm she had to pass the rose 
garden. Then it caught her eye. Just sticking out from the brush was a 
single brown rose. She almost ignored it as well, thinking it was just 
another dead rose; but something compelled her to look closer. Then she 
realized that the rose wasn&#39;t dead, but a beautiful brown bloom. It was 
the same color as her hair. She felt a powerful urge to pick the 
flower. As if doing it would fulfill some part of her destiny. She did 
so and stood up to take a closer look in the light. That&#39;s when she saw 
the dewdrop fall. It fell right into her outstretched hand.

When did I go to catch it?

When she looked down, there was not water in her hand, but a beautiful 
rose signet ring. Upon closer inspection though, she noticed a 
variation. Instead of the usual red stone, there was a delicate brown 
stone coloring it.

&quot;What... is... this?&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Akio sat back in his office and luxuriated. With his sister around, he 
had time for so many new things. He couldn&#39;t even remember the last 
time he had gotten a haircut. As he relaxed and let the strands fall, 
he looked across the room to where Kami leaned against the telescope. 
She was examining it.

&quot;It&#39;s an incredible piece of technology isn&#39;t it?&quot; He purred from his 
seat.

&quot;Quite.&quot; She responded enthusiastically. &quot;And you say it can make 
anything as real as the real thing.&quot;

&quot;In this world, more.&quot;

Silence followed for a few minutes as Kami energetically zipped around 
the telescope prodding and poking around to examine it.

&quot;I hear that you recently invited Shinohara Wakaba-san into the duels.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m overstepping my bounds brother, but I felt that 
she would be a welcome attachment to the game.&quot;

&quot;I approve, don&#39;t worry. However, I was wondering. Since my sister 
left, we do have an opening for a prize to be won. Have you found a 
suitable replacement?&quot;

&quot;There is no need for a bride anymore brother. As you saw from the end 
of the last duels, the role of the rose bride is negated. Any person 
who knows of the game can duplicate her role. I figured on a more 
suitable prize for the victor.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see, now just relax brother. Or else you might make that 
darling wife of yours slip.&quot; Kami said, leering at Kanae. As Akio 
leaned back and reveled in the sensations, Kami merely took to the 
elevator.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Anthy and Utena were curled up on the couch watching television. It was 
Saturday morning and Anthy had a growing anime addiction to feed. They 
giggle at a particularly amusing antic and relaxed. Well, Anthy relaxed 
while Utena angst&#39;s behind her. She buried her face in the dark 
princesses hair. Anthy sighed, but contented and concerned

&quot;What is it Utena-otto?&quot;

&quot;Hime, I don&#39;t think I can do this. I can&#39;t take his chasing me.&quot;

&quot;We could just not enroll in the school.&quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s not an option. We&#39;ve been forcibly enrolled, we even have 
schedules set up for us.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Anthy, I&#39;m afraid. It was almost too much last time, and that 
was before I really had this much to lose. Before, we weren&#39;t together 
like this. I mean, we were engaged, but I was still looking for my 
prince and couldn&#39;t even fathom being with another girl. Now I don&#39;t 
want to go and risk losing you.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t, I&#39;m not a prize to be won anymore. I have been properly wed 
and now belong to my husband.&quot; Anthy said as she snuggled back further.

&quot;I can&#39;t do this alone.&quot;

&quot;You wont have to.&quot;

&quot;W-what.&quot;

&quot;I have contacted some friends. Don&#39;t worry, you wont have to do this 
alone.&quot;

Utena sighed and inhaled the rosy scent of Anthy. She had at least 
these moments for peace, and she would cherish them.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On five lockers, in Ohtori academy, a letter was taped. Each letter was 
cased in a golden envelope waiting. The envelope was not meant for the 
eyes of any but the chosen few. On each one was written a single name.

Shirobara no Hanayami.

And the letters waited. While two lovers enjoyed the simple joy of 
Saturday mornings.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Preview of Next Episode: 

Utena: W-w-w-w-w-what the! My aunt is back from vacation. But how does 
she know Anthy. What do you mean my father was a duelist? He left What 
behind? And why does Auntie Yurika keep giggling like that.

Anthy: Maybe we should just wait and see.

Utena: Oy, my head hurts now.

Anthy: Next time on Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Rose of Revolution. Running 
interference, my aunt Yurika. Be sure to watch. It&#39;s the Absolute 
Destiny Apocalypse.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Disclaimer: I do not own Utena, the duelists, the school or the 
premise. I do own the new duelists, but I don&#39;t have them copyrighted 
so take them as you please. Just tell me where you put them so I can 
read it ^__^.

Note: Chu-chu will be returning to Anthy next episode. Also, yes Wakaba 
is a duelist, but she wont be as disillusioned as the others. Her new 
breed of ring does mean something, but I&#39;m not telling just yet. There 
are going to be three types of rings. The classic rose signet will 
still be around, but their numbers will start to dwindle. The duelists&#39; 
personal rings, which always come in their color. And a new gold ring; 
that one I&#39;ll leave you guessing with.</pre>
