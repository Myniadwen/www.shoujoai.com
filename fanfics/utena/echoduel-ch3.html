<h1>Echoes of a Final Duel (part 3 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/echoduel-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Arisugawa Juri strode through the crowd, the young
people moving aside for the tall, fierce looking older
woman when her dangerous glance fell on them. &#39;Looks
like I&#39;ve still got it,&#39; she mused, her orange mane
falling in curling waves down her back.

The fall Christmas bazzar was the last place she would
have expected to be, in all honestly. Stands run by
college and university students were set up around the
busy park, a mix of young people and adults shopping
for early gifts or playing some of the games.

&#39;And here I am to get my fortune told,&#39; Juri thought
to herself wryly.

More accurately she was here under Anthy&#39;s
instructions, shortly after Juri had been complaining
about finding the right people for the club she wanted
to open. She had Anthy over at her Shinjuku apartment
to talk when converstion had turned to Juri&#39;s plans,
then the dusky skined girl had taken Juri&#39;s tea cup
from her.

Gazing into the remnants of Juri&#39;s tea Anthy had been
silent. &quot;You need to go to the fair this weekend,&quot;
Anthy finally said, &quot;there&#39;s a young lady telling
fortunes there you need to meet.&quot;

Juri tried to get Anthy to explain more, of course,
but she was firm. Juri had to go there, and she wasn&#39;t
going to tell her anything else. So reluctantly Juri
had gotten ready that morning and headed out,
wondering if this weasn&#39;t the enigmatic Anthy&#39;s idea
of a joke.

&quot;Hey, you,&quot; Juri calmly collared a young man, the boy
looking up at her in surprise and just a bit of alarm.

&quot;Ah, yes?&quot; he squeaked out.

&quot;Is there a fortune teller here?&quot; Juri coldly
demanded, still keeping a firm grip on the mildly
frightened young man.

&quot;I think so,&quot; he looked at her warily before
explaining where it was situated, scampering away as
soon as she let him go.

&#39;That was almost fun,&#39; Juri mused as she made her way
through the crowds. The tent was set off to the side,
a simple hand made sign hanging by the door, She
pushed the flap aside and went inside, blinking a few
times to adjust to the dim light.

The young lady sitting at the table didn&#39;t look much
like how Juri would have envisioned a fortune teller.
She was young, late teens or early twenties, and her
short brown hair looked oddly cute on her. She wore
casual clothes, the only strange thing about her being
the odd, teardrop shaped ruby pendant that hung around
her neck.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she looked casually up only to freeze upon
seeing Juri standing there. Eyes wide she blurted out,
&quot;It&#39;s you!&quot;

Juri raised a single eyebrow and asked, &quot;Is there a
problem, Miss...?&quot;

&quot;Hitomi,&quot; she blushed, looking down in embarassment.
She took a set of tarot cards, shuffling them
uncomfortable in her hands, &quot;Did you want your fortune
told, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa Juri,&quot; she answered, pulling out a chair
and sitting down oposite her.

At the sound of her name Hitomi lost her grip on the
cards, the hand painted cards flying around the small
room. &quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Hitomi blinked, the oddest
look on her face.

Juri looked over at Hitomi in surprise as the two of
them bent to pick up the scattered cards. &quot;How did you
know about that name?&quot; Juri asked.

&quot;I&#39;m psychic,&quot; Hitomi said a bit sheepishly as she
picked up a card, flipping it over casually only to
freeze. &quot;The Tower,&quot; she murmured, looking at the
image of a castle tower that was being struck by
lightning thoughtfully.

&quot;Is that good or bad?&#39; Juri asked curiously as they
finished getting the cards together. She straightened,
brushing off her long pants with a slight smile on her
face.

Hitomi looked up, gazing at Juri seriously as she put
the card back in the deck, &quot;It&#39;s change, sometimes
cataclysmic changes.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been doing a lot of that lately,&quot; Juri conceded,
thinking of her recent inheritence, the meeting with
Utena and now her plans to open a night club.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure the Tower was meant for you,&quot; Hitomi
admitted, &quot;I think it&#39;s mine.&quot;

Juri stood, looking at Hitomi thoughtfully for a few
moments then asked, &quot;Would you mind if we go talk
about this somewhere more comfortable?&quot;

Not long after they were sitting in a corner of one of
the food tents, bento boxes and drinks sitting in
front of them as they talked. &quot;I&#39;ve been havving
visions about it for the past week or so,&quot; Hitomi
said, &quot;working in a nightclub that only had women in
it.&quot;

&#39;A week ago, that&#39;s about when Anthy suggested I go
out here,&#39; Juri mused, &#39;a coincidence?&#39;

Hitomi looked up at Juri shyly, &quot;You&#39;re taking the
idea I have visions very calmly.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve seen some very strange stuff,&quot; Juri answered
calmly, &quot;it takes a bit more than that to throw me off
balance.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Hitomi flashed a smile. She looked thoughtful,
&quot;I&#39;ve seen various other women working there, they&#39;re
oddly distinctive people....&quot;

&quot;Can you tell me about them?&quot; Juri leaned forward
eagerly, realizing that her problems in finding just
the right employees might be solved.

Later that afternoon Juri was heading back to her
apartment, a notebook filled with Hitomi&#39;s
observations carefully tucked away in her pocket. She
didn&#39;t entirely trust the visions of the young woman,
it was a bit too much like a miracle to her, but at
the very least it might be a good lead.

&quot;And it helps,&quot; Juri mused aloud, &quot;that at least one
of them is a person that I&#39;d like to see once again.&quot;

It was a long drive out from Tokyo, and she had to
wait until the weekend before she could get away.
Clearing up all the legal issues of her inheritance
was painfully slow, not to mention the agrivation Juri
was dealing with from her family.

The shrine wasn&#39;t easily accessable, but Juri knew the
residents prefered that. She pulled up in her llittle
sportscar, climbing up casually and walking towards
the front gate and the two beautifully painted posts
standing on either side.

&#147;Azaka, Kamidake,&#148; Juri smiled as she headed fot the
gate, &quot;it&#39;s been a while.&quot;

&quot;Good to see you,&quot; Azaka responded, the gem on the
collum glowing as it spoke.

Kamidake sounded mildly apologetic as it added, &quot;I&#39;m
not sure where the others are right now, though I know
Miss Washu is in the house.&quot;

Juri chuckled softly, &quot;Considering her tendency to
experiment on innocent bystanders I think I&#39;ll avoid
Washu for now.&quot;

With a casual wave Juri walked by the sprawling house
then back into the forest, soon finding the familiar
stone steps. Cherry blossoms blew as she walked up,
her long coat swirling around her legs. The scent in
the air was familiar and she breathed deep,
remembering the days that she had spent here in this
beautiful place.

&quot;You know,&quot; a familiar voice said as Juri finally
neared the top of the stairs, &quot;I still can&#39;t get over
the resemblance.&quot;

Juri reached the level of the shrine and blinked as
she took in the scene. Princess Ayeka stood to one
side, her dark purple hair tied back casually, the
Jurai robes that she wore giving her an air of
dignity. To the side Ryouko stood, her long light blue
hair it&#39;s usual unruly state, while to the side
stood... another Ryouko?!

As the other turned Juri realized that it wasn&#39;t
Ryouko, but the resemblance was uncanny. The biggest
difference was the twin scars, one on each cheek, that
and the look in the woman&#39;s eyes. There was an
openness there, kindness, as if she was willing to see
the best in the people she met.

&quot;Arisugawa,&quot; Ryouko moved fast, slapping her on the
shoulder and nearly sending Juri to the ground, &quot;it&#39;s
been too long, damn it!&quot;

&quot;Juri-san,&quot; Ayaka was more formal but her smile was
just as warm, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri flashed a quick smile before looking
over to the other woman curiously.

&quot;Minagi,&quot; she introduced herself with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m
Ryouko&#39;s little sister, sort of.&quot;

So what brings you out here?&quot; Ryouko asked as she
casually put her hand over Juri&#39;s shoulders. &quot;I&#39;ve got
this sake,&quot; she grinned, &quot;back at the house if you&#39;d
care to join us?&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Juri shook her head, &quot;I still remember the
last hangover I got trying to keep up with your
drinking,&quot; She paused, trying to think about how to
put it best then bluntly said, &quot;In fact, I came out
here to offer you a job.&quot;

All three ladies looked at Juri in surprise a moment
before asking, &quot;What?&quot;

To be continued....

Author&#39;s Note: Hitomi is more or less a fusion of both
Escaflowne the series and the movie versions, while
Ryouko, Ayeka and Minagi are OVA/Manga incarnations. I
wanted to look into how Juri got such an odd staff for
the Locket together, with Anthy and Hitomi playing a role.</pre>
