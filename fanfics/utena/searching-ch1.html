<h1>Searching</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	She once said to me that our love would last forever. Now 
when I look back on it I find it hard to believe I trusted her so much. 
No, that I continue to trust her so much.
	I&#39;m not the trusting kind but somehow she broke through every 
last wall I&#39;d placed around my heart. She broke through them all with 
an intoxicating ease.
	To me, she was like a drug. She infected my system until I 
couldn&#39;t think of anything but her. It was confounding and joyous at the 
same time. I wanted it but at the same time I didn&#39;t.
	I can still remember the look in her eyes right before she 
disappeared from my life.
	That look of utter escape and freedom.
	It was my fault... I know that. It was I who helped arrange this 
trap for her. This test for her. She rose to the challenge and escaped.
	From me and from my plans. From all our plans. I was glad 
for her... I wanted her to escape.
	But I didn&#39;t want to lose her. I couldn&#39;t stand to lose her. 
Somehow she had become life itself to me. So I turned my back on 
my brother. The only person that I&#39;d given my heart to in all these 
lonely years.
	I took my heart from him and gave it to her as I left our  
constructed dream world to find her.
	My search goes on as the years pass with a blink of eye. I 
search for her still. As long as I sense her presence in this world I&#39;ll 
continue to search for her.
	For my true Prince.
	Wait for me, Utena. I swear to you that I&#39;m coming. Your 
Bride has never been one to give up so easily.

The character of Himemiya Anthy is this fanfiction is from 
Revolutionary Girl Utena. Yeah, I finally decided to write a plain old 
Utena/Anthy love story fanfic. It&#39;s a tad short and on the melancholy 
side but I was in a melancholy mood when I wrote it. Being hormonal 
is a pain in the ass.
