<h1>No Rock to Cling to (part 6 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lppyro.html">LadyPrince Pyro</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/norock-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The Movement of Pawns

To say she was upset and outraged was an understatement. She was livid, 
but she had far too much pride and cool control to show how badly she 
wanted to throttle him. Not because of his request or the fact that it 
was short notice. Not because he had gone behind her back and arranged 
such a thing, oh no...those she might have forgiven for the sake of a 
favor. It was that damn arrogant self-assured smirk he still had 
plastered across his lips. Juri Arisugawa slammed a manicured fist on 
the polished cherry wood desk, her glowing orange curls bouncing 
violently.

&quot;How dare you Touga! How dare you go behind my back and include my 
company in your plan! My business is not subject to your arrogant 
whims!&quot; The woman gave a panther&#39;s snarl of anger and annoyance.

Saionji hid a smile of glee behind his hand as he watched Arisugawa 
unbraid Touga in front of them. He remembered her well from the time 
they had served on the council together back at Ohtori. But seeing her 
there, still gorgeous and still with the biggest balls he had ever seen 
on a woman...filled him with a quiet reassurance. Arisugawa hadn&#39;t 
changed....she had grown and expanded in several aspects, but she was 
still Juri...

Juri who had openly debunked him at council meetings and didn&#39;t give a 
damn about the duels...Juri who had been captain of the fencing team but 
had never let her prestige stop her from lending a hand to a student now 
and then...Juri who was known as the Beautiful Panther on campus, and 
always stuck to her responsibilities...

...Juri who had once lent a sword to Tenjou the day she re-dueled Touga 
for the Rose Bride, and won...

Which of course was why they were trying to enlist her help. Saionji 
himself had never really spoken to the pink haired underclassmen except 
to hurl insults or threats. And Juri herself hadn&#39;t interacted all that 
much with her either...and least not until the end. But she was a part 
of it all, and if what Anthy had told them was true, they were going to 
need all the help they could get.

Juri for her part wasn&#39;t really angry so much that Touga had wanted her 
help...she might have even considered going along with his plan to 
getting Tenjou over here to see if they could jog her memory. She didn&#39;t 
exactly agree that she might be memorable enough to the girl to refresh 
her memory of her past. But she was willing to try...she certainly owed 
Tenjou that much.

No, what drove her up the wall was the arrogance Touga had shown in 
thinking he could just snap his fingers and everyone would be more than 
happy to blindly go along with his plans. Who needed to be polite? Who 
needed to consult with the damn owner of the company? He was Touga 
Kiryuu, master playboy and egomaniac! She ground her teeth as he tried 
to placate her with empty flattery and false statements and intentions.

All the while Himemiya was sitting there looking prim and graceful in 
her office chair. But Juri was still somewhat floored to see her, even 
now. She was beautiful, yes...still as youthful and exotic as ever. But 
that wasn&#39;t what made Juri want to cock her head in question. It was her 
eyes...

For as long as she could remember...or at least now that her memory had 
been returned to her, Anthy had always had the deadest eyes she had ever 
seen. Like a doll&#39;s eyes, with a doll&#39;s perfect beatific expression. But 
now that was all changed. Her eyes had life in them...filled with a 
drive and a passion that reminded her sharply of Utena. But she wasn&#39;t 
the same as that kind hearted busy-body...who felt it her business to 
coach an older student on a relationship she was naive of. No...unlike 
the Prince, the Witch had a cunning and a hardness to her eyes that said 
she had seen it all, and it didn&#39;t impress her.

But if what they were telling her was true, maybe that was no longer the 
case. According to Kiryuu and Kyouichi&#39;s narrations, that rose-tinted 
girl she remembered smiling and laughing as she stretched in front of 
the window...she was gone.

And they were looking to get her back.

Juri sighed and sat back in her chair. Himemiya had restored her 
memories...memories she hadn&#39;t even known she had forgotten, with no 
effort at all it seemed. Just a hand on her temple and suddenly she 
remembered. No pain, no sleepiness, no ill effects. Ha, too bad the boys 
hadn&#39;t gotten such a good deal. But now that she remembered, she 
couldn&#39;t just forget how much she owed that girl...and how badly she 
wanted to see her, if only one more time.

&quot;Alright..&quot; she said, holding up a hand to halt the red maned pretty 
boy. Touga leaned back in his chair, waiting patiently and gracefully. 
&quot;If I understand what you want to do...you want me to hold a photo shoot 
for this punk rock band...in my elegant women&#39;s magazine...a bunch of 
teeny boppers...and do what, talk to Tenjou? See if I can get her to 
remember?

Anthy stepped in and shook her head, &quot;No...I think that tactic has 
already been tried too many times with...ill effects.&quot; Touga sat up 
straighter slightly, his brow furrowed as he gave a nod of agreement.

&quot;I think it would be best if you can just observe her...see if you can 
get her to let slip some sort of clue on how to reverse this condition. 
We three will be watching from elsewhere...I don&#39;t think it would be a 
good idea if she were to see us so soon...after our last, ah, 
encounter.&quot;

Juri leaned slightly forward, &quot;Just observe? And you think she&#39;ll drop a 
clue do you? Sounds like a rather vague plan. Losing our touch, are we?&quot; 
Her lip curled slightly in a smirk. Touga returned the smirk and 
casually replied, &quot;Well I didn&#39;t think it my place to tell the owner of 
C.E. publications how to go about her business.&quot;

Juri gave an amused chuckled and settled once more in her chair, 
reaching for the phone as she did so. The tension that had been in the 
room earlier had melted into companionship. Even Anthy was smiling and 
looking a bit relieved. &quot;So you will help us then?&quot;

Juri knew she wasn&#39;t just asking about this little photo shoot. All or 
nothing as they say.

&quot;Yes...you have my word...I will do all in my power to help you. For 
now, let me make a few phone calls...you didn&#39;t exactly leave me with 
much time...and I suppose I&#39;m right in guessing you want me to get this 
arranged as soon as possible if she&#39;s...getting worse?&quot;

Anthy&#39;s head bowed, her curtain of rich violet hair sweeping in around 
face. &quot;...Please...&quot;

Juri gave a nod and then began speaking to several people on the phone, 
her voice clipped and professional, but never losing it&#39;s politeness. 
While she was busy, Touga turned his body in his chair to face both of 
his companions and spoke in a low voice. Wouldn&#39;t do to upset Arisugawa 
again.

&quot;I know of another person who may have more of an affect on Tenjou, 
Saionji...someone who was the closest to her out of all of us...besides 
you of course, Himemiya.&quot;

Anthy waved the assurance away, &quot;You mean that girl who would always 
hang around her....Wakaba?&quot;

Saionji paled and whipped his head around forcefully. His voice came out 
as little more than a squeezed harsh whisper, &quot;No....no...No Touga! I 
don&#39;t want her to get involved! Do you understand me?&quot;

Anthy turned to look at Saionji quizzically, but Touga was more than 
pleased to answer her unspoken question, &quot;Oh...Saionji is soon to ask 
the lovely Shinohara-san to marry him! Isn&#39;t that simply lovely?&quot;

The exotic woman looked surprised and pleased, &quot;Oh my! Congratulations, 
Saionji...I wasn&#39;t aware you two were together.&quot;

The green haired man gave a scowl, a blush on his cheeks. This made 
Touga grin all the wider, but Saionji&#39;s dark look wiped it clean. &quot;I 
don&#39;t want her involved in this...I don&#39;t want to get her caught up in 
all of what is happening here...she remembers mostly good things about 
school and our lives here now. What if she hates me? What if she leaves 
and never comes back? I couldn&#39;t deal with that. And I couldn&#39;t deal 
with her getting hurt, if Utena is leaking power everywhere like 
Himemiya-san is thinking.&quot;


He turned away, his face cold and harsh. Even after all these years, 
Touga observed, his friend still had a hard time now and then keeping 
his heart off his sleeve. He placed a consoling hand on his old friend&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;I understand...&quot; he glanced at the orange curled Juri, who 
was still busy on the phone. &quot;...I do. But think about it this way: 
Utena and Wakaba were friends long before we met either of them...what 
must it be like to suddenly forget your closest friend and protector 
ever existed? It must bother her on some level to not be able to recall 
her face...and it would be worse for her than for us.&quot; Touga didn&#39;t 
understand at that point in time just how right he was.

Saionji gave a heavy sigh, but a nod of acceptance. Himemiya who had 
been quiet all this time leaned forward a bit and brushed back a strand 
of hair past her smooth cheek. &quot;If you...do decide to talk to her about 
what is going on...you have my word that I will not allow harm to come 
to her if I can stop it. And if she would want to forget 
again...well...I can do that too.&quot;

Saionji gave a small sad smile, and nodded his thanks. He would think on 
it. The red haired man who sat beside him however noted how carefully 
Anthy had worded that particular promise. My my...still quite the 
cunning little enchantress...they never really had understood how well 
she had pulled the strings that puppeted them. Now he got another 
glimpse of that powerful mind behind those lovely green eyes.

Juri finished her calls and stood from her desk. &quot;All right, everything 
is in place. Two days from now we&#39;ll have the group come in for an 
interview in Cultivated Elegance&#39;s story on Modern Youth and the 
Influences of Music. I have personally undertaken the job of 
photographer for the photos that will be used in the article my staff is 
quickly writing up. That will give me ample time to see just how bad 
this situation has gotten. I&#39;ll go from there. Is there anything else 
then?&quot;

Anthy stood along with her two &#39;bodyguards&#39; and gave a bow and smile 
full of gratitude. &quot;No, that&#39;s all. Thank you Arisugawa-san...I really 
appreciate what you&#39;re doing for us.&quot;

Juri gave a wave of dismissal and a smile of her own. &quot;It&#39;s my pleasure. 
Well if we&#39;re all done here, I&#39;ve got to be getting home. I promised I&#39;d 
be back early for dinner.&quot;

It was then that Touga caught the glint of gold on her ring finger. He 
wondered why he hadn&#39;t noticed it before. Himemiya was thinking much the 
same thing but wrote it off as being used to seeing a ring of a 
different sort on that slender, noble, finger. Saionji unbeknownst to 
his companions had picked up on it from the moment he had come into the 
room. Ah, but then one tended to be more observant of those who were 
once your rivals.

The trio left the office, and Arisugawa left soon after them, her step 
not quite as light as it usually was, and no tune hummed under her 
breath. But then...fresh memories of broken idols and swords torn from 
one&#39;s chest tended to dampen the mood just a bit...

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

All the while, trouble was brewing elsewhere.

&quot;Dude! What&#39;s the deal with these new songs lately? I mean...yeah, 
they&#39;re good and all-&quot;

&quot;Do you have a problem playing them?&quot;

&quot;No...but I mean, they&#39;re not our style...ya know? I mean when we first 
started this band, we played a couple oddballs but we mainly stuck to 
our guns and played punk and rock sets...that&#39;s what got us here in the 
first place after all.&quot;

&quot;Sure, if you say so.&quot;

&quot;The hell is that supposed to mean?!&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me, Eric?&quot; Utena&#39;s voice became a dangerous purr. 
The rest of the bandmates stood around the room uncomfortably, except 
Jared who was standing just a little behind Ten somewhat like a 
bodyguard. His face was one of blank adoration, like a man who had seen 
divinity and still carried a piece of it with him. But hearing his two 
closest companions at each other&#39;s throats seemed to bring him back to 
the present. Placing a calming hand on both women&#39;s shoulders, he tried 
to soothe the tension.

&quot;Now now...I think the direction we&#39;re moving isn&#39;t a bad one, in 
fact--&quot;

Eric heatedly jerked his hand off and rounded on him, Mason moving up 
behind her, and Lance going over to comfort Violet who looked worried 
and withdrawn.

&quot;What are you, her little bitch?! Ever since you went to go check on 
her, you two have been all buddy-buddy... did she fu--&quot;

&quot;Hey come on now, Eric...that&#39;s enough.&quot; Mason pleaded. But Utena merely 
smirked and crossed her arms, &quot;Why ask that...are you jealous Eric?&quot; 
Mason had to hold his girlfriend back to keep her from taking a step 
forward. She looked mad enough to start spitting. &quot;YOU!!WHAT MAKES YOU 
THINK YOU CAN JUST WALK IN HERE AND RUN THINGS, HUH?!&quot;

Utena walked away in the middle of her tirade, the heated words rolling 
off her back indifferently. She moved over to Violet, as if the others 
weren&#39;t there. &quot;Hey Violet, didn&#39;t you get an offer today to play with 
that famous pianist?&quot;

Nervous and unsure at the sudden change in topic, Violet answered in 
that quiet stammer of hers. &quot;A-ah..yes....y-yes they said that Mr. Miki 
Kaoru wanted to play a duet together...for a radio presentation in a 
couple days.&quot;

Utena gave her a warm smile, and Violet relaxed at the kindness and good 
humor in those robin&#39;s egg eyes. &quot;Oh yeah? He&#39;s pretty famous I 
hear...when are you scheduled to do that? I &#39;d love to hear you two play 
together.&quot;

Violet found herself blushing slightly under that gaze, narrowed on her. 
Smiling a little, she related what the managers had told her. Utena gave 
a nod as she thought it over, and asked, &quot;Will you be able to make it to 
the photo shoot and interview? You know that C.E. thing is scheduled 
that same day...I would hate for you to miss it.&quot; Violet shook her head, 
brushing a strand of short straight hair out of her eyes. She was 
smiling fully now, &quot;Oh no...it&#39;s alright. Mr. Kaoru said he would have 
his car drive me and Mr. Yoshuhaku over to the C.E. building after we 
were done. We&#39;ll be there on time.&quot;

The pink haired older woman smiled and patted her shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; 
In the background, Eric scoffed and angrily stomped out, &quot;Hitting on 
defenseless little girls now, are we? Stupid slut...&quot;

Eric suddenly found herself looking up at the ceiling, dazed. The room 
was full of a stunned silence, and when she found the ringing in her 
ears had stopped, Eric looked up to see Jared standing over her, with a 
black scowl on his face. &quot;Going a bit too far there...I won&#39;t have you 
talking about Ten that way...&quot;

Mason moved over, fist raised and a look of anger plastered on his own 
face, but Lance was magically there, keeping the two apart. &quot;HEY! Okay 
guys, cool it! Jared, that was sooo not cool, bro...you don&#39;t hit a girl 
man, and you DON&#39;T hit your friends. I don&#39;t care WHAT the reason. And 
Mason, you&#39;re not helping here. Now I think everyone here needs to cool 
off and take a walk.&quot;

&quot;Excellent idea...bastards...I am so out of here...&quot; Eric was tearfully 
helped up by Mason and the two stormed out, but as she was leaving she 
turned back to glare at her once friend and now enemy. &quot;Don&#39;t think that 
this is over...I&#39;ll deal with you later.&quot;

Violet grew worried again at the small sly smile she saw creep on her 
idol&#39;s lips.
