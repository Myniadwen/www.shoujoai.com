<h1>Promises Past (part 1 of 3)</h1>

<pre>The lunch bell was still buzzing as Juri walked quickly through the mob 
of underclassmen in the hallway, not seeming to notice or care that they 
parted quickly in front of her.

&quot;There she goes.&quot;

&quot;See! I told you it&#39;s true!&quot; hushed whispers rang behind her. Her lips 
twitched, then broke into a frown as she rounded the corner and saw 
Kozue standing with several other girls.

&quot;Kozue.&quot; she said sternly, bearing down on the group with a look that 
caused the other girls to draw together timidly behind Kozue, who turned 
and smiled brightly at Juri.

&quot;Oh! How nice to see you here, Juri!&quot; her voice was as bright as her 
smile. Juri scowled and put her hands on her hips, looking down at the 
girl.

&quot;I need to speak with you.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a request. Kozue crossed her books 
in front of her chest and shrugged nonchalantly, still smiling.

&quot;I&#39;m all yours.&quot; Kozue responded, and some of the girls behind her 
stifled giggles. Juri shot them a look that hushed them immediately.

&quot;Privately.&quot; she commanded, pointing toward an empty classroom. She 
turned her heel and strode away. Kozue merrily waved to her friends and 
trotted after her. Once inside, Juri clicked the door shut firmly. Kozue 
went to the nearest desk and sat on it, swinging her legs idly. Juri 
crossed her arms and gave her a contemplative stare. After a moment she 
began to pace the room, hands behind her back.

&quot;It has come to my attention that there are rumors circulating here that 
you and I are...&quot; she stopped to shake her head in disbelief, then 
resumed her pacing. &quot;That you and I are involved in some sort of 
relationship.&quot; she waved her hand at Kozue, who had opened her mouth to 
speak. &quot;Not only that, but rather graphic descriptions of 
this...relationship have been given.&quot; she put her hands to either side 
of her head, softly pulling at her hair in bewilderment. &quot;Truly bizarre 
things like-&quot;

&quot;Sexy alpha she-wolf.&quot; Kozue interjected. Juri&#39;s hands dropped and her 
mouth followed suit.

&quot;Wha-what?&quot;

&quot;Sexy alpha she-wolf. That&#39;s what I said.&quot; Kozue slid off the desk, her 
eyes on Juri.

&quot;You said that? You started all this? What the hell-&quot;

&quot;It has come to my attention that you have the most beautiful body I&#39;ve 
ever seen, and I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on it.&quot; Kozue started 
towards the stunned fencer, her eyes on a certain part of Juri&#39;s anatomy 
that caused Juri to cross her arms defensively in front of her chest.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare touch me.&quot; Juri glowered. Kozue put her hands behind her 
back and walked up to Juri, standing so close that her breasts touched 
Juri&#39;s crossed arms.

&quot;I&#39;m warning you Kozue, back off.&quot; Juri hissed.

&quot;Back off yourself. I&#39;m not moving.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re an insolent girl.&quot;

&quot;No, just horny.&quot; Kozue&#39;s smile was more of a leer, and she rubbed 
herself suggestively against Juri&#39;s arms.

Juri gave a snort of disgust and stepped back. &quot;And to think your 
brother&#39;s such a nice boy-&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t get laid, and I do.&quot;

Juri&#39;s eyes widened in shock, but she quickly composed herself and shook 
her head at the girl. &quot;Go find someone else to play this game with, 
Kozue.&quot; Juri said flatly, dropping her arms back down to her sides. &quot;I&#39;m 
not interested.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a game. You&#39;re the kind of person that appreciates honesty. 
And I can honestly say that ever since I saw you come out of that shower 
in the gym two days ago, I&#39;ve wanted you. Badly.&quot; she closed her eyes 
and slid her hand down her uniform, bunching it up between her legs as 
she slowly raised it. &quot;If you could only see what the thought of you 
does to me...&quot;

&quot;Kozue!&quot; Juri cried out in sheer alarm, grabbing the girl&#39;s wrist. Kozue 
grabbed Juri&#39;s hand and pushed it up between her legs, causing Juri&#39;s 
mouth to open in amazement. Kozue promptly seized her opportunity, 
catching Juri&#39;s mouth with her own. Juri stumbled backwards into the 
blackboard, Kozue in hot pursuit.

&quot;Damn you!&quot; Juri growled, defending her body against the passionate 
onslaught. It took several minutes of determined wrestling and cursing, 
but finally she pinned Kozue head-first into the blackboard, twisting 
the girl&#39;s arms behind her back, pressing her firmly with her own body 
so she could no longer move. They were both breathing heavily from the 
exertion, and Juri leaned heavily into Kozue, catching her breath. Kozue 
tried to move and Juri twisted her arm further, causing her to wince.

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t. You don&#39;t go anywhere till I let you.&quot; she growled 
out, smiling at the wince on Kozue&#39;s face. Kozue&#39;s left cheek was 
pressed into the blackboard, her eyes closed in a grimace. There was a 
rustling sound and Juri&#39;s smile disappeared as she realized the 
classroom door was now open, with several students standing in it, 
mouths agape.

&quot;Get out!&quot; Juri barked. The door slammed and Juri could feel Kozue&#39;s 
body under her own, rocking with laughter. &quot;Shit.&quot; Juri hung her head, 
her chin almost to Kozue&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Kozue, what have you done?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. You won&#39;t give me a chance.&quot; Kozue quipped. Her hands groped 
Juri&#39;s belly through her uniform.

&quot;Kozue! That&#39;s enough!&quot; Juri angrily flung the girl to the floor. &quot;I am 
not playing with you!&quot; Sensing she meant it, Kozue remained still on the 
floor. Juri stood over her, shaking, trying to regain control. She 
cleared her throat several times before speaking. &quot;I am not having this 
sort of interaction with you again.&quot;

Kozue remained silent, her head bowed. The room was still, filled only 
by their heavy breathing.

&quot;Are you listening to me? &quot; Juri grabbed Kozue&#39;s face with her hand and 
pulled her head up. &quot;Look at me. I want this to end here. Understand?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll end it.... if you look me in the eye... and honestly tell me 
you&#39;re not wet too.&quot; Kozue&#39;s voice was husky, heaving, and her eyes 
burned into Juri&#39;s. The look of intensity caused Juri&#39;s mouth to open 
slightly and she dropped her hand, taking a step backward. Without 
speaking, she turned and went to the door. &quot;You&#39;re an illiterate slut.&quot; 
she said dismissively, and slammed the door shut behind her.</pre>
