<a href="../utena/obnox-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; Kozue growled, the blue
haired young woman glaring at the young man in front
of her. Lum pressed herself to Kozue&#39;s back, looking
over her shoulder fearfully.

&quot;Come on, all I want is a bit of payback now that her
powers are gone...&quot; the young man complained right
before Kozue punched him in the face. There was a odd
crunching noise as she did do, and when he staggered
back blood ran down his nose.

&quot;Lum may be helpless but I&#39;m not,&quot; Kozue rubbed her
aching knuckles as she continued irritably, &quot;get
lost!&quot;

&quot;Oh you are going to pay for that,&quot; he howled as he
fled.

&quot;Coward,&quot; Kozue muttered right before she was nearly
tackled from behind,

&quot;Thank you, Darling!&quot; Lum hugged Kozue fiercely, the
black haired girl pressing her bikini clad body firmly
against Kozue&#39;s back.

Kozue blushed darkly, feeling a sudden flash of heat
pulse through her at that innocent contact. Pushing
those now frequently occurring feelings aside she
answered Lum gruffly, &quot;It&#39;s all right, Lum. I couldn&#39;t
let them hurt you when you&#39;ve temporarily lost your
powers.&quot;

Lum moved up to stand at Kozue&#39;s side and then they
set off together towards the East dorm. &quot;It&#39;ll only be
two or three more days,&quot; she said to Kozue
reassuringly, &quot;then everything will be back to
normal.&quot;

Seeing how nervous Lum seemed Kozue put her arm
comfortingly around Lum&#39;s shoulder. Lum smiled and
leaned into Kozue slightly, resting her head on
Kozue&#39;s shoulder. Trying to ignore how nice this felt
she asked, &quot;So why did you powers fail this morning
when you tried to zap Kiryuu for peeping?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my time of the month,&quot; Lum sheepishly confessed,
&quot;and the changes in my body during this time makes it
impossible to use my powers.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Kozue blinked, blushing faintly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Lum snuggled closer to Kozue&#39;s side as
she cheerfully explained, &quot;I&#39;ll be back to normal
soon.&quot;

Kozue could feel her pulse race as Lum pressed her
pert breasts into Kozue&#39;s side as she walked, the
warmth of Lum&#39;s gaze. More and more as the weeks had
passed she had found herself becoming aware of Lum&#39;s
physical beauty, despite all of her efforts to deny
it.

&quot;Oh, now what?&quot; Kozue growled out as she saw a
familiar figure standing there waiting impatiently by
the dorm.

Arisugawa Juri looked up as they neared, the orange
haired school council member dressed in her unique
variation on the usual uniform. Her long legs were
sheathed in white pants and her breasts were concealed
beneath her military style jacket.

&quot;Are you here about that idiot Kiryuu?&quot; Kozue
demanded.

&quot;Yes, but not the way you think,&quot; Juri said seriously
as she swiftly reached out and shook Kozue&#39;s hand.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kozue blinked.

&quot;I&#39;m pretty certain that a large number of ladies at
Ohtori are going to want to thank you for knocking
President Kiryuu off that ladder,&quot; Juri smiled
charmingly.

&quot;Hands of my darling,&quot; Lum scowled cutely.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Juri unconsciously reached up to
finger the locket she wore, &quot;I already have a ball and
chain.&quot;

&quot;Humph,&quot; Lum looked unimpressed.

&quot;You do have another problem, though,&quot; Juri said with
a compassionate smile as she focused her attention on
Kozue.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Kozue asked, wondering what fresh complication
was coming.

&quot;Nanami Kiryuu is... more than a little upset about
her big brother being hurt by you,&quot; Juri revealed.

Kozue groaned softly. Even she was aware of Nanami&#39;s
infatuation with her brother and the unhealthy lengths
she&#39;d go to pursue it. Of course she&#39;d be upset at her
brother&#39;s injuries and if the stories were right
Nanami&#39;d be out for revenge.

&quot;Any idea what she&#39;s got planned?&quot; Kozue asked wryly.

&quot;You already punched out one of her minions,&quot; Juri
said wryly, &quot;subtlety is not one of Nanami&#39;s strong
suits.&quot;

&quot;For Nanami!&quot; a group of young men cried as they burst
from the woods nearby carrying wooden practice swords.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Juri produced a sword from nowhere and
tossed it to Kozue.

&quot;Where did that come from?&quot; Kozue caught it as Juri
drew another sword.

&quot;I&#39;m a anime lesbian,&quot; Juri said confidently, &quot;I&#39;m
always prepared!&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Kozue sweat dropped as the first of the young
men reached them. She ducked below a blow then
slashed, slicing the wooden sword in half.

Juri was poetry in motion as she ducked in struck,
slashing weapons apart with lethal grace. &quot;This is the
best Nanami could do?&quot; she scoffed.

&quot;Darling, look out,&quot; Lum cried then there was a
muffled cry.

Wheeling around Kozue saw Lum crumpled to the ground,
a blonde haired girl with a smug look standing over
her. &quot;You hurt my brother,&quot; Nanami said coldly, &quot;and I
am going to punish you personally.&quot;

&quot;Nanami, how dare you...&quot; Juri started.

&quot;No,&quot; Kozue&#39;s voice vibrated with barely contained
rage, &quot;she&#39;s mine.&quot;

&quot;Oh ho ho ho ho,&quot; Nanami laughed as she hefted her
sword, &quot;do you really think...&quot;

SMACK!

Completely disregarding her weapon Kozue hammered
Nanami across the face with her first, sending her
staggering backward. &quot;You hurt someone I care for very
much,&quot; she growled, &quot;do you think I&#39;m playing fencing
games with you?!&quot;

&quot;Wait just a moment,&quot; Nanami&#39;s eyes were wide with
surprise and just a bit of fear.

&quot;Kozue...?&quot; Lum blinked dazedly, looking on with wide
eyes.

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Kozue tackled her, hammering a fist into
Nanami&#39;s gut. She grabbed Nanami by her braid and
drove her head into the turf.

&quot;Miss Nanami!&quot; one of the men moved to help only to be
stopped by Juri.

&quot;This is between them,&quot; Juri held up her sword,
&quot;unless you&#39;d care to face me?&quot; The men looked at each
other then stepped back as Juri smiled coldly,
&quot;Thought not.&quot;

Nanami managed to wriggle free of Kozue&#39;s furious
grip, leaving some hair behind in the process. &quot;You
barbarian,&quot; she said through tearful eyes, &quot;you hurt
my brother!&quot; She tried to throw a punch, but was
clearly unused to this sort of direct confrontation.

&quot;And you hurt someone I love,&quot; Kozue punched Nanami in
the face.

&quot;Oeee,&quot; Nanami made a incoherent noise, swaying there
a moment. Then she gracefully fell backward, hitting
the ground with a thump out cold.

Kozue turned to the shocked boys, &quot;Get her out of
here. And when she wakes up tell her this: if she
tries this again I&#39;ll do even worse.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Ma&#39;am,&quot; the boys bundled up the bloody and dirty
Nanami and fled.

Kozue sighed tiredly, taking in her own soiled clothes
and dirty hands. &quot;What else can go wrong?&quot; she
muttered.

&quot;DARLING!&quot; Lum tackle glomped her to the ground.

&quot;Ack!&quot; Kozue gasped.

&quot;You said you cared for me,&quot; Lum squealed, &quot;you love
me! I&#39;m so happy!&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean...&quot; Kozue stammered as she rolled over,
Lum perching on her chest, &quot;I mean, I did mean it but
not...&quot;

Lum swooped forward and kissed Kozue lingeringly,
silencing her. &quot;Thank you for fighting for me,
beloved,&quot; she said simply.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll just leave you two alone,&quot; Juri said
with some amusement as she left them still talking on
the lawn.

End

Notes: A shout out to Strife for reminding me this fic
exists. Lol. I wanted Kozue to admit to caring for Lum
at least, and I thought her doing it in the heat of
the moment was believable.</pre>
