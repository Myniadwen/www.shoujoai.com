<pre>Summons 


Anthy ran as fast as her legs could carry her, her chest heaving as she 
fought to get air in her lungs. Her violet hair flew out behind her like 
a banner, her delicate dusky skin torn and bleeding. She was certainly a 
sight: a badly clothed young woman running barefoot up the rocky 
mountain path, brambles stuck in her hair and thorns caught on her 
flimsy red dress.

The red of the dress did little to mask the blood from a thousand cuts 
and bruises. She had stains on her dirty face where tears had run tracks 
along her cheeks. With a panic, she snatched at branches and wind raped 
trees out of her way as she climbed ever higher. There wasn&#39;t much time, 
she had to hurry! Already she could hear the baying of hounds.

Gasping and sobbing in pain and exhaustion, the far-too-slender girl 
grabbed ahold of an outcropping of rock and hoisted herself up along the 
now vertical face of the mountain. She was almost there, if only....

Horses hooves sounded below her, and the shouting began as they caught 
sight of her ardent flapping cloth. No, not now! She was so close. She 
wouldn&#39;t have much time if they were this close behind her. She tried to 
move faster, fingers aching and beginning to bleed. Suddenly those 
slender fingers slipped off of her next handhold, and she dangled 
dangerously by one arm. Her feet scrabbled in the air to connect with 
the rock wall, as she gave a startled cry. Another, far more cruel cry 
came from below.

&quot;We&#39;ve finally found you, Anthy! I&#39;ll see to it your filthy witch&#39;s hide 
is severely punished for your disobedience and insolence. You will be 
MINE tonight, his majesty has promised it!&quot; A man on horseback rested 
coolly in the saddle, licking his lips in sadistic anticipation. 
Flipping wavy vermilion hair over his broad armored shoulders, he 
signaled his armed forces to split and begin heading up the mountain 
passes. They&#39;d get her...she had nowhere to go. She was trapped and 
would soon be shrieking for her crimes. It filled the man with a sick 
sort of pleasure.

The girl struggled, her teeth gritted against her terror and 
desperation. Finally she was able to get back her handhold after several 
wild lunges, and shaking she continued her ascent. With that heavy black 
armor, those soldiers would have a hard time following her up this way. 
They&#39;d have to go up the longer paths. It bought her some time at least. 
She pulled her tired hurting body over the top edge of the small cliff, 
resting for a moment on her back. 

Her gasps and coughs were muffled slightly by the rushing, roaring wind. 
To her right, the mouth of the cave yawned like the maul of a beast. 
Darkness, blacker than anything natural, was all she could see inside. 
Anthy climbed to her feet and unsteadily moved toward it.

But before she could walk into the entrance, a shimmering green 
forcefield flared into existence, and stopped her as completely as a 
stone wall. She doubled over slightly in pain, clutching her nose and 
forehead. Wincing she craned back her neck. There...the sigil...the 
crest of the Ohtori royal family was carved in stark relief from the 
mountain face. It stood out like a warning over top the opening of the 
sacred cave. A smaller version of it graced a strange handle, jutting 
out at the side of the cave opening. Was it a handle to &#39;open the door&#39; 
to the forcefield?

Recalling the ancient texts she had secretly poured through for years, 
the dusty scrolls of diagrams and incantations she had managed to 
glimpse in between her duties at the palace, she cleared her mind in 
meditation in order to summon her power. Almost as if another spoke 
through her, using her vocal cords and burning the words into her mind, 
she spoke.

&quot;Rose of the Noble Castle, I call you in the name of my ancestors...&quot; 
Raising a blood soaked hand, damaged from her treacherous climb, she 
wiped it across the rose shaped relief on the top part of the ornate 
stone handle. The red smear made the rose blaze a brilliant red, as if 
giving it life. Acting on intuition, the girl with the emerald eyes 
kneeled so she was eye level with the handle and gently wrapped slender 
hands about it.

&quot;Taste of my blood, and know I am of true birth. Hear my summons...know 
my heart...grant me rightful access to the home of the Guardian!&quot;

She rested her forehead against the rose sigil, as if bowing in some 
kind of prayer. Like a stamp, her blood came away sticky on her skin 
when she lifted her head again. For a moment she crouched there, unsure 
of what to do next. Had she messed up the ritual? Did she forget to do 
something...what was left?

A rumble sounded from within the rock&#39;s core as bits of chalky debris 
rained down on her from above. Frightened, she cowered against the door 
handle, but quickly jerked back in surprise. The stone...it was hot. The 
rose symbol was still shining red, but oddly it seemed shinier than 
before. Anthy lifted fingertips to her brow, only to discover the 
imprint on her forehead was gone. What on earth? She leaned closer to 
peer at the door handle, and watched in fascination.

The handle was cracking. Chips and flakes of stone fell away, revealing 
shining perfect metal work underneath. As the stone skin sloughed off, a 
burning white light outlined where it was attached to the mountainside. 
And then it began to lift out of the wall!

Pushing outward with a metallic rasp, Anthy stood spellbound as its true 
form revealed itself. Hesitantly she held out her hands to take the 
slender, beautifully crafted sword. The steel was as polished as a 
mirror, and her own bedraggled face gazed up at her. This handle...was a 
sword handle. Was this the key to let her in?

Moving to stand before the cave opening once more, remembering sharply 
that she was pressed for time, she took the gleaming sword in hand and 
touched the tip to the forcefield like a magician&#39;s wand. The forcefield 
flashed brighter and then winked out of existence. A grin of dizzy 
happiness broke out on the girl&#39;s face. She had done it! Now to awaken 
the Guardian before it was too late... With a forced resolve, she 
stepped into the belly of the beast.

Using her hand along the wall to guide her, she shuffled forward and 
winced now and then as a sharp pebble stabbed upward into the tender 
meat of her feet. She continued walking into the pitch darkness, her 
heartbeat sounding too loud in her ears. The wind roaring past the lip 
of the cave opening could no longer be heard.

As she moved deeper, she became aware of the sound of running water in 
the dark up ahead. Was it her imagination? There seemed to be a faint 
glow shining up ahead. Hurrying faster, Anthy shakily made her way into 
a stone carved shrine room. Strips of prayers and incantations fluttered 
idly on crisscrossing ropes like the webs of an insane spider. The room 
was choked with them. A circle of water, bubbling from an unseen spring, 
circled a suit of armor standing immobile in it&#39;s dead center. The girl 
halted before it.

It was...beautiful...and deadly at the same time. She gazed upon a 
shining white armor covered in thick plates and wicked spikes on the 
shoulder guards and arm guards. The helmet&#39;s face mask was reminiscent 
of a stone golem, or maybe the craggy face of a demon. Shadowed eye 
holes stared back at her intently, as if peering into the witch&#39;s very 
soul.

Mustering her strength, and trying to quell that knot of fear that 
tightened in her gut, Anthy lifted the sword and began hacking and 
slicing at the ropes in her way. Even in her inexperienced hands, the 
mystical sword sliced as cleanly as a hot knife through butter. Tattered 
prayers from priests long since forgotten, crumbled and fell to the 
floor, to be trodden on carelessly. She kept going through the maze, 
straight through the water, and up to the crest emblazoned armor.

Now that she was closer, the dark skinned girl could see it was a full 
head and a half higher than her, and bulkier as well. Truly the armor of 
a great warrior. Strange mystical glyphs and patterns swirled and ran 
across it&#39;s polished white surface. They were embossed in the finest 
silver. Her eyes followed the complicated pattern up one arm, across the 
shoulder, and down to rest dead center of the breast plate. The 
intricate web had formed a grand design in the center...a stylized 
version of the rose seen on the outside of the cave. The rose crest of 
the Ohtori family.

But something was missing. Peering even closer, she noticed tiny 
mechanical gears and locking devices in a gaping hole. The core of the 
armor was gone. Looking up and seeing odd mushrooms growing along the 
walls (the source of the room&#39;s lighting) she plucked one and used it to 
illuminate the hole. It was a roundish keyhole. She needed the 
mechanical key to activate the Guardian.

Boot scrapes from behind her at the cave&#39;s opening sent ice through her 
veins and her brain reeling in panic once more. They were here, and now 
the cave was open! She was out of time, she had to hurry up the 
procedure. Fumbling under her garments, she produced an oily cloth 
wrapped about a chunk of metal the size of her fist. The footsteps were 
running now.

Nearly dropping it in her haste, Anthy tore off the wrapping, revealing 
a three-dimensional, stylized, metal rose. She paid no heed to the 
metallic projections underneath its bottom or stop to look at the hair 
thin details crafted on it&#39;s petals. She had already gazed at it 
lovingly hundreds of times. Leaping to her feet, she began slapping it 
against the metal breastplate, making clinking noises. But her hands 
were shaking too badly to line it up properly, and it wouldn&#39;t fit in 
the slot.

&quot;Anthy! I&#39;ve caught you now, my lovely witch!&quot;

An iron grip snagged her by the hair and wrenched her head painfully 
backwards. She distantly felt her fingers click the rose into place as 
she cried out in pain. Her body was flung onto the rock floor of the 
room. The lovely green haired general stood over her, a sneer contorting 
his otherwise handsome good looks. &quot;And what have we here? Dabbling in 
forbidden black magic, I see? Entering a forbidden holy place, and 
tainting it with your dark sin? His majesty will not be pleased.&quot; He 
moved forward to grab her by the arm, dragging her up to force her 
bodily into him. She whimpered and made to struggle, but suddenly they 
both halted. The sound of rotating gears and clicking parts sounded 
behind them.

Both he and Anthy turned and looked on as the rose in the breast plate 
slowly turned in it&#39;s slot, as if by an invisible hand. When it had 
painstakingly completed one full rotation, a grinding metallic sound 
came forth and echoed about the room as the rose seemed to creak into 
the chest. As it disappeared slowly from view, a door slid down hiding 
the key from view. The panel had a silver worked rose, a flat design 
identical to the key upon its surface. Seamlessly, the edges of the 
panel magically fused until it was a solid breastplate. A whir and a 
hum, and blue lights in the shape of eyes flared to life behind the face 
mask.

The Guardian had awakened.

General Saionji wasted no time drawing his sword and snatching Anthy up 
by the throat, holding his blade out as a clear threat. &quot;What have you 
done, she-devil! What evil have you brought forth?&quot; The armor took a 
creaking step forward, then another one, steam hissing out of the joints 
in the legs and neck. It went robotically to one knee, heedless of the 
sword pointed at it.

A muffled low monotone voice resounded from that frightening helm. &quot;My 
lady...I am yours to command.&quot;

Anthy gave a gasping cough, feeling bruises being imprinted in her neck 
as she vainly fought her captor. Choking out a desperate cry she managed 
to get words out, &quot;P-protect me!&quot;

The green haired black knight shoved Anthy into the wall and flew 
forward with sword lifted high. &quot;I&#39;ll kill your familiar! And then I&#39;ll 
make you PAY!&quot; With a bellow of rage he brought the sword down, only to 
have it jerk to a sudden unexpected halt between a pair of gauntleted 
hands. With clicking gears, the armored figure in white stood from it&#39;s 
kneeling position, only slightly shorter than the shocked general.

The general himself was pressing down with all of his strength, trying 
to force his enemy to the ground. But to no avail, the figure bore up 
with no effort. Anthy fought a wave of nausea, and pulled herself to a 
sitting position. The sword...had to get...the sword... With her fading 
strength, she picked up the Holy Sword, and gave a sloppy toss in the 
Guardian&#39;s general direction.

Shockingly, the slow hulking form snapped an arm out faster than thought 
and caught the sword fluidly. It was far different from its earlier 
movements, and this was not lost on either the witch or the grunting 
black general. With an uncanny speed, it shoved back the green haired 
man, and came to a fighting stance with sword at the ready. The sword 
and knight seemed as one...each a perfect compliment to the other.

The scowling black knight lifted his own sword offensively. &quot;Get back 
demon! I&#39;ll send you back to hell!&quot; He lunged forward, steel whistling 
with power and nightmarish speed. Years of harsh training and combat 
fueled by hate powering that strike. Sparks flew as it was smoothly 
parried, and the man was sent stumbling. Turning his foiled strike 
around into a cutting arc, he was blocked again by that shining then 
blade. He gave an enraged cry and began hacking and cutting at the 
silent moving armor, sparks lighting up the dim cavern. Again and again 
and again they met, before the Guardian&#39;s low even voice broke through 
the silence.

&quot;My lady...shall I eliminate him?&quot;

Anthy came up out of her haze, having been so preoccupied by watching 
the two powerful fighters dance and whirl about the room. Temptation 
seeped into her, but instead she painfully shook her head as she spoke. 
&quot; N-no, you mustn&#39;t kill him! He is one of the king&#39;s generals...we 
can&#39;t insight his wrath with his death!&quot; The room spun as her head gave 
a nauseating throb.

The masked clockwork armor gave a crisp nod to itself, and faster than 
the eye could follow stepped into it&#39;s opponent&#39;s lunge, Twisting 
skillfully to avoid the blade, it brought the hilt of it&#39;s own sword 
down on the surprised man&#39;s neck. A grunt, and a stumble, then he was 
down with his eyes rolled up in his skull. The sound of him crashing 
into the ground reverberated about the damp walls. Kicking the body 
away, the armor moved over to where Anthy cowered, looking suddenly 
fearful at the thing approaching her. Seeming to sense her unease, it 
stopped a bit away from her and once more fell to one knee.

&quot;I am ready to serve you...my Princess.&quot;
