<a href="../utena/swordstone-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Utena and Anthy walked together to their morning classes. The sun was 
shining down on another beautiful day at Ohtori. &quot;Utena-sama,&quot; Anthy 
started, smiling shyly at her, &quot;I just wanted to say how much I...&quot;

&quot;Good morning, Utena-sama,&quot; the crowd of giggling girls said as they 
looked Utena over admiringly.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Utena waved back cheerfully, ignoring the girl&#39;s hungry 
gazes. She turned to Anthy, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what was that?&quot;

Anthy just sighed. &quot;Never mind, Utena-sama. It wasn&#39;t anything 
important.&quot;

Before Anthy could try to say anything else, Juri and Nanami joined 
them. Nanami was smirking slightly, as Juri stepped up beside Utena. 
&quot;Good morning, Utena-sama. You look terrific as usual.&quot; Juri said 
charmingly.

Utena sweatdropped. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said quietly. Nanami smiled as 
she noticed Anthy staring daggers at Juri. Juri checked her watch, 
apologized, and headed for her classes. Nanami just shook her head as 
Utena and Anthy walked off.

&#39;How can Utena be so blind?&#39; Nanami asked herself. &#39;Anthy certainly 
has it bad for her.&#39;

------------------------------------------------------------

Nanami walked in the gardens later that day, enjoying the sun and the 
warm breeze. She smiled a bit, as she recognized a friend of hers. 
&quot;Hi, Shiori,&quot; she said. The pretty young woman was sitting on a bench, 
looking down.

&quot;Hey, Nanami.&quot; Shiori sighed sadly. &quot;Grab a seat.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Nanami asked, sitting down by Shiori.

&quot;I just can&#39;t get her to notice me!&quot; Shiori ranted, echoing what Juri 
had said earlier.

Nanami sweatdropped. &quot;Not Tenjou Utena, I hope?&quot; she said dubiously.

Shiori looked at her quizzically. &quot;No, Juri,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s driving 
me nuts!&quot; she complained.

Nanami smiled, a small, devious smile that struck fear in the hearts 
of teachers and authority figures everywhere. &quot;I have an idea,&quot; she 
said, and leaned over to whisper in Shiori&#39;s ear.

Shiori&#39;s eyes got wider and wider as she listened. &quot;No way,&quot; Shiori 
said frowning. &quot;I&#39;m not sure how that would help, she&#39;d still be hung 
up on...&quot;

&quot;Then you...&quot; and Nanami continued whispering. Shiori got a thoughtful 
look on her face.

&quot;You know, it just might work,&quot; Shiori said. With a broad smile, she 
gave Nanami a hug.

------------------------------------------------------------

Behind a nearby tree, Juri watched the two of them talk. She was too 
far away to hear what was said; she didn&#39;t even know why she had 
concealed herself. She saw them sitting close together, then Nanami 
leaned beside Shiori and began whispering in her ear. Juri may not 
have been able to hear them, but she could imagine what Nanami might 
be saying.

Juri frowned as she felt a pang of jealousy. &#39;Why shouldn&#39;t Shiori 
have someone?&#39; she wondered. &#39;Why does it bother me, seeing Shiori 
with Nanami?&#39; Distracted, it took Juri a moment to realize they had 
gotten up and were quickly walking towards her. &#39;What do I do?!&#39; she 
thought frantically.

Desperate, Juri grabbed a low branch and as quietly as possible 
climbed up the tree and out of sight. They passed beneath her still 
talking. Juri finally relaxed a bit once they were out of sight. 
&quot;Whew, that was close,&quot; Juri said softly. She suddenly lost her grip 
on the branch and clattered to the ground, &quot;Owe!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Anthy looked over at Utena across the dining room table. They were 
alone there, the only residents of the newly reopened hall, and Anthy 
knew now was the time to tell her. She got up and poured more tea for 
Utena, and smiled at her warmly.

&quot;Is everything all right, Utena-sama?&quot; Anthy asked. They sat across 
from each other, candles lit and a fine meal laid before them.

&quot;It&#39;s wonderful, Anthy.&quot; Utena said, smiling broadly. &quot;I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;ve ever ate as well as I have in the last few weeks.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Anthy said with a smile. She chuckled a bit, adding &quot;Even 
the first week when I burned everything?&quot;

Utena laughed, smiling. &quot;Compared to my cooking, it was great!&quot;

Anthy joined her in laughter, looking across the table at the oh so 
beautiful girl there. &#39;Now is the time,&#39; she thought. &quot;Utena, I want 
to tell you something. Over the last month, you have shown me such 
kindness and caring.&quot; Utena blushed brightly at that, but Anthy 
carried on, &quot;I have never known such care, and I wanted to tell you 
that I think I lo...&quot;

The overhead lights came on and Miki bounded into the room. &quot;Hey, 
dinner! Mind if I join you?&quot; he asked cheerfully. Anthy shot him a 
glare that would have killed a more sensitive man. &quot;What?&quot; he asked.

Anthy just sighed. </pre>
