<h1>Rose Petal Juri: Dear Diary</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mstenoh.html">MSTenoh14</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I hate things where authors want to give their life story before the 
fiction ,but I have to say a couple of things just so you can 
understand how I wrote this fic.

&gt; &lt; shows thoughts or actions.

*** is the usual change of scene.

~~~ means change of scene in the same time frame of the last ***.

&gt; &lt; means shared thoughts

And this is my first Utena fic so I hope you like it PLEASE give me 
feedback.

Okay that is about all,but one more thing! Juri is way OOC in this so 
don&#39;t get mad it will all be explained in the first paragraph! Now I&#39;m 
done. 

Okay just pretend to hear the &quot;boo&quot; when Shihori is mentioned...I hate 
her....

------------------------------------------------------------

Juri threw her head back, she groaned as she moved back and forth 
faster, the need to feel connected to someone, or something, was 
driving her in a primal fashion. She looked down, but the form beneath 
her, the other girl was solid black&#133; The two fingers pushed ever 
deeper into her canal hitting the lithe orange haired girls most 
sensitive regions driving her ever closer towards oblivion. Suddenly a 
flood of passion filtered through Juri&#146;s system, she held her head 
back and closed her eyes, spastically dancing over the other girls&#146; 
body.

She opened her eyes and in a hazy view she saw the face of her lover&#133;

Two stunningly blue eyes shimmering full of love and devotion smiled 
at her. &gt;This isn&#146;t Shihori-sempai&lt; thought Juri. &gt;This is something 
more&lt; The pink haired form under her withdrew from inside, and pulled 
her into a gentle kiss.

A kiss

A light

A soft

A warm

A loving

Kiss.

Utena pulled the cover over them that had been long knocked over 
during their strenuous lovemaking. &gt;Lovemaking?&lt; thought Juri &gt;I made 
love! Do I love her? What about Shihori-san&lt;

Finally she realized Utena was saying something, knocked out of her 
thoughts she focused on the younger girl.

&#147;Earth to Juri, Juri please come in&#148; giggled Utena using a voice that 
sounded distorted by static.

&#147;Sorry sempai. I just got caught up in my thoughts.&#148;

Utena smiled warmly &#147;Penny?&#148;

&#147;Oh, it was nothing.&#148; Juri dismissed the offer to listen and buried 
her face in the hollow of Utena&#146;s neck. Savoring the smell of love and 
memorizing the safe feeling that had alluded her for years, now found 
lying in bed with Tenjou Utena.

((((((((((RRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG))))))))

Juri was knocked out of the dream by the alarm clocks annoying sounds. 
She slapped her hand down on the clock to shut it off. It was time for 
her 5 a.m. jog. Juri sighed wishing she could hold on to that dream 
forever. She finally went to the bathroom; some days you just wish you 
woke up at 6.

***

Utena yawned and looked over the edge of the top bunk.

&#147;Hmmm I wonder where Anthy could have gone off to?&#148;

Utena jumped off the bed and looked at the clock &gt;5 a.m.&lt;

&#147;Anthy where are you?&#148; the athletic pink haired girl called out.

&#147;Tenjou-san I am in the kitchen.&#148; Was the soft reply from the dark 
skinned, purple haired girl. Utena couldn&#146;t help but to think of how 
much she loved Anthys&#146; deep green eyes. Utena shook her head... &gt;It 
must be too early&lt;

&#147;Good morning Tenjou-san&#133;&#148;

&#147;Call me Utena&#148;

&#147;Hai.&#148;

&#147;Would you like something to eat?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148;

Anthy set out a plate and then went to the fridge and took out a fruit 
salad bowl.

Anthy smiled at Utena &#147;I&#146;m pleased to see you awake at such an hour.&#148;

As if on schedule Utena yawned &#147;I guess it&#146;s because I went to bed 
early.&#148;

Anthy started to eat and looked up. &#147;You can accompany me to the rose 
garden if you&#146;d like. I&#146;m going early so Chu-Chu and I can pull some 
weeds.&#148;

Utena thought for a moment and decided. &#147;Nah. I think I&#146;ll go for a 
jog or something.&#148;

Anthy lowered her head, &#147;As you wish Tenjou-san.&#148; and went back to 
eating.

Utena looked at Chu-Chu sleeping on the counter next to the toaster, 
the furry animal looked like a cross between a mouse and monkey. Never 
the less he was Anthy&#146;s best friend. She was sure the he&#146;d be awake 
soon to keep Anthy company. The tall blued eyed girl stuck her hand in 
the salad bowl and shoved a hand full of fruit in her mouth and went 
to the shower, smiling at the half amused half disgusted face Anthy 
was making.

 

***

Juri rounded the bend as she turned up the volume on her Walkman. The 
national fencing champions long usually curly hair was done in a 
ponytail and she only wore a sports bra and sweat pants. Most people 
wouldn&#146;t even believe it was her if they had seen her. But, some 
things you couldn&#146;t change, her tall slender yet muscular frame was 
proudly on display, the lean torso leading up to a very firm and 
generous chest. And of course her, orange and fire tinted hair always 
gave her away&#133;

Not noticing her surroundings she collided with someone.

&#147;Ouch!&#148; Utena yelped as she ungracefully hit the ground.

Juri looked over to Utena and stood. Juri offered Utena her hand and 
helped her up.

&#147;I am sorry, I wasn&#146;t watching where I was going.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s all right neither was I.&#148; Commented the younger girl.

&#147;You know what Juri?&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; asked Juri slightly puzzled.

&#147;You look nice like that, like a normal girl&#133; I think you look 
prettier with straight hair. Sorta&#146; like a normal girl you know. Not 
that any one would want you to be normal ,because your great now, even 
if you are mean some times.&#148; Then Utena realized she was rambling.

Juri felt her face grow hot as she blushed deeply. Utena&#146;s eyes grew 
wide as cold as ice Arisugawa Juri was turning beet red over a comment 
she had made.

&#147;T-t-thanks.&#148; Juri said growing uncomfortable with her lack of 
control.

She still didn&#146;t know whether to be upset at Utena for making her 
blush or to be happy she thought she was pretty.

&#147;Got anywhere to be Tenjou-san?&#148;

&#147;No, I&#146;m just on a run.&#148;

&#147;Do you want to join me?&#148; she didn&#146;t wait for an answer she just 
jogged ahead, hoping to gain some control.

Soon Utena had fallen in step keeping up with Juri, a feat that even 
student council president Kiryuu Touga could not manage. They jogged 
in a pleasant silence for a bit then Juri pulled off her headphones.

&#147;Utena?&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148; Utena noted that Juri was making an effort to say her name 
instead of the formal Tenjou-san.

&quot;What do you think the revolution is? What are we fighting for?&quot;

&gt;That was surprising&lt; thought Utena with a thoughtful expression on 
her face.

&quot;Well... I don&#39;t know about the revolution. I just want Anthy to be 
normal like everyone else.&quot;

&quot;Is that all?&quot; questioned Juri,&quot;What of your prince?&quot;

Utena blushed. She knew most of the End of the World fighters were 
aware of her quest to find her prince, but it sounded different coming 
from Juri. Almost as if she was searching too....

Juri looked at Utena&#39;s reddening face and then at the ground.

She spoke in a whisper, &quot;I-it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to talk about 
it with me after how I&#39;ve treated you. I know I&#39;m not-&quot;

Utena cut her off, &quot;No, it&#39;s o.k. it&#39;s just that it&#39;s strange you ask, 
your so different today. Like something or someone has changed you. I 
think I like this you better.&quot;

It was Juri&#39;s turn to blush.

&quot;My prince. I know I will find him. What will happen after that is 
what I wonder about. What will I do with Anthy? If I am her prince 
will I leave her? Will she...&quot; Utena stopped, realizing she was 
telling her inner most thoughts to a girl that she barely knew.

&gt;beep beep beep beep&lt;

Utena looked at her watch. &quot;Class starts in a hour. I need to get back 
home and change.&quot;

&quot;It would be quicker to just change in the girls locker room, I&#39;m sure 
you have a spare uniform there...everyone does.&quot;

&quot;Yeah your right it would be quicker.&quot; Utena gave Juri a friendly 
shove.

&quot;Race you slow poke!&quot; laughed the younger girl as she ran ahead with 
Juri on her tail.

***

The gyms changing room was empty, as the two girls entered not even 
the coaches were anywhere to be seen. Utena looked confused &quot;Umm, why 
isn&#39;t anyone in here Juri?&quot;

&quot;The first sports practice doesn&#39;t start until seven and I only have 
the key because I&#39;m on the student council.&quot;

Utena nodded, &quot;I see, do you have a key to everything around Ohtori?&quot;

Juri walked to her locker and got a towel and uniform out, &quot;The 
council members each have a skeleton key.&quot;

Utena nodded &gt;Hey, shouldn&#39;t I have one...I&#39;m not on the council but I 
am a duelist&lt; &quot;My locker is over here&quot;

Utena stood in front of the locker and gathered a towel and fresh 
uniform &gt;I&#39;m lucky Anthy put a spare in here last week&lt;, she thought 
as she closed the locker door.

The pair walked to the showers taking an empty bench next to the first 
stall.

&quot;Looks like they took out the dividers...&quot;

Utena blushed, &quot;Yeah, I think I&#39;ll wait until your done.&quot;

Juri was almost excited to see Utena nude; &quot;Is the brave, fearless 
duelist Tenjou Utena afraid to step into a shower unguarded?&quot;

Utena sweat dropped and stuck her tongue out at Juri &quot;Of course not I 
just thought you might be shy!&quot;

Juri laughed until she turned a deep shade of red,&#148; Sure Tenj- Utena&quot;

Juri stood up and pulled down her sweat pants revealing a pair of 
close fitting, low cut, Hanes panties made to look like men&#146;s briefs. 
Utena couldn&#39;t help but to look; almost as if she was willed to. The 
pink haired girl couldn&#39;t stop; Juri smiled, and then pouted &quot;No fair 
Utena! If I showed mine you show yours.&quot;

&quot;Well you see...&#148; Utena said as she put her arm behind her head in 
jester of discomfort.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I just kind of left today. I didn&#39;t put any on&quot;

Blood spurted out of Juri&#146;s nose, &quot;Well then I suppose it&#39;s on me 
again.&quot; She hooked her slim fingers around the edges of her underwear 
and slowly slid them down to her feet and kicked them off. Utena&#146;s 
eyes were two saucers, wide open; she never imagined that Juri would 
do that. The flame haired beauty was indeed orange all over, Juri&#146;s 
closely shaven pubic hairs matched her hair color perfectly. Utena was 
still staring lost in thought. &gt;Oh shit, damn it, damn it. Juri is 
hot! Is she hitting on me? Or is this just how Juri is? How will I 
explain this to Anthy&lt;, the pink haired girl thoughts were jumbling 
together.

&quot;Utena?&quot; Juri snapped her fingers.

&quot;Utena are you there?&#148;, she said as she waved her hand in front of the 
other girl.

&quot;Oh, what? Huh? Oh, yeah.&quot;

&quot;If it is too much for you I can put my panties back on.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; shouted Utena accidentally, &quot;I mean no, it&#39;s okay.&quot;, she said in 
almost a whisper.

&gt;I think she likes this&lt;, thought Juri.

&quot;Your turn Utena&quot; Juri looked over Utena&#146;s body.

Utena slowly stood and slid off her track pants revealing a closely 
shaven mound of pink hairs. Juri tried to clam her rapidly beating 
heart, she knew this was wrong but she couldn&#39;t help, but to stare at 
the trim hairs and vanilla skin.

&gt;I can&#39;t believe we are doing this.&lt;

Utena stepped forward and reached behind Juri&#146;s back.

&quot;Wha---&quot; was all Juri got out as Utena pulled the sports bra over her 
head. Their midsections were so close together if either girl would 
have moved forward they&#39;d touch; Utena stepped back and took in the 
sight of Juri&#146;s naked body. Her nipples were a beautiful dusty pink 
color and her breasts were deliciously round; the smaller girl 
unconsciously licked her lips. Juri stepped forward and took off 
Utena&#146;s shirt and next her bra...

Both girls hearts were beating fast, and so loudly they couldn&#39;t hear 
their own heavy breathing. Juri looked down at the smaller yet, 
proportioned chest of Utena. Her breasts were pert and her nipples 
were a shade lighter then her own, Utena&#146;s nipples were hardened which 
made them look plump. &gt;I wish I could taste them&lt; Juri caught were the 
thought was going, &gt;...this is so wrong.&lt;

Juri backed away and grabbed her wash towel, &quot;We should get in the 
shower, and you will be late for your study hall.&quot;

Utena snapped back to reality, &quot;Yeah.&quot; she grabbed her towel and 
followed the exiting Juri into to showers.

~~~

Juri turned the nozzle of the shower and the two were being sprayed by 
nice warm water.

Utena looked around and grabbed a soap off the rack in front of their 
shower and she washed her body, keeping her eyes off of Juri who was 
doing the same.

&gt;Too much has happened and the day hasn&#39;t even started&lt; sighed Utena 
at she thought. Juri went over to the rack and put up the soap and 
grabbed some shampoo, she squeezed some into her palm and was going to 
put it in her hair until she got a better idea. The tall tenth grader 
turned towards Utena and came and stood behind the pink haired 
athlete, then started to wash her hair. Juri enjoyed playing with the 
soft locks, turning the usual shampoo in to a massage, slowly running 
her finger through Utena&#146;s hair.

Utena was tense and afraid at first then she relaxed and let herself 
fall against Juri&#146;s muscular frame as Juri ran her fingers all over 
her head. &gt;Kami, Juri can give a massage. I wonder what her hand would 
feel like...&lt; Utena could feel Juri&#146;s body melded against hers. Her 
nipples were hard, and touching Utena&#146;s back and her mid-section was 
on Utena&#146;s bottom; it was as if they were built to fit together.

Utena willed herself to turn around and face Juri, &quot;My turn.&quot;

Utena got some shampoo and reached up to Juri, the other girl bent her 
head down, &quot;No I want to see you.&quot;

Juri nodded and stood erect again, Utena stood at the tips of her toes 
and gently put the shampoo into Juri&#146;s hair pushing it back. Suddenly 
Utena giggled and Juri opened her eyes.

&quot;What?&quot;

Utena covered her mouth and giggled some more. &quot;It&#39;s just that I never 
knew our ears were so pointy.&quot;

Utena was now openly laughing, &quot;They are always covered by your hair.&quot;

Juri frowned,&quot;I do it on purpose, I hate them. When I was a kid the 
other children called me Keebler.&quot;

Utena smiled at Juri,&quot;Well, I like them. They suit you.&quot; The younger 
girl pulled Juri down and kissed her right ear.

Juri blushed and Utena wrapped her in a strong embrace; way too strong 
for someone of her age, and led Juri back directly under the 
showerhead. The two washed the shampoo out of their hair, and then 
went to get dressed with no more conversation.

***

Wakaba stood under a secluded tree waiting for Utena, the two usually 
shared a bento and it was her favorite part of the day.

&quot;Utena! My darling, Utena. Where are you?&quot;

Wakaba looked around yet another time, &quot;5 minutes late! I will get you 
Tenjou Utena&quot;

The Greek girl went in to the cafeteria to ask if anyone had seen her 
&#39;boyfriend&#39;.

~~~

Utena was running through the halls trying to make it to the tree she 
usually met Wakaba at.

&quot;Stupid teacher, now I&#39;m late. Wakaba will never stop bothering me 
about it.&quot;

Utena stopped running and looked down from the second floor and saw 
Juri leaning against one of the pillars across the courtyard. The 
student council president Kiryuu Touga was walking over to her.

~~~

Touga walked over to the pillar and stood in front of Juri.

&quot;Do you want something Kiryuu?&quot;

Juri looked him in the eyes and he grinned.

&quot;Enjoy your shower this morning?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;You and Tenjou.&quot; Touga was actually impressed Juri could pull off 
such a feat and more than a little jealous; he did want Tenjou for 
himself.

&quot;I believe that is none of your business Touga.&quot; Juri&#146;s voice was cold 
and deep leaving no room for misunderstanding; to her the discussion 
was closed.

Touga used his usual soft playboy tone, &quot;Oh, come now. I hear you two 
were very...&quot; he paused and smiled &quot;...close.&quot;

Juri was ready to end the conversation &gt;That jerk, how does he know?&lt;

As if he could read her thoughts Touga commented, &quot;I have my ways 
Arisugawa...If you help me win the Rose Bride, Utena will be free and 
you can have her all to yourself.&quot;

Juri&#146;s eyes clouded and she glared at him &quot;You are despicable, I will 
have no part of that. I do not wish to possess Utena, she is no ones 
property!&quot;

&quot;Despicable? Am I really? Why all I want is for you to be happy and to 
revolutionize the world.&quot;

Juri was rapidly transforming back in to the her former icy self, 
&quot;Don&#39;t you ever assume anything like that with me again. I will never 
be one of your pawns like Kyouichi.&quot;

Touga ran his hand through his long red hair and gave a gentle laugh &quot; 
I did not mean to offend you-&quot; He grabbed her hand and kissed it &quot;-I 
apologize, sincerely.&quot;

Juri pulled her hand back forcefully, &quot;As you should be.&quot;

Touga turned and walked away front the younger girl. &gt;Damn, I thought 
I had her. Next time Arisugawa you will be a pawn.&lt;

~~~

Utena walked over to Juri after Touga left, she had come down to the 
courtyard after seeing Touga walking up to Juri.

&quot;Lets take a walk.&quot;

Juri gazed at Utena and then nodded.

&quot;What is Touga up to now? I heard him talking about...&quot;

Juri frowned and said, &quot;Never mind that. I dealt with him.&quot;

The pair walked around Ohtori until they reached some cabin Utena had 
never seen before.

&quot;Umm, I will be late for class.&quot; Utena tried to turn and head back 
toward the main building as she heard the bells sound to end first 
lunch.

Juri caught her hand &quot;No it&#39;s okay I will excuse you for the day. I 
want you to see this.&quot;

Utena looked at her skeptically &quot;As long as it can be excused.&quot;

Juri took her key and opened the cabin door; she led Utena inside of 
the two-room construction.

&quot;Wow, it is nice in here.&quot; Utena said as she admired the giant rose 
pattern on the ceiling of the cabin.

&quot;It is, I found this place four years ago and never stopped coming 
here. Only two other people know where this is, it was abandoned when 
I found it.&quot;

Juri gestured towards the couch in the living area and the two girls 
sat. In the small living room there was a fireplace and a desk in the 
corner, the next room had a bed and small chest for clothes.

&quot;So who are the others who know where this cabin is?&quot; Utena questioned 
innocently, unknowing to the pain it would cause the other girl.

Juri looked down at her locket and gave a mirthless laugh, &quot;Just 
Shihori and Ruka.&quot;

Utena felt sorry she asked the question Juri had went from friendly to 
looking like heart-breaking sadness. The pink haired girl could see 
tears forming in the girls&#146; eyes; Juri suddenly stood and ripped the 
locket from around her neck. Utena wanted to say or do something to 
help her new friend ,but had no idea of what was going on. Juri opened 
the locket to look at a picture of her with Ruka and Shihori. The 
tears splashed down on to the picture leaving streaks on the small 
glass.

&quot;Juri?&quot; Utena said walking over to the girl and embracing her &quot;Wanna 
talk about it?&quot;

Juri let Utena pull her down on the couch and laid on top of the 
smaller girl, taking comfort in the embrace and the safe feeling it 
gave her. &gt;Just like my dream.&lt;

&quot;I have never. I&#146;m sorry it&#39;s just you-&quot;

Utena ran her hands through Juri&#146;s hair &quot;It&#39;s okay you don&#39;t have to.&quot;

&quot;No, I want to so, it will be over.&quot;

Utena nodded pretending to understand. Juri handed the locket to Utena 
and began to explain...

&quot;That was Shihori, Ruka, and I three years ago; we were the best of 
friends, always inseparable. We did everything together, even learning 
to fence. But, I was young I didn&#39;t understand that depending on your 
friends could be so dangerous, if they are everything to you it would 
hurt more if they betrayed you. I never thought anything of it Shihori 
and I had been friends since childhood and somewhere down the line I 
had fallen deeply in love with her.&quot;

Utenas&#39; eyebrows did their best to crawl off her forehead.

&quot;I would do anything for my best friends....&quot; Juri paused and breathed 
in deeply, &quot;Until one day I came in to the fencing room to put up some 
equipment and saw them, together. Ruka knew I was in love with her, in 
fact I had told him too many times to count.&quot;

Juri wanted to sink into Utena.

&quot;They knew I was there, but they didn&#39;t stop in fact they went at it 
harder. Later on Shihori told me that they had set it up, it killed me 
and made my belief in angels and miracles disappear. I thought she was 
my angel, my miracle gift sent from Kami...but she wasn&#39;t.&quot;

Utena was so angry she wanted to go find Shihori and beat her 
senseless for hurting poor Juri.

&quot;And the worst part is I let her..&quot; Juri trailed off, losing her will 
to speak.

&quot;Let her what?&quot; Asked Utena

&quot;I-I I still let her string me on and hurt me, but I just couldn&#39;t 
stop loving her. That is why I seem so cold, I just don&#39;t want it to 
happen again.&quot;

Utena held her even tighter &gt;That unbelievable bitch! How dare she! 
Juri is so... Why would anyone purposely hurt a great girl like her?!&lt;

Utena didn&#39;t want to ask, but had to.

&quot;Why me?&quot;

Juri lifted her head to look at Utena,&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Why are you trusting me and telling me this. Before today I thought 
you hated Himamiya and I.&quot;

Juri sighed &quot;I&#39;m sorry it wasn&#39;t you or Anthy it&#39;s just that you and 
Anthy both have a purpose. A reason to fight, I on the other hand am 
just empty, their is no chick to breath the worlds shell.&quot;

Utena couldn&#39;t believe how much pain Juri had endured at the hands of 
Shihori. &gt;I will have to talk with Shihori later.&lt;

Juri cried for sometime and Utena stroked her hair, whispering 
reassuring words.

&quot;And you. Because...&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s silly really.&quot; Juri said whipping away her tears.

&quot;I won&#39;t laugh,&#148; promised Utena.

&quot;Well, I had my first...ugh dream where I uggghhh...was with someone. 
And I always thought it&#39;d be Shihori, but it was you.&quot;

Utena had a sudden nosebleed, as her eyes grew wide.

&quot;Oh..&quot;

Juri put her head back on Utenas&#39; shoulder and blushed, &quot;And in my 
whole life I have never even been kissed, so thinking of us doing that 
together was a lot for me to-&quot;

Utena played with Juri&#146;s pointy ear, &#147;I understand. So you&#39;ve never 
been kissed?&quot;

Juri shook her head no.

Utena smiled, &quot;Up.&quot;

Juri didn&#39;t want to move, but respected Utena&#146;s wishes and stood. 
Utena also stood; she reached her hand out and bowed in front of Juri.

&quot;Would you do me the pleasure of giving me this dance?&quot;

Juri giggled and her gloomy face brightened and she spoke in a small 
country voice, &quot;Why, I do believe you are trying to charm me Prince 
Tenjou.&quot;

Utena couldn&#146;t help, but to giggle also &quot;Then I believe you are 
correct.&#148; said Utena and gave Juri a wink.

Juri took Utena&#146;s hand and the pair began to waltz to a tune Utena was 
humming, it wasn&#39;t the prettiest dance Juri had ever done, but it was 
the most special. Utena guided her around the small living area, 
dipping and twirling her; never losing her tune. Juri was laughing and 
smiling like she was once again the girl of the past; the only signs 
of her former discontent were her slightly red and puffy eyes. Utena 
enjoyed the sound of a real laugh from Juri; it wasn&#146;t half hearted 
like the others before. It was like something she lost came back to 
her.

&gt;I&#39;m glad I was the one to give it to her.&lt; thought the eighth grader.

Finally, Utena slowed the tune down and the pair stood together slowly 
rocking to the slow ending of the tune. Utena quit the rocking motions 
and they stood together un-moving. The taller girl still had her head 
rested on Utena&#146;s shoulder; Utena brought her hand to Juri&#146;s chin and 
raised her head up. Both girls breathing were once again heavy.

&gt;I hope...&lt;

Utena rose up and Juri leaned down, the pairs lips met half way in a 
gentle, chastise kiss. Utena moved away first and smiled at Juri,&quot;Now 
you have been kissed.&quot;

Juri was blushing furiously. &gt;That was perfect.&lt; ,she thought.

The two girls were still in an embrace while looking in each other&#146;s 
eyes...searching. Then Juri quickly leaned down and caught Utena&#146;s 
mouth opening it and sliding her tongue in to the warm cavern. Utena 
was shocked, but couldn&#39;t fight it...she didn&#39;t want to. Juri was a 
quick study; she was moving her tongue around the younger girls.

&gt;So warm&lt; Juri thought as her tongue played with Utena&#146;s.

Utena loved the texture of Juri so soft, like silk, Juri even tasted 
like peaches. Juri loved how Utenas&#39; mouth was soft, yet firm and the 
taste of fresh strawberry.

Juri didn&#39;t want to separate, but had to or she&#39;d pass out from too 
little oxygen. After they separated they both stood, panting and 
wondering what was happening to their relationship. They had only 
really known each other for one day and had already been nude together 
and French kissing.

&gt;Are we together?&lt; it was the question on both their minds ,but 
neither dared ask...afraid of both possible answers.

The two girls sat on opposite ends of the couch, to be sure something 
like that didn&#39;t happen again, trying to find words.

Juri spoke first, &quot;Are you in love with Anthy?&quot;

Utena looked far off in to the corner thinking of what to say. After 
some moments she spoke,&quot; I can&#39;t answer that question completely yet. 
I mean I do have feelings for Anthy a need to protect her because no 
one else will, but I wonder is that just all it is. She is my friend 
and I love her for that, but am I in love with her...no, I am in love 
with the Anthy she could be. The free, happy, smiling, silly, girl 
that isn&#39;t the Rose Bride. It is possible for me to love her if this 
were all over.&quot;

Juri nodded, &quot;So your not in love with her, but are waiting to see if 
you could be.&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s weird.&quot;

&quot;Nothing is weird at Ohtori.&quot; Commented Juri.

Utena smiled, happy that Juri understood her. That was something she 
rarely got from anyone, not even Anthy understood her. She just kind 
of went along with whatever Utena said or wanted.

Juri stood up, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but all this emotional out pouring has made 
me tired...it&#39;s not something I do often.&quot;

Utena smiled,&#148; Sweet dreams, I&#39;ll be here on the couch if you need 
anything.&quot;

Juri went to the other room and took off her white student council 
uniform and neatly folded it. Utena looked over her shoulder and 
asked,&#148; Why are you doing that?&#148; She could see Juri since there was no 
door closing the room off.

Juri called back, &#147;So they won&#146;t get wrinkled.&#148;

Utena slapped her forehead and flopped back on the soft couch 
cushions, &#147;Oh.&#148;

Juri lied down on the bed and tried to sleep, but she couldn&#146;t let her 
mind rest. She couldn&#146;t stop thinking about the events from past years 
&gt;How could they?&#133;&lt; Juri turned again and started to cry. Juri shifted 
her head around the pillow for the twentieth time and began to let out 
all of her pent up anguish from the past. Utena who was still laying 
on the couch couldn&#146;t ignore the older girls sobs any longer ,got up 
and leaned on the entrance way to the bedroom.

&#147;Is everything okay?&#148; ,asked the blue eyed eighth grader ;though she 
already knew the answer.

Juri just sat and silently and sobbed unready to ask for the comfort 
she knew Utena was so ready to give, she couldn&#146;t find it in herself 
to ask. &gt;Hold me Utena.&lt;

Utena didn&#146;t know what to do &gt;I want to help her through this.&lt; The 
rose champion stripped of her uniform and got in the bed, spooning the 
taller girl. There were no words, in truth there was nothing more to 
say, Utena silently comforted a heartbroken Juri until they both fell 
asleep.

~~~

Shihori grabbed her boyfriend of the weeks hand and dragged him away 
from the basketball court.

&#147;I brought the camera.&#148; ,she said with a wicked grin.

Tsuyoshi smiled and held his girlfriends hand as they walk off to some 
secret spot of hers, guaranteed to be private. They had gone out 
together for three days and he hadn&#146;t scored yet, unlike his best 
friend Koichi who had been with her for two days before he had gotten 
some. But, Tsuyoshi was one step above everyone he was going to get a 
private show and pictures! &gt;I can&#146;t wait to show all the boys in the 
judo club&lt; All the time they were walking Shihori was rambling on 
about something or the other ,but Tsuyoshi didn&#146;t care his thoughts 
were on something else, all he did was utter an answer here and there 
to make her happy.

&gt;Oh man!!!!! I will be all the guys envy.&lt;

After walking down a small hill Shihori announced &#147;We&#146;re here.&#148;

Tsuyoshi was practically rubbing his hands together in glee, he was so 
close to scoring!

&#147;I don&#146;t have the key anymore so we will have to climb through the 
window.&#148;

Tsuyoshi started walking to the window, &#147;Okay.&#148;

Shihori lifted the unlocked window and slid inside soon followed by 
Tsuyoshi. The couple were heading to the bedroom when Shihori noticed 
the two girls sleeping on the bed.

Anthy sat on the edge of the huge metal framed bench in the rose 
garden swinging her legs and talking to her little companion Chu-Chu.

&#147;Yes, Chu-Chu your right the red roses are prettier this year.&#148;

The little creature jumped in the palm of her hand and squeaked.

&#147;Your right Utena was supposed to come by for tea.&#148;

Chu-Chu&#146;s eyes turned to little black dots as a frown appeared on his 
face and the little creature silently begged.

Anthy pushed her glasses up to her nose and she agreed &#147;Yes, Chu-Chu 
we can have our tea now.&#148;

Anthy took the thermos out of her school bag and grabbed two rose 
shaped cups ,so she could serve the tea to Chu-Chu and herself when 
someone entered the garden. Wakaba had never been inside the garden 
where Anthy spent all her time. In fact she thought it was really 
weird ,but she had to talk to the strange dark skinned girl to find 
out where her darling Utena had been hiding all day. &gt;I hope she isn&#146;t 
going to act weird&lt; Wakaba stood by as Anthy didn&#146;t even seem to take 
notice of her and served tea to the little monkey-whatever.

&#147;Ugh, hi Anthy I was wondering have you seen Utena?&#148; stated Wakaba in 
a nervous voice.

Anthy looked down at Chu-Chu and spoke with a very serious voice, 
&#147;Aren&#146;t you going to greet our guest?&#148;

The little animal immediately jumped up and bowed to Wakaba squeaking 
out &#147;Chu-Chu Chu.&#148;

Anthy smiled at her best friend while patting his head, &#148;Chu-Chu.&#148;

Wakaba watched the display and suddenly felt guilty that she hadn&#146;t 
taken the time to get to know Anthy, the girl obviously had no other 
friends.

&#147;So have you umm&#133;&#148;

Anthy tilted her head and spoke, &#147;Utena? No, I haven&#146;t seen her since 
this morning. I&#146;m afraid she will have to miss out on our tea.&#148;

Wakaba looked around for a second, &#147;Do you mind if I shared you tea 
with you then?&#148;

For a brief moment Anthy&#146;s green eyes were wide and surprise splayed 
across her face; no one ever wanted to talk to her.

The small girl handed Wakaba a cup, &#147;Of course, just as long as 
Chu-Chu agrees.&#148;

The little animal squeaked approval and the three sat on the bench to 
drink their tea.

They sat in silence for some moments the normally over-talkative Greek 
girl couldn&#146;t find anything to say. &gt;Come on Wakaba! Utena can talk to 
her so can you!&lt;

Wakaba jumped up into a victory pose, Anthy covered her mouth and 
unsuccessfully tried to stop her oncoming giggling fit. A huge sweat 
drop appeared on Wakaba&#146;s face and she fell back on to the bench. 
Anthy was now laughing so hard she was beet red and holding her sides.

&#147;Aww, come on! It wasn&#146;t that funny.&#148; Wakaba said feigning 
embarrassment.

Chu-Chu used the opportunity to run away with a butter cookie he had 
stolen from the plate Anthy laid out for Wakaba.

While Anthy was pulling herself together Wakaba took the opportunity 
to chase the little critter around.

&#147;Waaaaaaahhhhh! Gimme back my cookie. Anthy set it out for me you 
little kaijuu!&#148;

Anthy watch the wild antics of the pair and laughed even harder &gt;I 
wonder if this is what it&#146;s like to have a friend.&lt; the thought made 
Anthy grow quiet. Wakaba dropped the creature she had scooped up and 
put it on the bench as she sat.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong Anthy? You look sad&#133;.you always look sad.&#148; ,said the 
tanned Onion Princess.

Anthy once again gave an empty smile and held her feeling to herself 
,&#148;I am happy as long as my suitor is happy.&#148;

Wakaba wasn&#146;t convinced ,but knew it wasn&#146;t her place to push the 
other girl &gt;I will figure you out Himamiya Anthy. It&#146;s my duty as 
Utena&#146;s best friend.&lt;

***

 

Juri and Utena woke up and put on their clothes.

&#147;Thank you, Utena I-&#148;

Utena went over to Juri and put her finger over the taller girls lips 
to silence her. &#147;You don&#146;t need words for some things.&#148;

Juri couldn&#146;t help herself, she found it all too easy to pull Utena 
into another kiss. Utena surrendered to the sweet feeling and returned 
Juri&#146;s kiss more passionately. Juri let her hand roam over the eighth 
graders body stopping at the firm breast and caressing them. She 
pulled back to look in Utena&#146;s eyes and found no sign of disapproval, 
Juri smiled and continued the kiss reviling in the strawberry taste, 
the taste she knew she couldn&#146;t go without anymore. Utena started to 
unbutton the top of Juri&#146;s uniform as Juri did the same to hers. Utena 
pushed Juri back down on to the bed. The pink haired eighth grade was 
now sitting on Juri&#146;s midsection and becoming painfully aware of how 
good this felt.

&#147;Is something wrong?&#148; ,Juri said looking up at Utena whose eyes were 
wide.

&#147;No.&#148; Utena answered breathlessly, &#147;I want- I--&#148;

Utena undid the bra Juri was wearing and threw it aside, Juri pulled 
Utena down and resumed the kiss this time letting all the emotions she 
wanted to express come through. The orange haired girl caressed Utenas 
back and unsnapped her bra and threw it to the side. The result was 
electric, throwing the two already hormonal teenagers into over-drive. 
The two girls hardened nipples rubbed against each other increasing 
the moisture between their legs. Juri had never been so close to 
another person and it was wonderful, she was so happy to share this 
with Utena.

&#147;Oh god, you feel so great.&#148; moaned Juri.

Utena kissed a trail down the long neck and found her way to Juri&#146;s 
nipples &gt;I have been waiting for this&lt;, Utena thought wickedly. Utena 
put her warm mouth on the plump pink nipple and Juri arched upwards 
into her.

&#147;Oh!&#148; ,cried out Juri she was convinced that the moist heat from 
Utena&#146;s mouth was the greatest thing she had ever felt in her life. 
Utena sucked and tugged at the hardened right nipple while rolling the 
other between two of her fingers. Utena could tell Juri was loving it 
as much as she was, the other girl kept arching up with every pinch or 
hard suck on her rock hard nipple.

Utena pulled away for a moment and breathlessly said, &#147;I like that.&#148;

Understanding Juri started to push upward with her midsection causing 
a rocking motion between her and Utena. Taking some initiative Juri 
reached for the young athletes neglected nipples and pinched and 
rolled them with her fingers. Utena felt electricity flow from the 
spot Juri was touching to her midsection, causing her to suck harder 
on Juri. The rocking motion increased and both girls were ready for 
more, their insides were liquefying waiting for the special touch of a 
lover.

Juri flipped Utena over and mounted her taking the same position as 
Utena was in a moment ago. Juri reached down an kneaded the pert 
breast and teased the nipples. Utena&#146;s face was red from arousal, she 
wanted this so bad her insides were tingling.

&#147;Juri I want to.&#148;

Juri blushed &#147;I-I want it too, but I don&#146;t know how&#133;&#148;

Utena leaned up and kissed Juri pulling her down into a laying 
position on top of her.

&#147;Neither do I&#148;, admitted the younger girl after they had stopped 
kissing.

Utena moved her hands down Juri&#146;s pants and-

&gt;I can&#146;t&lt;, the thought hit Utena like lightning bolt.

Juri felt Utena&#146;s had fall to the bed and wonder what happened.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry I&#146;m not good at this ,did I do something wr-&#148;

&#147;No it&#146;s my fault Juri forgive me I can&#146;t. It&#146;s Anthy. I just realized 
I couldn&#146;t. Oh god forgive I&#146;m-&#148;

Juri got off of Utena and the bed, &#147;No don&#146;t be it was my fault. I 
know you are waiting for Anthy and I just took advantage of your 
kindness.&#148;

&#147;Juri it&#146;s not like that at all. You didn&#146;t make me do anything I 
didn&#146;t want to do. I&#146;m confused just give me some time to think.&#148;

The two girls got dressed again for the fourth time that day and 
finally headed back to Ohtori, thinking their own separate thoughts 
about the other.

 

***

Shihori&#39;s evil mind was working double time as she spread the 
Utena/Juri rumor through the school accompanied with picture that all 
the boys just love.

Groups of student stood together whispering in the halls as Anthy and 
Wakaba entered.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; ,asked the Greek girl, she was never on to resist 
the latest bit of gossip.

Anthy didn&#39;t really care ,but she didn&#39;t want to risk making her new 
friend think ill of her. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Wakaba why don&#39;t you ask one 
of the other students?&quot;

Wakaba grabbed Anthy and dragged her through the throng of the crowd 
until they reached Nanami standing with her usual group.

&quot;Nonami what is going on? I haven&#39;t seen this many people standing 
around since they found Akio.&quot;

The blonde haired girl looked at Wakaba in disgust, &quot;What are you 
doing with that freak?&quot;

Anthy blushed and started to turn away. &gt;I want to go&lt;

Wakaba picked up on Anthys discomfort and turned to leave &gt;I&#39;ll talk 
to Nonami later. &lt; The girl thought grimly.

As they again passed through the crowd Wakaba saw another familiar 
face

&gt;She has lots of friends&lt;, thought the hermit-like Anthy.

&quot;Miki-kun!&quot;

&#147;Oh, hello Wakaba, is what they are saying about Juri and Utena true?&#148;

&#147;Anno&#133;I don&#146;t know what your talking about.&#148;, said the Onion girl.

Anthy looked at Miki and wondered how could Utena be causing such 
uproar again.

Miki looked and Anthy and then put his head down ,in a quiet voice he 
said, &#147;They say Arisugawa-sempai and Utena are&#133; sleeping together. 
Shihori passed around the pictures those kids are looking at.&#148;

Anthy walked over and took the picture handed to her by a girl. She 
handed it to Wakaba and the three looked at it.

&#147;AAhhhhhhhh!!!!!!&#148;, scream the tanned onion girl.

Anthy&#146;s eyes grew wide and she turned to run away&#133;

***

Student Council President Touga Kiryuu laid on his bed wearing nothing 
more than his smug smile, today was one of the easiest perceived 
victories he had ever had.

&gt;At the rate things are going Arisugawa will destroy her image and 
bring down that insipid child with her&#133;and The Rose Bride will be all 
mine.&lt; Touga leaned his head back and gave a mirthless laugh.

&gt;I really should send that Taketsuki a thank you letter.&lt;
