<h1>Kakumei no Bara (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tanuki.html">Tanuki</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../utena/kakubara-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Anthy crouched behind the couch, waiting anxiously. She watched as 
Utena stumbled into the room, the blindfold she had on only made it 
that much harder.

&quot;Okay, when I said I could find you with my eyes closed, I didn&#39;t think 
that you&#39;d actually take me seriously.&quot;

Anthy didn&#39;t say anything, she just giggled from where she crouched. 
Utena stumbled around, feeling the walls for a soft protrusion.

&quot;C&#39;mon I know you&#39;re in here.&quot; Utena was getting frustrated. She had 
been trying to find Anthy for an hour, she had a vague feeling that she 
was in the room, a sense that she hadn&#39;t realized she had until Anthy 
returned to her. It was a sense just between Anthy and herself. Then 
she caught a whiff of roses and everything clicked.

Anthy couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing. She had been watching Utena 
stumble about; an adorable site if you ever asked her, when Utena 
merely stopped and turned right at her. Anthy&#39;s eyes bugged out and she 
made to get out from behind the couch. Unfortunately, Utena was waiting 
there for her; staring at her from behind the blindfold.

Her speed is definitely increasing.

&quot;Told you I could do it.&quot; Utena giggled from where she crouched. She 
pulled the blindfold off and addressed her bride.

&quot;I knew you could do it, ouji-sama.&quot; Anthy purred from her position. 
Instead of moving forward, she began leaning backwards, her eye 
offering things that were really not meant to be done behind a couch.

Like Utena really cared where it was done.

They were almost down to their undergarments; if Anthy were wearing 
any, when the door opened. Utena panicked and looked up. There was only 
one other person who had a key to their apartment.

Tenjou Yurika was tired. She had been up for hours on the plane ride 
home. Sakura wasn&#39;t even fully conscious. All she wanted to do was 
crawl into bed and not wake up until she was damn ready to. She trudged 
into the apartment to see something she had not expected to. It was her 
niece; her innocent little Utena-chan, in a rather compromising 
position with another girl. An attractive young girl, but a girl 
nonetheless.

&quot;Hey Auntie.&quot;

Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Kakumei no Bara

Running Interference; My Aunt Yurika

Utena sat at the table, a cup of tea in her hand. She kept wringing her 
hands around it, trying to let the heat ease her nervousness. For all 
her hand wringing, she might as well have been stretching. Yurika sat 
at the other end of the table, wringing her hands around her teacup. 
Anthy watched from the doorway, seeing just how much the aunt resembled 
her husband. She wistfully sipped her rose tea and watched some more.

&quot;Auntie.&quot;

&quot;Yes Utena.&quot;

&quot;Um, sorry you had to walk in on that last night.&quot;

&quot;So am I actually.&quot;

They stayed like that for long moments, just kind of staring and 
drinking. Yurika looked into her drink, hoping to figure out what to 
say in it.

&quot;So, do you love her?&quot;

&quot;What.&quot;

&quot;Do you love her? It&#39;s kind of a simple question. She&#39;s obviously been 
staying here a while. She redecorated the bathroom.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

They each sat there, in the old student council room. They sat apart 
from each other, sparing glances at the envelopes every now and again. 
No one had said anything for the past few minutes. The last sound had 
been Miki coughing, resulting in a sharp turn of heads in his 
direction. That had been five minutes ago and they returned to their 
stupor. Finally when they thought the silence would strangle them, a 
saint intervened.

&quot;Um, hello; is anyone in here? I heard that people who got gold 
envelopes would be meeting here.&quot; Wakaba wandered into the room looking 
around. Her eyes snagged on Sayonji. &quot;Sayonji-sama!&quot; she squeaked out 
before flinging herself at him. For his part, he let out a rather goofy 
grin before returning to his usual self and glaring at the other 
duelists, daring them to say anything. Nanami, Juri and Miki didn&#39;t 
need to say anything; they just sat there and giggled at him; which 
only provoked the man further towards violence. Finally Wakaba stepped 
away.

&quot;So, um what&#39;s going on here? I though the duels were over.&quot; Wakaba 
received several shocked stares. Miki&#39;s eyes were huge.

&quot;Y-you remember?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I was a duelist too for a while there.&quot; Wakaba answered 
matter-of-factly. She lifted her hand to show her new ring. I know I 
wasn&#39;t much of a fighter, but Sayonji-sama&#39;s been teaching me kendo.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll bet he has,&quot; was all Juri could mutter from her corner. Miki, 
being the only one within hearing distance burst into giggles.

&quot;Anyway!&quot; Nanami burst from her corner; we&#39;re not here to discuss what 
she knows and doesn&#39;t know. She obviously has a ring. A very odd 
looking ring, but a ring none the less. That means she qualifies to be 
a part of this meeting. The point of which was to figure out who sent 
these letters, since Sekai no Hate didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Wakaba asked

&quot;Sekai no Hate; he was the last person to officiate over the duels. 
He&#39;s better known here as Akio-san.&quot; It was Juri who stated it bluntly 
at Wakaba.

&quot;Ohtori-sama was the head of the duels?&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;Why.&quot;

&quot;That, you shall find out in time. As for the question of who sent that 
letters, I can answer that right now. I did.&quot;

The woman they turned to see was no one they knew. She slightly 
resembled Anthy and the Chairman; with dark skin and an odd beauty 
about her. However; she has straight hair, tied in a bun with it 
colored an odd shade of purplish white. Miki and Nanami seemed to be 
the only ones affected. Sayonji was the first to speak

&quot;How, we were not successful in retrieving the power of revolutions. Oh 
yes, and who are you?&quot;

&quot;For now, you may refer to me as Kami. As for how you can help, it&#39;s 
rather simple; you survived. Everything else will be revealed in time. 
Now listen carefully; I&#39;m not a person to repeat myself&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The next day Yurika, Utena, Anthy and Sakura were shopping for some 
things to decorate Utena &amp; Anthy&#39;s room with. Or at least it had 
started out that way. As the bags slowly increased in number, they 
began to realize that it was actually a chance for Yurika to give her 
credit cards some exercise. 

&quot;I know I shouldn&#39;t but there are just so many cute outfits out there.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s complaining Auntie?&quot; It was Utena who piped up, holding her 
begs. Several new outfits waited for her to play with. She needed some 
outfits to fit her new role. If she was indeed the prince she wanted to 
look the part. Even Anthy smiled at her own bags. It had been a while 
that she received new clothes without any strings attached. Sakura 
walked slowly next to Anthy, staring at her the whole time. Since she 
had come home, she hadn&#39;t said a word to the dark princess. Anthy 
resolved herself to change that and try talking to the child as soon as 
they got home.

As they were passing a coffee shop, and stopped dead in her tracks. The 
others noted her absence a few minutes later. Utena backtracked to her 
&quot;wife.&quot;

&quot;Hime, what&#39;s up? Are you okay?&quot; Utena&#39;s face crept with concern before 
a smile started growing on Anthy&#39;s face until she looked downright 
elated.

&quot;Hold on Utena-otto, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;

Having said that Anthy disappeared into the coffee shop, leaving a very 
confused Utena there. A few moments later, Anthy reappeared holding a 
small bundle of fur. Utena recognized it immediately.

&quot;Chu-chu!&quot; Utena yelled happily. The tiny monkey mouse stopped munching 
on whatever it had this time to see Utena. Food long forgotten, it 
launched itself at her happily.

&quot;Anthy where was he? How come I haven&#39;t seen him for so long...Why 
didn&#39;t I remember him either for that matter? I completely forgot about 
him. Ara! I&#39;m so sorry Chu-chu.&quot; Chu-chu merely waved her off, pointing 
to a rather amused Anthy. She had enjoyed watching them play. It filled 
her with warmth that she hadn&#39;t felt in a long time.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Utena-otto, he wanted you to forget about him; at least 
for a little while. I had him take care of a few things &#39;elsewhere,&#39; so 
I figured I&#39;d erase your memory of him for a while. It seemed like a 
good idea at the time. I didn&#39;t want you worrying about him.&quot;

&quot;How can I not, look at him, he&#39;s so small, and how can he take care of 
himself?&quot;

Anthy merely smirked at her. She looked own and snapped her fingers. 
Opening her hand she held still and waited. Chu-chu instantly jumped 
out of Utena&#39;s hand. In the air she noted how he changed from an odd 
monkey mouse creature into something else. Utena couldn&#39;t place it; she 
had never seen anything else like it before. It landed on her palm 
confidently. A small mass of black, with odd luminescent eyes. Then 
Anthy opened her eyes to show a similar luminescence. It frightened 
her.

&quot;This is what Chu-chu really looks like. Do you understand why I have 
total confidence in his ability to take care of himself now?&quot; Utena 
nodded dumbly. On that note Anthy turned back to her normal self, 
giving Utena her enigmatic smile, she started scratching the creature 
under its &quot;chin&quot; and giggling. &quot;It&#39;s cute, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Yurika and Sakura came running up that moment to see what was taking 
Utena so long. By now Chu-chu was back to &quot;normal&quot; and munching noisily 
on a cookie.

&quot;Utena, what&#39;s taking you so long to find Anthy? Oh there you two 
are... What the hell is that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my friend Chu-chu. Cute isn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;Very, in a disturbing kind of way.&quot;

Anthy merely stared at Yurika flatly. Thinking up obscenities not heard 
in the human language in many a century. Before any of them had a 
chance to really say anything else, Yurika was zipping towards another 
store. She had seen the cutest pants suit and wanted it bad.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By the time Juri got to her room, she was tired, sore and baffled at 
how she was going to pack for the trip ahead. The voices in the back of 
her mind were nagging her again about her lack of cleaning ability. She 
was so exhausted she almost missed seeing her mystery girl sitting in 
front of her room, back against the door. Apparently, she had fallen 
asleep waiting. A smile quirked Juri&#146;s face and she nudged the girl 
with her foot.

Juri moved to get her key out from underneath the doormat, but quickly 
realized that said key sat under the girl&#146;s rear. She gulped for a 
second and steeling her arguments to defend her virtue, Juri reached 
under anyway. The apparently sleeping girls hand gripped her arm, 
stopping her. She watched the girl&#146;s pierced eyebrow quirk up and a 
hand reached into the other girl&#146;s cleavage, luckily it wasn&#146;t one of 
her own. Juri&#146;s room key came from the small valley and her eyes opened 
at last, watching the fencer.

&#147;You should clean your room more often. I didn&#146;t even want to wait in 
there.&#148;

Juri gave her a whithering look and proceeded to stand. Unlocking the 
door and opening it in one swift motion, Juri sent her mysterious guest 
tumbling into her room. What Juri saw next would haunt her to the end 
of her days. Her room was clean, sparkling even. Her eyes dilated at 
the sight of such cleanliness emanating from her room. She turned back 
to the girl with a stunned look on her face.

&#147;I didn&#146;t want to wait in there, so I figured I clean up and then wait 
for you outside.&#148;

Juri turned back to view her room. There were not words to describe how 
she felt at that moment. Turning back to her still unnamed companion, 
she asked her the two things she had been dying to know since she met 
her. &#147;How&#133;.Why?&#148; 

&#147;I did it because it is my duty form now on. As for who I am, my name 
is Sakaya; I&#146;m your Rose Bride.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Inside the store, they each gathered around the counter as Yurika made 
her purchase. As she pulled out another credit card, a small picture 
fell out of her wallet. Before she could even register it, Utena had 
already zipped down to pick it up. Before she gave it back, she took a 
look...

...and nearly hit the floor...

...There in the picture were her parents, looking like normal 
teenagers. Normal teenagers except for the fact that they were both 
wearing the Ohtori Academy&#39;s duelist&#39;s uniforms.

Anthy saw Utena&#39;s reaction and moved to catch her. She took the picture 
from Utena and looked at it. Upon seeing it, her face hardened and she 
turned to Yurika.

&quot;Yurika-san-&quot;

&quot;Call me Auntie.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Auntie; we have to go home right now.&quot;

&quot;Why is that dear, I&#39;m just getting warmed up.&quot; 

&quot;Take a look at your niece.&quot;

Yurika turned her head to address Utena only to see that the girl had 
withdrawn into herself. Her face was a glazed mask. She then saw the 
photo that had fallen out of Utena&#39;s hand. Looking at it, a revelation 
occurred.

&quot;Sigh; apparently, it&#39;s time for me to explain a few things about her 
parents to my dear niece.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

He sat there staring at the envelope in his hand. What did it matter to 
him if the damnable games had started again? He was out, and that was 
all that mattered. Sekai no Hate said that he didn&#39;t send those letters 
and that he didn&#39;t want the others to join. They had proven useless and 
weak; held back by the chains. Puppets tangled in their strings. Of 
course, Tenjou had untangled them, but according to the chairman, they 
could just as easily get tangled in new ones. However, it was no longer 
his concern, he had graduated. So why did he care, anyway?

&quot;Damn that girl and her infectious chivalry.&quot;

He stared at his bed companion. Aino-san was a beautiful woman; but he 
had known many beautiful women in his life. Yet, in the time he was 
with her, he was not with others. He didn&#39;t feel the need to play the 
playboy anymore.

&quot;I wonder if this is what they call contentedness. Maybe it is even 
love.&quot;

Touga chuckled at that last thought. He had thought that once before, 
and been denied. Maybe his own chains had been untangled. He didn&#39;t 
feel any different, but Sayonji had not noticed any changes when they 
happened to him.

&quot;Intriguing.&quot;

Touga just lay there for hours, looking at the ceiling. Akio had 
threatened him if he joined. He knew better than to take that threat 
lightly. However...

&quot;Damn that girl and her infectious chivalry.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Anthy closed the door as Utena and her aunt sat down for another cup of 
tea. They would be there for a while, she thought to herself. As she 
turned, her private revelry was ended as she came chest to face with 
Utena&#39;s cousin.

&quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;Hi&quot;

&quot;Came to check on your mom and cousin, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m worried about her. Aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m always worried about her, but I have confidence in her strength. 
It&#39;s one of the reasons why I love her.&quot;

&#147;You&#146;re strange.&#148;

&#147;Excuse me?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know what it is, but you&#146;re weird. You made Utena-oneesama 
weird too.&#148;

&#147;Oh&#133; is it because of what you saw us doing the other day.&#148;

&#147;No, my friend Mari has two mommies so its not that. Utena-oneesama 
doesn&#146;t look different or act different she just-&#147;

&#147;She feels different.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, that&#146;s it!&#148;

&#147;Well, there&#146;s a reason for that.&#148; Anthy said as she crouched down so 
she was face to face with the girl. &#147;Let me tell you a story.&#148;

&#147;A story?&#148;

&#147;You know how your cousin wants to be a prince.&#148;

&#147;Uhm hm.&#148;

&#147;Well, I&#146;m going to tell you how Utena became a prince and of the 
princess she saved.&#148;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

&quot;Okay Utena, what I&#39;m going to tell you may come as a shock.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised how much it&#39;d take to shock me these days.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm, maybe, considering who your girlfriend is.&quot;

&quot;You knew Anthy?&quot;

&quot;I went to Ohtori too, heard the rumors about the Chairman&#39;s weird 
sister. Of course, your father was the only one to talk to her at the 
time. He would come home with these weird stories about secret duels 
and this power to bring revolution to something or other.&quot;

&quot;Bring revolution to the world. The duels were to bring revolution. Did 
he ever talk about an arena in the sky?&quot;

&quot;Um, no. He always said they were in the basements. Although he did say 
that his sempai was working on some weird sky arena.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yup, some weird guy with this flaming pink hair. A real freak.&quot;

Utena just glared at her.

&quot;No, not the hair. I meant he was weird. They said he wasn&#39;t human, 
like he was a computer or something.&quot;

&quot;Weird.&quot;

&quot;Yeah; anyway, he knew about a lot of stuff, he even got to meet the 
chairman.&quot;

Utena paled as she heard that.

&quot;He&#39;s the one who introduced your parents. They were so happy together. 
Your father said that for that he would save Anthy. Though, from what 
he never said.&quot;

Utena stared at the photo in her hands. Her father and mother stared 
into it, smiling happily. In the background, she could see Anthy 
smiling behind her mother.

&quot;Did Anthy ever go home with dad?&quot;

&quot;Once, he had her stay in my room with me. We didn&#39;t say much.&quot;

Utena let out a sigh of relief. Her father had never done anything with 
Anthy; though she wondered if Anthy wouldn&#39;t have said anything if she 
knew. She decided to put faith in her wife. She got up.

&quot;Is there anything else?&quot;

&quot;... I think so.&quot;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

They stood in the basement; knee deep in junk that their neighbors 
could not throw out. Yurika scrounged around their family&#39;s corner. 
Anthy and Utena stood hand in hand together, just watching Utena&#39;s aunt 
act strange.

&quot;Got it!&quot; She yelled as she unsettled a rather large pile. &quot;Your father 
said that if you ever said anything about the duels to give you this.&quot; 
She handed Utena a wrapped package. Utena recognized its shape and 
started tearing away the packaging.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe my dad actually left me a sword, a real life family 
heirloom...&quot;

&quot;Bokken.&quot; Anthy finished dully staring at the rather odd looking 
practice sword. Utena&#39;s face dropped as she looked at it. She couldn&#39;t 
use this. She used a real sword; well it was a real sword before it was 
shattered. She sighed and looked pleadingly at her aunt.

&quot;Please tell me this is a joke.&quot;

&quot;No joke. Your dad gave that to me to give to you.&quot;

&quot;Auntie.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry; he said that it had a few surprises in it. Just use it in 
one duel.&quot;

Utena just sighed. &quot;If it&#39;s what my father wanted.&quot; She said as she 
sheathed the sword in her belt. Anthy patted her on the shoulder and 
smiled at her. Utena just sighed and walked away. She had things she 
needed to think about.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It was a calm summer day at Ohtori academy. A bus pulled in front of 
the student council building and just sat idling. It was an hour later 
when Sayonji showed up in front of it. He was soon joined by Juri, 
Sakaya, Miki, Wakaba and Nanami.

&quot;Did one of you guys hire this bus?&quot; Sayonji asked from his vantage 
point.

&quot;Um, no.&quot; Wakaba was the first to answer.

&quot;Well, someone had to.&quot; Juri, ever the pragmatist retorted from her 
area. Next to her, Sakaya just nodded her agreement. Miki just gave the 
new girl a sideward glance. Juri still had yet to explain to him what 
she was doing there. Juri didn&#39;t seem the type to drag her girlfriend 
into this world.

&quot;I sent for it, if you must know. One Kiryuu Touga answered as he 
stepped into view from inside the bus. He was wearing a black variant 
of his duelist uniform. He just stood there, smiling at them. A strange 
woman stood next to him. He lifted his hand to show his signet ring.

&quot;Now if you really want to help Tenjou I would suggest climbing on the 
bus. I trust you are all packed.&quot; He looked at the bags that the others 
had. Everyone except Miki was hauling luggage about. They were not even 
dressed in their uniforms. &quot;Now, are you coming?&quot;

Miki just looked up at the others and sighed sadly. &#147;I&#146;m sorry you 
guys, but I&#146;ll have to meet you there in a few weeks. Kozue isn&#146;t ready 
to go yet and I don&#146;t want to leave her behind.&#148; Juri nodded in 
understanding and patted him on the back.

&#147;It&#146;s alright, well see you there.&#148;

Miki brightened under the encouragement. &#147;Thank you Juri-sempai, Please 
give Tenjou-kun my love.&#148; Juri gave him the proverbial hairy eyeball. 
&#147;You know what I mean.

The others made their way to the bus. Juri lingered at the bus for a 
minute.

&quot;So you&#39;re doing it, despite his best warnings not to.&quot;

&quot;What can I say? Tenjou&#39;s damn chivalry is contagious. I had to do 
something or risk feeling bad about it for the rest of my life. And 
feeling bad is something I&#39;ve never done; I don&#39;t want to start now.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything else you wanted to talk about Arisagawa?&quot;

&quot;No, not right now.&quot;

After a moment Juri waved to Miki one last time and got on the bus; 
Touga followed. A moment later, the bus pulled out of the parking lot 
and made its way to the island of Shirobara.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Utena sat on her terrace looking out on the city below. She had things 
to think about. She was so oblivious she never heard the door open. 

&quot;Can I join you?&quot; Anthy interrupted her thoughts. The dark princess 
waited expectantly for her answer.

&quot;Sure why not.&quot; Utena replied as she opened up her blanket to admit 
Anthy. The girl pressed her back against her groom&#39;s chest. Utena 
wrapped her arms around Anthy and presented her rose crest to Anthy. 
Conversations about the rose crest rarely ended well; so Anthy prepared 
herself to dodge the conversation.

&quot;Do you know that legally we&#39;ve been married for almost a month and yet 
we don&#39;t have rings?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have the money and you don&#39;t want me doing anything to get 
them myself. I believe your words were &#39;Hime; don&#39;t do nothing weird or 
illegal to get us some rings okay. I&#39;ll handle it&#39;.&quot;

Utena blushed remembering that day. &quot;Oh yeah; well I still hold to 
that.&quot;

&quot;Why are you bringing it up anyway?&quot;

Utena grasped Anthy&#39;s left hand and kissed it.

&quot;When we go back, people are going to be coming after you. They won&#39;t 
believe our word alone.&quot; She slipped her ring onto the captured hand. 
&#147;So I think you should have this.&#148;

Anthy stared at her now accessorized hand. In the entire time she was 
the bride, she never wore anything on that hand. Her brother forbade 
her from ever wearing anything on either hand. She was the rose bride 
and should never attach herself to someone because she could change 
hands very quickly. She was also never allowed a signet ring for fear 
that she could enter the dueling arena and win her own freedom. She 
stared at the slight trinket on her hand.

&quot;I figured it&#39;d have a better meaning that way. It led me to you; so it 
should go back where it belongs.... I have this feeling that I was 
always supposed to give it to you. I mean it really doesn&#39;t mean much, 
being that a lot of people have it, but it&#39;s all that I had and I 
wanted you to have it.&quot; Utena finished babbling with a whisper. She 
watched as Anthy turned around, tears sparkling the ends of her eyes. 
However, instead of the anger she was expecting; Anthy was smiling 
beautifully.

&quot;It means more to me than you could ever imagine. No band you could 
ever give me could mean this much. I love it; I love you.&quot; Anthy kissed 
her and laid her head on Utena&#39;s chest, listening to the quiet 
heartbeat. She felt Utena slip her arms around her and sigh.

She&#39;s happy.

She liked it

She loves me.

For herself, Tenjou Utena could not stop smiling. She was as happy as 
she had ever been in her life. What Akio had shown her was only a pale 
shadow compared to this. She had her princess and with that ring 
everyone would know. Everything else going on: The duels, her parent&#39;s 
history, the secret of her dad&#39;s lame bokken; those would all be 
settled in time. She had faith that with Anthy, everything would 
resolve itself. She sent a silent prayer to the heavens thanking them 
for whatever blessing they had bestowed upon her.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An odd young man sat in front of a computer screen. His face and hair 
were obscured by the computer glare as he stared at the data on the 
screen.

&quot;Interesting very interesting; the power of this &#39;Rose Bride&#39; is most 
phenomenal. I&#39;m most anticipating facing them to see what she can do. 
Oh well End of Life said that she would take care of that in time.&quot;

He sat back and sighed. He looked at the rings sitting on his desk. 
Each gem was a different color. A silver one; a black one; a dark green 
one, and a navy blue one sat waiting for his attention to their owners. 
Grasping the silver one he slipped it onto his hand. It matched his 
hair perfectly. He stood and fixed his uniform top. Silver and navy
