<a href="../utena/roadcap-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Utena took a clearly nervous Tsuwabuki aside, her expression grave. 
She sat the smaller man down and simply asked, &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;We got suckered,&quot; Tsuwabuki sighed tiredly. He pushed his short brown 
hair back from his face, &quot;We were out on patrol, when we first saw the 
bandit force. It was a small unit, and I thought we could take them.&quot;

&quot;So you left your position to go engage them,&quot; a carefully neutral 
Utena prompted him, and he nodded ruefully.

&quot;They tried to break away from fighting almost as soon as we met 
them,&quot; Tsuwabuki said, &quot;and I started to realize that something was 
wrong. I released the hawk, and turned to see the bandit forces 
combining. We went after them and managed to hit the group from behind 
just as they broke through to the caravan.&quot;

&quot;You got damn lucky,&quot; Utena murmured. She smiled down at him grimly, 
&quot;If they had been just a bit smarter, they would have stayed to wipe 
out your scouting force first, and then launched an attack on us.&quot;

If Tsuwabuki could have gotten much paler, he would have. &quot;You might 
not have gotten any warning then,&quot; he said softly.

&quot;You made a mistake,&quot; Utena said grimly, &quot;not only putting yourself 
and your comrades in danger, but the Princess as well.&quot;

Tsuwabuki gulped, then he nodded miserably.

&quot;But you recovered, sent the message back to us and managed to help,&quot; 
Utena noted. A slight smile, &quot;The only reason I&#39;ll forgive you is that 
no one on our side died.&quot; A short pause, &quot;Don&#39;t ever screw up like 
that again.&quot; With that, she strode away.

The bodies had been stacked together to one side of the road, and 
Utena noted with some approval that Juri had begun to prepare the 
party to move out. Juri looked up to meet Utena&#39;s gaze, &quot;What do you 
want to do with them?&quot; She nodded to the bodies.

&quot;If I was back with the mercenaries, I&#39;d leave them there as a feast 
for the carrion birds,&quot; Utena smiled bleakly, &quot;and as a warning to 
anyone else.&quot; She took a deep breath, &quot;But I doubt the princess would 
approve.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Juri admitted.

Not far away from them Anthy was being assisted back up into her 
carriage by her personal maid, Wakaba, and the young noblewoman looked 
awfully pale. She noticed Utena&#39;s gaze on her and smiled at Utena 
wanly.

&quot;Burn the bodies,&quot; Utena said, &quot;right before we move out again. We&#39;ll 
get a few miles between us and them, then camp for the night.&quot;

Shiori came up to them, holding up the black rose pendant before 
asking, &quot;Do you want me to keep this, or leave it here?&quot;

&quot;Keep it,&quot; Juri nodded, &quot;we don&#39;t have anything else to identify there 
men, and it&#39;s unusual enough that it might be useful to trace.&quot;

They moved out, and Utena hung back a moment to put the torch to the 
improvised funeral pyres. &quot;May whatever gods you worshipped take in 
your souls,&quot; she said, tossing the torch up on to one of the pyres.

&quot;You&#39;ve done that before?&quot; Anthy asked as Utena settled into her place 
beside her carriage.

Utena nodded, &quot;A few times. We don&#39;t always know, even with our own 
soldiers, what faiths they might have followed.&quot;

Quietly Anthy said, &quot;This was almost a game until now, a summer 
stroll.&quot;

Utena reached out, gently holding Anthy&#39;s hand in her own. &quot;I will 
always protect you, I promise,&quot; Utena vowed.

They traveled for about an hour before setting up camp for the night. 
The guards stationed all around the camp were more attentive tonight, 
and conversation around the campfires was much more subdued. Tsuwabuki 
sighed softly, picking at his meal.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Keiko asked him softly.

&quot;Juri didn&#39;t put me on guard duty tonight,&quot; Tsuwabuki sighed, &quot;I guess 
she and Utena don&#39;t trust me anymore.&quot; An odd little smile was on 
Keiko&#39;s face, and he asked softly, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Everyone who fought against the bandits isn&#39;t on guard, you&#39;ll 
notice,&quot; Keiko pointed out. She spooned up some stew, &quot;Shiori tells me 
that&#39;s how Utena usually works, resting her fighters so that they&#39;ll 
be ready when she needs them.&quot;

Tsuwabuki sat up straighter, &quot;You think so?&quot;

Keiko nodded, &quot;Makes sense to me.&quot;

It was quiet around the Princess&#39; fire. Juri and Shiori sat together, 
Miki, then Utena and Anthy, and finally Wakaba. The couples sat close 
together, drawing some comfort from the presence of the body beside 
them.

Shiori smiled slightly, pointing at Utena with her spoon, &quot;Did you 
know that I once pursued this woman for months and she didn&#39;t even 
notice?&quot;

Utena met Shiori&#39;s gaze, glad that she was trying to relieve the 
tension a bit. She blushed slightly, &quot;It wasn&#39;t my fault!&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Anthy asked Shiori curiously. She had wanted to know 
a bit more about Utena&#39;s past, and thought this might give her some 
insight,

&quot;We were in the middle of a pretty miserable campaign in Karse when I 
first really noticed Utena. I was helping with triage in the medics 
tent when this soldier gruffly ordered a healer to help his friend, 
now, and then he threatened her with a sword,&quot; Shiori said.

Anthy noticed Utena get redder, and began to guess who the &#39;man&#39; was.

&quot;So I threw a sleeping spell at him, and was surprised to see it 
didn&#39;t work. Then someone noticed that it was Commander Tarma, and the 
medics jumped to it. The man staggered to a corner, wiped the mud off 
his face,&quot; Shiori paused dramatically, &quot;and I was struck by the 
brightest blue eyes I&#39;d ever seen.&quot;

Wakaba nodded, and Anthy smiled as she murmured, &quot;I know what you 
mean.&quot;

Utena didn&#39;t blush any brighter, but she did look down into her bowl 
to avoid the amused gazes of her companions.

&quot;You were wearing the Sword of Dios, that&#39;s why the spell failed?&quot; 
Juri asked.

Utena kept her face down, and nodded.

&quot;I eventually found out it was a woman, a newly promoted lieutenant 
named Tenjou Utena,&quot; Shiori smiled. She sipped her drink, &quot;And then 
and there I made the foolish decision that she&#39;d be my next romantic 
conquest.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Juri asked curiously.

Shiori shrugged. &quot;I tried everything. Feminine wiles, food, scanty 
clothing, a few unexpected midnight visits,&quot; she ticked them off on 
her fingers, &quot;and none of it worked.&quot;

Wakaba looked over at the mage, who was clearly a very attractive 
woman, then over to Utena. &quot;Why...?&quot; she trailed off.

Utena shrugged, &quot;I&#39;d just gotten promoted, and was still trying to 
figure out how to do the job.&quot; She smiled sheepishly, &quot;I really didn&#39;t 
notice her too much. I guess I thought that she only wanted to be 
friends.&quot;

A beat of silence, then quiet laughter around the circle. The 
conversation moved along a bit better after that, and not long after 
they retired to their beds.

&quot;Did you really not notice her?&quot; Anthy asked her quietly, feeling warm 
and safe in the circle of Utena&#39;s arms.

&quot;Hate to say it, but yes,&quot; Utena smiled. &quot;I&#39;m just glad that she got 
distracted by a girl named Usagi,&quot; she added. A moment of silence, 
&quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;About what happened today?&quot; Anthy asked softly. She felt Utena&#39;s nod 
and quietly said, &quot;No, not really. But I will be.&quot;

&quot;Good enough,&quot; Utena held her close.</pre>
