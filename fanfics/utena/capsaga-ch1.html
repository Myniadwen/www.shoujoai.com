<h1>The Capital Saga (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../utena/index.html">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>

<pre>        Commander Kiryuu Nanami gazed at the knights she had gathered 
in the main hall of the guard&#39;s quarters, her expression grave. 
&quot;Couriers have reported that the princess left the castle in the west 
days ago, but our scouts have seen no sign of her,&quot; she explained.

        &quot;Then we must find her!&quot; Vaun spoke up.

        Nanami gave the dark haired young man a nod, &quot;Exactly my 
intention. I will be leaving my second in charge here and taking a 
small number of knights with me.&quot;

        &quot;Won&#39;t that be dangerous?&quot; Eiko asked, pushing her red hair 
back casually.

        &quot;I hope we&#39;ll make up in speed what we will lack in power,&quot; 
she explained. Before Nanami could continue on a page rushed inside 
carrying a sheet of paper.

        &quot;M&#39;lady!&quot; he thrust the note at her.

        Nanami read it, puffing her breath out in relief. Relief, and 
just a bit of disappointment at not being able to act. &quot;The princess 
has been sighted at last,&quot; she smiled, then commanded, &quot;Form up an 
honor guard, we must go out to meet her!&quot;

        They quickly mounted up, leaving the outer gates in moments to 
wait outside for any sign of the princess&#39; arrival. &quot;I&#39;ve never met 
her before,&quot; Vaun asked Nanami softly, &quot;what is she like?&quot;

        &quot;When I met her the princess was mourning her brother&#39;s 
exile,&quot; Nanami said to him softly, &quot;but even then she carried herself 
with grace and dignity. If my obligation to the King would have 
allowed it, I think I would have gladly followed her to the western 
palace.&quot;

        &quot;We would have missed you,&quot; Kencyr said softly. The grizzled 
old trooper blushed under her gentle smile.

        &quot;There they are,&quot; Eiko murmured as the group crested the hill.

        &quot;Forward,&quot; Nanami ordered crisply. The band reached the 
travelers; position in only a few moments, gleaming in their silvery, 
well cleaned armor. Nanami blinked in surprise at the ragged band that 
followed the Princess Anthy, in their scarred leather armor and dirty 
steeds. &#39;Did she have to hire mercenaries?&#39; she wondered.

        &quot;Be on your guard,&quot; Vaun said to the others softly, &quot;I really 
don&#39;t like the looks of the pink haired one standing by the princess&#39; 
carriage.&quot;

        Nanami dismounted from her horse carefully, so as not to 
embarrass herself, then she reached up to remove her helm and release 
her long, golden hair. She knelt down there, murmuring, &quot;Princess, we 
have long awaited your return.&quot;

        Anthy nodded to her regally, stepping out of the carriage to 
stand before her. &quot;Commander Nanami, it&#39;s good to see you,&quot; she said 
with real warmth in her voice.

        Nanami rose, tucking her helm under her arm. The blonde looked 
over at Juri and Utena in disdain. &quot;And who are these?&quot; Nanami asked 
the Princess softly.

        Anthy frowned, &quot;Tenjou Utena, the captain of my personal 
guard,&quot; and she smiled slightly, &quot;as well as your new superior 
officer.&quot;

        Nanami gaped in surprise, &quot;What?!&quot;

        There was a long moment of silence as both groups digested 
that little bombshell. Utena seemed to recover first, stepping forward 
to say, &quot;It&#39;s an honor to meet you, Commander.&quot;

        Nanami shook herself, &quot;And I, to meet you.&quot; She looked over 
her knights, &quot;We will escort the Princess and her guard into the 
city.&quot;

        Anthy sighed softly, returning to the inside of her carriage. 
They moved off smoothly, and she thought of how different her arrival 
here was to her coming to the western palace. Sun instead of rain, a 
trusted honor guard, and her love riding beside her door.

        Anthy gestured Utena to ride closer, &quot;You might want to go 
speak with Nanami.&quot;

        Utena smiled and chuckled softly, &quot;I was just about to ask if 
you&#39;d mind if I did so after we reached the palace.&quot;

        They passed through the gates to the outer city, and the 
streets were soon lined with cheering people welcoming their princess 
and next queen home at last. Flags bearing the red rose of Ohtori were 
waved, streamers blew, and the occasional fireworks was set off.

        Anthy knew that Utena would not leave her side here, but she 
was surprised to see similar intent expressions on her and Nanami&#39;s 
faces. They both scanned the crowds, ready for anyone that might mean 
to cause any trouble. &#39;They&#39;re alike in many ways,&#39; Anthy thought, &#39;I 
just hope that means they&#39;ll get along, rather than kill each other.&#39;

        &quot;Incredible,&quot; Juri murmured as they approached the great 
castle of Shi&#39;Ohtori itself. Massive towers reached to the sky, and 
it&#39;s walls almost seemed to glow slightly in the light of the setting 
sun.

        &quot;There&#39;s an strong aura of magic about this place,&quot; Shiori 
said to them softly, &quot;but I&#39;m not entirely certain of what type.&quot;

        &quot;Lovely,&quot; Utena smiled wryly.

        &quot;Isn&#39;t it,&quot; Anthy agreed. &quot;Well, we managed to deal with 
magics of a darker variety once, we&#39;ll just have to be prepared to do 
it again here.&quot;

        They reached the Palace itself soon enough, and Miki quickly 
took charge. He sent Wakaba off with the palace staff to make sure the 
Princess&#39; rooms were ready, and along with Juri began to get the 
members of Anthy&#39;s guards housed and fed.

        Keiko tried to hang back, avoiding the Palace guards, but she 
just wasn&#39;t that lucky. The crowd parted, Nanami looked up, and her 
face went pale. &quot;Keiko?&quot; Nanami barely whispered.

        &quot;Nanami,&quot; Keiko nodded uncomfortably. They gazed at each other 
a moment, then Keiko broke away with a soft, &quot;I have to go.&quot;

        Nanami moved to follow her but stopped herself, she still had 
to speak to the Princess. She turned to meet Utena&#39;s gaze, looking at 
her curiously. &quot;How can I be of service?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;I wanted to talk to you, along with the Princess,&quot; Utena said 
softly.

        Nanami nodded, &quot;I&#39;d like to bring my second along as well.&quot; 
She hesitated, &quot;I wanted to apologize, for how I acted outside. I 
jumped to conclusions about you without waiting to see whom you might 
actually be.&quot;

        Utena actually smiled back, &quot;I&#39;m well aware how we look, 
Commander, though I&#39;m hoping a few days rest and some clean clothes 
will help make up for it.&quot;

        &#39;She accepted my apology most gracefully,&#39; Nanami noted with 
some relief. She smiled at her, &quot;Call me Nanami.&quot;

        &quot;And you can call me Utena,&quot; she offered her hand. At Nanami&#39;s 
mildly surprised look she added, &quot;It seems we&#39;ll be working closely.&quot;

        &quot;Indeed, Utena,&quot; Nanami shook it firmly.

        &quot;I&#39;m always amazed at how easily she does that,&quot; Shiori noted.

        &quot;Does what?&quot; Juri asked her quietly.

        &quot;Turns a potential enemy into a possible friend,&quot; Shiori 
smiled. &quot;She did that back in the mercenaries, too, soothing fights 
and making peace.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s hope all our problems are solved so easily,&quot; Juri 
smiled.

        The room was dark, and the figure there sat in shadows. &quot;It 
seems I could not bar their way here,&quot; he murmured, &quot;but that will 
simply make things all the sweeter.&quot;

        He got up, his old fashioned military uniform hugging his slim 
form. &quot;I cannot reach the brother, to make him pay for what he has 
done,&quot; he sighed. A smile, dangerous and just a bit mad glints in the 
darkness, &quot;But his sister will serve in his place.&quot;

        A pale hand touches the sleeping face of a dusky skinned 
figure, and his expression is sorrowful, &quot;She will pay most dearly for 
his treachery.&quot;</pre>
