<h1>Miyuki-chan in Hospital Land</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../miyuki/index.html">Miyuki-chan in Wonderland</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lppyro.html">LadyPrince Pyro</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: Ha ha ha. I recently got to read and watch Miyuki-chan in 
Wonderland at a friend&#39;s house and couldn&#39;t seem to stop grinning. The 
antics and situations that poor girl gets into are simply classic. I 
find the comic version to be much more enjoyable than the really short 
animated version, simply because it gives you a much broader scope on 
Miyuki herself and her odd aura of &#39;kawaii-ness&#39;. So this one-shot 
story is my sad attempt to try and blend in with that multiverse!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

One day would have been considered a fluke. Two days was just a 
bothersome twinge. Three days was pushing it a bit, but it had been 
five full days before Miyuki gave in and realized she needed to go see 
a doctor. Which wasn&#39;t a very exciting idea of course, since this whole 
predicament was the result of being too over-eager in gym class. Or was 
it from running for her life (and virginity) all the time?

...Hmmm... 

Either way, her sharp back pains were just not going away by 
themselves. So giving into having to call up her stuffy family doctor,  
and taking care to be extra cautious about brushing her hair in front 
of the mirror, the blonde school girl made her way to the office. 
Wincingly she rubbed her back as she walked down the sidewalk, feeling 
and looking like a tired old man.

Thankfully the place wasn&#39;t too far, otherwise she would have had 
to struggle with riding her bike. Five blocks down from her house, the 
crisp clinical building came into view. Chewing her thumbnail 
thoughtfully, she paused outside the automatic doors. 

That&#39;s funny, She thought to herself. I don&#39;t remember it being this big. 
Although it has been a while since my last physical. I guess the clinic 
had...renevations...and expanded? 

She stepped up to the doors, and they wooshed open to allow her entry. 
Walking up to the front desk, careful to mind her sore muscles, she 
signed in on the waiting sign-in sheet. The receptionist swiveled in 
her chair and picked up the clipboard took look at it thoughtfully. &quot;Oh 
my! Miyuki...such a cute name!&quot; Miyuki looked up at this, noticing with 
rising suspicion at how attractive the lady at the desk was. Her rich 
red hair styled into a neat bun and her uniform extremely low cut. The 
woman adjusted her square glasses and leaned forward to snatch up the 
startled girl&#39;s hand.

&quot;Oh my...and you have such lovely blue eyes...just what ails you, 
dear?&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s eye twitched dangerously as she yanked her hand from the 
woman&#39;s grasp. 

&quot;A-ah...my back...hurts.&quot; She was suddenly having a very bad feeling 
all of a sudden.

The woman gave a pouting smile, leaned forward so that her 
generous breasts were now right in Miyuki&#39;s line of sight. &quot;Mmmm...I 
just bet it does! Oh my...such a naughty girl!&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s eye twitching was going into overdrive as she took 
several fearful steps back towards the safety of the double doors. &quot;A-
ah you know what? I-I don&#39;t really need that appointment after all!&quot; 
She turned to exit, only to find the doors were gone. Wildly darting 
her head around, she tried to locate where they had gone to, but it was 
as if they had disappeared into thin air. Frantically she darted back 
around, only to find herself in a long hallway filled with doors and 
medical equipment as far as she could see.  

&quot;W-what? Now hold on a minute here.&quot; She began walking slowly 
down the hall, looking for a way out or maybe someone who could help 
her. But as her shoes squeaked ever so slightly, a sudden cry from 
behind her rang out.

&quot;There you are Miyuki darling!! We haven&#39;t finished your 
registration yet!&quot; It was the buxom red head, and she was packing heat. 
With the crack of her riding crop, several front desk assitants began 
to coo and murmur amongst themselves as they all gave chase.

&quot;Aiiiii! Why do these things always happen to me?!&quot; Teary eyed, 
Miyuki just barely managed to dodge a flying tackle from a blonde with 
short cropped hair, when her back gave a painful lurch. Crying out, she 
braced it with one hand while looking around for a means of escape. 
Hobbling as best she could, she ducked around a corner and dove into 
one of the rooms. Shutting the door and panting hard, she waited as she 
heard the stampede of crazed women run by. Once the cries of &#39;Miyuki-
chan!&#39; had faded she turned to get a better look at her 
surroundings...

Only to find her face stuffed into something firm, warm, 
and...well...round.

&quot;Oh ho ho ho! Well aren&#39;t we eager!&quot;

Gasping for breath, Miyuki reared back blushing furiously. She 
found herself being led over to a paper covered examination table, and 
was soon hopped up with her legs dangling off the side. The nurse, 
(because who else would wear that paper hat with the big red cross on 
it.ignoring the mini skirt and unbuttoned blouse?) checked her 
temperature and felt her forehead. 

&quot;Oh my my my...you are a bit warm, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She let the hand 
linger and slowly slide down to cup the cute little blonde&#39;s chin. 
Sultrily the nurse leaned over the girl, making quite certain her 
breasts raked over Miyuki&#39;s own. &quot;Why...I&#39;m beginning to feel hot 
myself.&quot; Terrified and about to faint from blushing so hard, Miyuki 
tried to scoot away only to hear a loud &#39;harrumph&#39;.

The nurse leapt back sheepishly and turned to bow at the doorway. 
&quot;Ah! Forgive me Doctor Watanabe! She&#39;s all yours.&quot;  Stepping aside with 
clip board in hand, the nurse demurely waited for the tall doctor to 
come striding in. The doctor herself was very cool and professional 
looking. Long flowing black hair was pulled back into a loose ponytail, 
and a pair of thin rimmed spectacles was situated low on her nose. With 
the air of experience, she motioned for Miyuki to sit up forward. 

Gulping slightly, the blonde did so, unconsciously sitting straighter. 
The doctor pulled on a pair of gloves and began going over her vitals 
with her stethoscope. Not once did anything funny happen, and Miyuki 
began to relax a bit in the new clinical atmosphere. She went through 
the pains of having her reflexes checked with the little hammer, her 
blood pressure taken, her temperature taken (properly) all with the 
doctor woman merely giving short crisp instructions. 

Once the small physical was over, the doctor took the clipboard from the 
nurse, who was busy bustling at the counters of medicine and instruments. 
The doctor, who gave Miyuki a reassuring smile, took a seat in the chair 
in front of her table and began to go over the sheets. &quot;Hmmm...so you are 
suffering from severe back pains then? Perhaps brought about by 
overexertion and strain at work or school? Yes I see, hmmm...alright then 
I&#39;m going to need you to take off your shirt please.&quot; Miyuki blinked in 
confusion, so the bespectacled doctor continued, &quot;I&#39;d like to pin-point 
exactly where the problem is, so we can diagnose a cure.&quot; 

That made sense, Miyuki thought to herself, even if she was a bit 
wary about undressing in front of that crazy nurse. But at least the 
doctor was here to supervise. She seemed nice enough. The doctor 
removed her glasses, revealing a pair of piercing blue eyes as she 
watched Miyuki hesitantly lift her shirt. Finally sighing, she motioned 
to the nurse, &quot;Aki-chan? Please give Miyuki-chan a hand.I believe her 
back pains are making things difficult for her.&quot;

&quot;Why of course Watanabe-sensei! I&#39;d be absolutely delighted to!&quot;

&quot;W-wait a second, I really don&#39;t--!!&quot;

&quot;Oh stop squirming, you tasty little morsel! We&#39;ll have this off 
of you in a moment!&quot; The nurse&#39;s hands were strangely more focused on 
what was underneath the shirt than in getting the shirt off.

&quot;Kyaa!! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; Miyuki fitfully tried to tug the shirt 
down again, and keep those searching hands from going any lower.

&quot;What, this? Oh my! Oh ho ho ho, are we a bit ticklish there? If 
you think you&#39;re squirming now...mmmm...wait till I visit you later.&quot;

Sei Watanabe gave another sigh, &quot;Aki-chan.&quot; The nurse gave a nod 
of understanding and popped the shirt up and over Miyuki&#39;s head, 
leaving the poor girl blushing and shivering slightly on the 
examination table. The doctor moved forward and began feeling her back 
and shoulders.

&quot;Hmmm...does this hurt? No? Okay then, try raising your right 
arm.oh my what a cute bra you have on.okay now cough please.&quot; The best 
Miyuki managed to do was a slight &#39;Eep!&#39;. The doctor&#39;s latex hands were 
slipping low on her back making her shiver once more. Still blushing 
she said, &quot;A-ah...the pain is a little higher there...not...so far 
low...?&quot; The doctor tsked her in reply.

&quot;Several muscles can pull and cause strain on other muscles. I 
need to locate the point of strain, then we can prescribe you some 
muscle relaxants to help with the pain.&quot; The doctor&#39;s long fingers 
trailed along her shoulder blades, skimming heatedly across the edge of 
her bra. Miyuki&#39;s eye twitched again worriedly, but she tried to hold 
still.

&quot;Oh...oh okay then.&quot;

The doctor had now felt and massaged all across the skin of her 
back, making mild comments about certain muscles that the nurse grinned 
about and wrote down on her note pad. She watched the two of them with 
a darkly heated gaze, nibbling on her pen as her hand slipped from 
view. Miyuki was suddenly very very concerned. And that was putting it 
mildly. 

It didn&#39;t get any better when she felt her bra unclasp in the 
back and fall away. With a startled cry, she held the front of her bra 
tightly to her chest, her face as red as a tomato. &quot;W-why are you--?!&quot; 
The doctor was now murmuring close into her ear, her voice had lowered 
an octave and was as smokey and sultry as any of the characters she had 
met on her &#39;adventures&#39;. 

&quot;Mmmm...Miyuki...it really is a cute name.I think I&#39;ve found the 
problem, Miyuki...chan.&quot; She felt a larger pair of hands slip across her 
stomach and cup her breasts. Their hands were brushing against one 
another, and Miyuki suddenly knew she had a Code Red. 

&quot;Why, with your delicious endowment...&quot; a firm squeeze that turned 
into a massage as the doctor began to nuzzle her patient intimately, 
&quot;It&#39;s no wonder your back hurts! Nurse Aki?&quot;

&quot;Hai, sensei!&quot; The nurse looking very much turned on came over 
with a frighteningly large needle. Miyuki couldn&#39;t move, pinned as she 
was by the older woman. She felt a prick in her arm, and an odd feeling 
of relaxation.

&quot;There now...doesn&#39;t that feel good? Sensei and I will show you  
just how good you can feel..&quot;

Miyuki felt the nurse sidled in front of her, grasping her 
shoulders and neck, and slowly the room blanked out.

Waking up from her awkward position at the kitchen table, the 
blonde yawned and wiped her mouth to get the drool off. Had she fallen 
asleep after homework? Ugh...her back was stiff now from sleeping so 
oddly. Shaking her head to clear it of the faint fragments of her 
dream, she yawned again and headed for the fridge. A snack sounded 
good.why did she have such crazy dreams all the time? But just as she 
was putting back the milk, sipping from a glass, she sputtered it back 
out on the floor. There on the door was a cheerful hand written 
prescription, held on by a magnet shaped like a bunny.


Good for one free check up.
Come by any time!
