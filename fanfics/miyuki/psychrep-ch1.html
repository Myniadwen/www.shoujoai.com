<h1>The Psychiatric Report</h1>

<pre>        The tall redhead grinned, practicing raising the whip up 
over her head as she stalked down the deserted hallway. The leather 
corset, thigh high leather boots and matching red bra and panties 
she wore hugged her many charms without revealing all too much of 
them. She came around a corner and her grin grew wider.

        &quot;There you are, Miyuki-chan!&quot; she cried happily.

        CRACK! the whip came down like a shot!

        &quot;Whaa! Why do these things keep happening to me!&quot; Miyuki 
wailed, her cute long brown hair swirling around, her skirt flying 
up to reveal long legs and just a hint of panty.

        The redhead chuckled softly, her emerald eyes narrowing 
slightly.....

The files of Dr. Nicole Igrarashi

        Meeting Miss Miyuki was rather an unusual occurrence for me. 
As an clinical expert in sexual deviancy most of my psychiatric 
patients are referred to me by other doctors, the major clinics and 
occasionally by concerned family members of the patient themselves. 
But Miyuki researched my qualifications and then made contact with 
my secretary Mokona all on her own. It seemed she was having 
problems with sexual dreams...

        After a bit of oddity on her first appointment with me (For 
some reason my assistant Nanase and Mokona felt that Miyuki needed 
to have a full physical exam, administered while she was in the 
nude. I&#39;ve asked them to explain why they did that, but they seem 
unable to.) we settled down to discussing her problems.

        Looking at the young woman who was laying back on the couch 
I was instantly struck by how cute this Miyuki was. It wasn&#39;t the 
innocently wide blue eyes, the attractive face, long brown hair or 
the sweet schoolgirl&#39;s uniform she wore, but some indefinable 
quality she possessed. A charm, if you will, that even I found 
myself distracted by.

        But once Miyuki actually began discussing her dreams with 
me, I assure you that I paid very close attention! Follows is a 
transcript of one of our first sessions:

Miyuki: It all feels so real! I keep having these strange things 
happening to me!

Nicole: Oh?

Miyuki: I keep getting my clothes ripped off! Then random girls 
start feeling me up! Whenever I think I&#39;ve escaped them, it starts 
all over again!

Nicole: hmm, clothes torn off.. Oh, sorry! Well, under what sort of 
circumstances does this usually happen to you?

Miyuki: Well, there was Mistress...

Nicole: Mistress?

Miyuki: She seemed to be the ruler, she chased me around a castle 
with a big whip. Then there was the evil queen in the science 
fiction movie that had her way with me...

Nicole: (softly) I&#39;m beginning to see a pattern here.

Miyuki: and then there was the battle waitresses, and the strip Mah-
jongg girl...

Nicole: Strip Mah-jongg?

Miyuki: (sounds thoughtful) and the Incubus girl from the videogame, 
and Hinoto, Kanoe, Satsuki, Karen, Arashi and Yuzuriha from the 
X1999 manga&#39;s...

Nicole: yum, group...

        As you can see, I was entirely professional throughout the 
therapy process. As the sessions progressed I had Miyuki discuss 
each and every adventure in great detail, sometimes twice or even 
three times. Together we explored the feelings the characters in the 
dreams inspired in her, even as I worked to determine the basis of 
her problem. Follows is another transcript:

Miyuki: the Cheshire cat startled me, coming down out of the tree. I 
asked her what was going on, but she just ignored me, using her 
tongue to clean a paw.

Nicole: And then what happened?

Miyuki: She grabbed me by the collar and asked my name. When I told 
her she said I was cute, and asked if I wanted to see something 
interesting. I refused, but she pounced on me.

Nicole: hmm, I wonder what that tongue would feel like...

Miyuki: What?

Nicole: Sorry, thinking aloud. So what happened next?

Miyuki: I found myself at Mistress&#39; feet. She was dressed in reddish 
black leather, boots, gloves and a matching corset, fishnet 
stockings attached with garters. Her long blonde hair was swept 
back, topped by a golden crown. She commanded me to lick her boots, 
and I ran.

Nicole: And she went after you with a whip...

Miyuki: She wrapped me in the whip, started dragging me back towards 
her... then I woke up.

        In working with Miyuki for the past month I&#39;ve had to come 
to certain conclusions about her. She&#39;s so cute... no, that&#39;s not 
it. A minor problem is Miyuki&#39;s fascination with costumes, and 
people being stripped out of them. But I believe that most of 
Miyuki&#39;s problems stem from sexual repression, specifically a denial 
of her own sexuality. By having these fantasy figures take advantage 
of her, she can experience lesbian sex, but does not have to 
actually consent to it.

        Curing her, however, may be more difficult.

        After some deliberation, I think I may have a possible 
solution. It may be a bit extreme, but a kind of shock therapy may 
be necessary to help Miyuki finally accept her sexuality. Both 
Nanase and Mokona are quite willing to cooperate, and the costume 
rental company assures me I can have the dominatrix outfit by 
tomorrow night, just in time for our next session.

        &quot;Whaa! Why do these things keep happening to me!&quot; Miyuki 
wailed as she ran, giving Nicole an excellent view of her panties.

        Nicole chuckled as she herded Miyuki along to where Mokona 
and Nanase were waiting, Once they jumped Miyuki it would be 
Nicole&#39;s turn, and this time, she&#39;d make sure Miyuki would finished 
her little fantasy with Mistress...

Never the end...

Author&#39;s Note: A nearly pointless piece of pure silliness about 
Miyuki-chan in wonderland. I had been considering writing something 
like this for awhile now, but buying the Miyuki-chan manga pretty 
much convinced me. The psychiatrist, not to mention her assistants, 
all fell under Miyuki&#39;s kawaii spell pretty quickly. And any real-
world psychiatrist who did this would be in a lot of trouble, very 
fast. The names Nanase, Mokona and Igarashi are all from the members 
of CLAMP, and the line &#39;Never the end&#39; is from the Miyuki mangas. </pre>
