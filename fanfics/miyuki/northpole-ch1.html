<h1>Miyuki-chan in North Pole Land</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../miyuki/index.html">Miyuki-chan in Wonderland</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hearing her parents leave the room Miyuki fought back a smile, the brown 
haired young woman continuing to pretend she was asleep for a few 
moments more. Once she was sure they were gone Miyuki carefully turned 
on her light, trying to be silent as she saw the waiting Christmas 
stocking loaded up with candy, just like every year.

&quot;This is one of my favorite traditions,&quot; Miyuki murmured happily, taking 
the stocking and carefully spilling it out onto the bedspread. There 
were candy canes, chocolate snowballs, foil wrapped treats and small 
toys, all waiting for the morning snacking to begin.

About to set the stocking aside Miyuki frowned thoughtfully, feeling a 
weight in the end of the red stocking. She peered inside to see a glint 
of something, then reached inside, feeling about with her fingers. 
Carefully she grasped something in the bottom, a elusive shape, then 
suddenly she was yanked into the stocking!

&quot;Waaah!&quot; Miyuki cried out in alarm as she was suddenly falling, cold air 
rushing over her pajamas. &quot;Why do these things always have to happen to 
me!&quot; she wailed, looking around frantically for something to grab onto.

Wumph!

Miyuki landed on a pile of something soft, sprawled out as she shook her 
head dazedly. Sitting up she looked around, soon realizing she had 
fallen into a bin full of teddy bears. Quickly she climbed out of the 
small bin, looking around her in awe even as she tried to figure out 
exactly where she was and what was going to happen to her now. 
Stretching out around her were bins, each one filled with a different 
type of toy. Bears, dolls, cars, and dozens of others, they all were 
waiting for some unnamed purpose.

&quot;Are you all right, dear?&quot; the quiet voice asked pleasantly from right 
behind her.

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Miyuki whirled around, blinking in surprise as she saw the woman 
standing there. Her hair was pure silver, but despite her age she looked 
beautiful, blue eyes twinkling as she looked Miyuki over thoughtfully. 
She wore a long red coat trimmed in fur, glossy leather boots sticking 
out the bottom and white gloves.

Smoothly she stepped up to Miyuki&#39;s side, her breath showing in the cold 
air as she added, &quot;You must be cold dressed in those cute pajamas.&quot;

&quot;Y-yes,&quot; Miyuki stammered realizing that it was bitingly cold in the 
large room. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked her weakly, blinking as the taller 
woman slid a fur clad arm over her shoulders and leading her towards a 
nearby door.

&quot;Mrs. Clause, of course,&quot; she said mildly, her arm tightening around 
Miyuki as she opened the door, going into a much more cozy room. A fire 
burned in the fireplace, a pot of tea waiting nearby for anyone who 
needed it.

&quot;I&#39;m in another strange place, again,&quot; Miyuki softly sighed as Mrs. 
Clause parked her in front of the fire to warm up.

&quot;You&#39;re at Santa&#39;s workshop at the north pole,&quot; Mrs. Clause confirmed 
cheerfully, studying Miyuki. Then without a further word she stepped 
forward and began to unbutton Miyuki&#39;s top!

&quot;Hey!&quot; Miyuki protested, trying to grab at her hands, surprised at how 
easily the woman could bat her hands aside.

&quot;You can&#39;t keep wearing that,&quot; Mrs. Clause purred, &quot;you&#39;ll freeze.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Miyuki started then squealed as her pants were yanked down.

&quot;Bear panties,&quot; Mrs. Clause chuckled at the little cartoon, &quot;that&#39;s so 
cute.&quot; In a second she got her top and bottoms off, the returned with a 
fur lined bundle. &quot;Here,&quot; her fingers lingered on Miyuki&#39;s hands as she 
passed the clothes over, &quot;they should fit.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; the fiercely blushing Miyuki pulled the clothes on, 
blinking a bit at the oddness. The mini-skirt barely covered her bottom, 
while the top was so brief her breasts strained the cloth, yet oddly the 
clothes were keeping her toasty warm. &quot;How...?&quot; she looked up at Mrs. 
Clause.

The older woman laughed softly, her eyes roaming over Miyuki&#39;s slim 
body. &quot;It&#39;s a special quality of the clothes,&quot; she murmured as she 
stepped nearer, her impressive bust brushing against Miyuki, &quot;keeps us 
all nice and warm.&quot;

&#39;Uh oh,&#39; Miyuki thought, recognizing the predatory look in the beautiful 
older woman&#39;s eyes.

A hand cupped Miyuki&#39;s chin as Mrs. Clause purred, &quot;You know, since 
Nicky retired I&#39;ve been so lonely up here...&quot;

&quot;Uh, I...&quot; Miyuki stammered.

Before she could move a gentle hand was on her bottom, Mrs. Clause&#39;s 
other hand around her shoulders as she kissed her hungrily. A hand 
tugged up the bottom of her skirt to stroke Miyuki&#39;s panty clad bottom, 
then the other slid around to squeeze a firm breast.

&quot;Sorry!&quot; With practiced ease Miyuki squirmed out of her grip, bolting 
out the door even as she called over her shoulder, &quot;Thanks for the 
clothes!&quot;

&quot;You are not getting away that easy,&quot; the breathless Mrs. Clause said as 
she hurried after her.

Miyuki raced through the toy warehouse, trying to see how she had gotten 
here in the first place, but there seemed to be nothing unusual. 
&#39;Another door,&#39; Miyuki noticed, silently debating if she should go 
inside.

&quot;Miyuki-chan!&quot; Mrs. Clause called, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not going to hurt 
you!&quot;

&#39;Got to be better than here,&#39; Miyuki thought, opening the door and 
running in. She turned and latched the door before leaning against it 
head first.

&quot;Well, well,&quot; a new voice cooed, &quot;what have we here?&quot;

&#39;Why didn&#39;t I check to see if there was someone here?&#39; Miyuki thought 
despairingly as she spun around, looking around wildly.

The room was filled with elves, probably the ones that worked in Santa&#39;s 
workshop, but they weren&#39;t what she was expecting. Instead of pint sized 
little men they were adult women, all gorgeous looking, and all wearing 
little bikini shorts and matching tops.

&quot;I think we&#39;ve got a Christmas present this year,&quot; a tall, redheaded elf 
drawled, looking at Miyuki like she was some tasty morsel.

Before Miyuki could react a petite blonde stepped forward, pressing her 
lips to Miyuki&#39;s and stealing her breath. Another laughed, &quot;Hey, I 
wanted to be first.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s enough to go around,&quot; the blonde smiled, 
sliding a hand up Miyuki&#39;s thigh.

Kicking her legs Miyuki wiggled free, wheeling around to open the door. 
Bolting forward she was stopped almost immediately by something soft. 
&quot;Well,&quot; Mrs. Clause laughed, Miyuki&#39;s face pressed between her breasts, 
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were so eager.&quot;

&quot;Miyuki?&quot; an Elf asked, eyes twinkling, &quot;So cute!&quot;

&quot;Eeep,&quot; dodging both of their attempts to grab her Miyuki raced forward, 
brown hair flying as she looked over her shoulder to see if she was 
being followed.

Crash!

&quot;Oweee,&quot; the white haired young woman dressed in a matching outfit to 
Miyuki&#39;s looked up at her from where they fell to the floor, Miyuki 
awkwardly sprawled on top of her.

&quot;Christine?&quot; Miyuki blinked, recognizing the daughter of Santa Clause 
that she had met last year. &#39;I thought it was just a dream,&#39; she 
mentally whimpered, &#39;guess not.&#39;

&quot;Hello, Miyuki-chan,&quot; Christine smiled as she helped them both up, blue 
eyes twinkling.

&quot;Miyuki!&quot; They could hear both Mrs. Clause and the elves looking for 
her, as well as occasionally squabbling over who got her first.

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Christine sighed, &quot;guess I should have made sure to be here 
when you arrived, huh?&quot; Smoothly she drew her toward the sitting room 
Miyuki had been in with Mrs. Clause, then opened another door to reveal 
a hallway and stairs.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Miyuki asked, mildly thankful that Christine 
wasn&#39;t mauling her or trying to pull her clothes off. &#39;Yet,&#39; she added 
mentally.

&quot;My room,&quot; Christine said as she led Miyuki upstairs. &quot;I&#39;m just glad my 
sisters Claudia, Chloe, Constance, and Crystal aren&#39;t home, or I&#39;d have 
to share.&quot;

&quot;What am I doing here?&quot; Miyuki asked tiredly as she entered the 
comfortable looking bedroom, the bed made and obviously tidied up for a 
guest.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Christine sat on the side of the bed and gave her a 
sheepish grin. &quot;I kind of summoned you here,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I couldn&#39;t 
get you out of my mind, and I really wanted to see you again.&quot; She 
frowned, &quot;But the North American deliveries took me longer than 
expected, and I wasn&#39;t here when you arrived.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Miyuki blinked. Oddly, she felt sort of complimented that the 
beautiful woman hadn&#39;t been able to forget about their earlier 
encounter... &#39;Not that I could, either,&#39; she admitted, blushing.

A slow smile appeared on Christine&#39;s face, &quot;Did you like the present I 
left you?&quot;

Miyuki blushed fiercely, covering her face with her hands. Christine had 
left her a vibrator last year, one that she thankfully had been able to 
hide before her parents saw it. &quot;Yes, I liked it,&quot; she admitted.

Christine patted the side of the bed invitingly. &quot;I have another present 
for you,&quot; she fingered the laces that held her red leather top closed, 
&quot;if you&#39;d like to help me unwrap it.&quot;

Miyuki met Christina&#39;s eyes and was struck by the caring there, the 
gentleness. Despite her obvious desire she was letting Miyuki make the 
decision... &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Miyuki answered, walking over to her side.

&quot;This could be the best Christmas ever,&quot; she said as Christina pulled 
Miyuki into a kiss.

Never The End...</pre>
