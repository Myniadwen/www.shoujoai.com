<h1>The Mistress of Dragons and Cards (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../yugioh/mistress-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;&#133;your kidding? Someone PRINTED that?&quot; Nina sighs, &quot;Alright, alright.
Update as to what happened since we last had a Mature Reader version of
this story&#133; (if you know it, start humming the theme to &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;
while we run over the details&#133; with a truck).&quot;

&quot;Since W-General didn&#146;t answer my challenge back in Episode 1, I ended 
up fighting a former Pink Panties co-star named Rei Nobringa, and she 
nearly beat me if it wasn&#146;t for my superior gameplay in wearing down 
her monsters and wiping her out. But in the end the victory left me 
rather unfulfilled so I sought a new opponent. That&#146;s when Keiko 
(Grimmlands, Ronin Judgement) challenged me. And, to make it more 
interesting, she challenged me AND tempted me to leave my best cards 
behind (Dark Magician &amp; Blue Eyes White Dragon) before fighting me. It 
was there (At a graveyard field in the burned out section of what used 
Ace Hardware (old industrial area, Kailua-Kona sector)) that she laid 
on me that she wanted to play a &quot;in-house&quot; card (card made here in the 
Realm of Dreams) in our duel. I agreed, we dueled, but it didn&#146;t seem 
we were going anywhere until she opted out and let a new opponent, a 
Normal named the Dmage, play me. He&#146;s been giving me a harsh beating 
since the story started, and that&#146;s where we start off&#133; in the midst of 
the battle between myself and Dmage. The battle&#146;s about to switch from 
Keiko to DMage as we start off&#133;

------------------------------------------------------------------

Suddenly, as Keiko draws her next card, her beeper goes off. Both girls 
grab for their beepers and check. 

&quot;It&#39;s me.&quot; (Keiko clicks the lister on) &quot;...damn... I gotta go. Looks 
like they&#39;re going with Plan 3 for the big project and I&#39;m part of it. 
(I get to play the rough and tumble girl of the lovely pairing).&quot; 

&quot;Say hi to your boyfriend for me.&quot; Nina slyly remarks. 

&quot;...after you botched Nene&#39;s orientation in Episode 3 (Yugiohdungeon) 
you don&#39;t think people have the slightest notion there&#39;s a few women 
here with... oh, heck, I have to go.&quot; (grabs cards and walks towards 
door, jumping off platform) &quot;Orientations on the script readings go on 
forever and a day and if I miss even some of it I&#39;ll never know until 
it&#39;s too late what&#39;s expected of me.&quot; 

&quot;Hey! We&#39;re dueling here! You can&#39;t walk out!! I&#39;m winning!!&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, whatever...&quot; (thinks) &quot;...hold on...&quot; (makes a call) &quot;...you can 
duel him. He was lined up to duel the boss but the Yuri thing came up 
and that became a rewrite and a half and... well, never mind.&quot; (Tosses 
card onto card platform) &quot;I&#39;ll leave him my special card. He might get 
a use out of it.&quot; 

&quot;Who&#39;s he?!?&quot; 

&quot;Better shuffle your deck because he&#39;s coming. So move it or lose it. 
Oh,he&#39;s a normal according to the notes I got. He fancies himself a 
Mage (but never went a day to Guardian Academy so he must be a Normal 
Mage). Notes says his friends call him the DMage. So he didn&#39;t get all 
those notices about what not to talk about.&quot; 

&quot;Dammit...&quot; (pulls a fistful of cards out and works them into her deck) 
Someone enters the room. &quot;Alright. Get over to the platform and shuffle 
the deck. Here&#39;s the groundrules. It&#39;s a 50 card deck, there&#39;s 8000LP, 
whoever hits zero loses. We don&#39;t talk about other series, I don&#39;t talk 
about Nene and no talking about my sexual orientation because it&#39;s a 
no-no and Eric will have a fit. Also no bringing up my faux pas in 
Episode 3 because yes, Nene&#39;s a lesbian and so am I and we&#39;re NOT 
related so give up that stupid notion right now.&quot; 

&quot;I said brief him, not bore him!&quot; 

&quot;You going to work or what dummy?!? Sigh...&quot; (huffs her breath once) 
&quot;Let&#39;s duel. I&#39;ll go first.&quot; (looks over cards) &quot;Still think this is 
one damned creepy field...&quot;

Nina - 8000LP (Graveyard) DMage - 8000 LP (Graveyard) 

(thinks for a few seconds) &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll play one card face down 
(magic/trap field) and I&#39;ll play Witty Phantom, in Attack Mode.&quot; 

Witty Phantom (Dark/Fiend) Attack - 1400 Defense - 1300 

&quot;Alright, DM, it&#39;s your move.&quot; 

&quot;I am going to start out with cards that was given to me by my best
friend. I place one card face down in the (magic/trap field) also and 
play Sorcer of the Doomed, in attack mode.&quot; 

Sorcer of the Doomed (Dark/Fiend) Attack - 1450 Defense - 1200 

Sorcer attack Witty Phantom, destroying it from the field. 

Nina - 7950LP (Graveyard) DMage - 8000LP (Graveyard)

&quot;I really hope you weren&#39;t referring to Keiko as a friend. She&#39;s a 
fewdrumsticks shy a KFC bucket meal.&quot; (draws card) &quot;I&#39;ll play one card 
face down, in Defense mode. And to make you think I&#39;m a pushover I&#39;ll 
scar your lifepoints with Hinotama!&quot; Field erupts in flames as 
fireballs rain from the sky, scarring DMage&#39;s field, leaving pockets of 
flames about his field as the fire attack subsides.

Nina - 7900LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7500LP (Graveyard)

(suddenly Nina blushes) &quot;Aw damn! That&#39;s not what I meant to say!&quot; 
(startslaughing) &quot;Can I take that back? I didn&#39;t mean it that way!&quot; 
(waits for her cue) &quot;No? I can&#39;t? Let him move already? Alright! 
Alright.&quot; (sighs) &quot;I meant to say &#39;And so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a 
pushover&#39; dammit! Augh...&quot; (looks at DMage) &quot;Well? Your move. Don&#39;t 
want on ceremony for me.&quot; 

&quot;I play (in magic/trap) Sword of Dark Destruction increasing the 
attackpower of my Sorcerer of the Doomed to 1850 and defense is now 
1000. And to make things a little interesting I play The Stern Mystic 
exposing all monster cards that are face down.&quot; 

The Stern Mystic (Spellcaster/Effect) Attack - 1500 Defense - 1200 

&quot;no effects are triggered. I will make my attack after I reveal 
whatmonster card is on the field.&quot; 

&quot;No problem.&quot; (Nina moves to flip over her cards, but stops) &quot;One 
problem.Stern Mystic SPECIFICALLY states it has to be FLIPPED! As in I 
have to knock it over from reversed defense mode to trigger it&#39;s 
effect! Unless you know a different rule than me you can&#39;t play Stern 
Mystic without flipping it from face down to face up to trigger it&#39;s 
effect. Now, you could still wipe out my card... or you can explain why 
I should fall for that since, in past Episodes, I had to lay down my 
Stern Mystic face down in order to get the effect to kick in.Your 
move.&quot; Nina smiles slightly, her fingers drumming her board waiting for 
a reply. 

&quot;Well if that the case I will accept that I am used to playing a card 
facedown and then flipping it to get the flip effect.&quot; the DMage said 
with a grin. &quot;HAHAHA ok I understand. I response I will have the Stern 
Mystic attack that face down monster on the field.&quot; 

&quot;Bust job!!&quot; (Nina flips card over) &quot;Beaver Warrior! Total wipeout! 
Since Stern Mystic &amp; Beaver Warrior cancel each other out it&#39;s a draw! 
And since double knockout only happens when both cards are in Attack 
mode it&#39;s a Mexican standoff!&quot; (draws card) &quot;Thought I was screwed for 
a second. If you whacked me with your Sorcerer I&#39;d have been knocked 
out.&quot; (thinks) &quot;I&#39;ll tribute Beaver Warrior and play this new card face 
down, in Defense mode. Plus, I&#39;ll flip up my magic/trap card and reveal 
it&#39;s Ultimate Offering! I&#39;ll toss 500LP to play a new card... The 13th 
Grave! Which gets a spiked up field power bonus from being played on 
our Graveyard field!&quot;

The 13th Grave (Dark/Zombie) Attack - 1560 Defense - 1170

&quot;Now I&#39;ll use it to wipe out Stern Mystic! Attack!!&quot; Stern Mystic is 
destroyed 

Nina - 7400LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7940LP (Graveyard)

&quot;Not bad for a girl who looked almost screwed one move ago. Your 
move.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s just like a little hit me when I am down!!!&quot; 

&quot;If you went for my throat with Sorcerer from the word go I&#39;d be the 
one down now. But it looks like fortune smiles on everyone&#39;s favorite 
Kotobuki!&quot; 

&quot;If you think that you are going to beat me with a obvious face down 
cards and a 13th grave you must not have read the memo about one of my 
best monster cards.&quot; 

&quot;Unless you post your memos at Command Central I really didn&#39;t read 
it.&quot; 

&quot;I will leave you in suspense of a few turns and then unleash his fury 
on you. As for now I play a card face down in defense mode.&quot; 

&quot;Also I will have my powered up Sorcerer of the Doomed with her attack
strength of 1850 remove the The 13th Grave from the field.&quot; The 13th 
Grave is returned to it&#39;s grave, destroyed.

Nina - 7110LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7940LP (Graveyard)

&quot;Minor setback.&quot; (draws card, smiling as she does) &quot;...and it looks 
like fate is about to give little girl Kotobuki another favor! I 
tribute my face down monster (who didn&#39;t have the attack to cream your 
monster) and play Swordstalker! In attack mode!!&quot;

Swordstalker (Dark/Warrior) Attack - 2000 Defense - 1600

&quot;And it&#39;s attack is more than capable of mauling Sorcerer! Attack!!&quot;

&quot;Looks like you forgot about my face down card in the trap/magic.&quot;
Flips it over to reveal a trap card. &quot;I us my Trap Hole to remove your
Swordstalker from the field!!!&quot; Swordstalker is destroyed.

Nina - 7110LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7940LP (Graveyard)

&quot;Now that the field is cleared I attack with my Sorcerer of the
Doomed&quot;

Nina - 5210LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7940LP (Graveyard)

Nina grits her teeth, and draws her next card.
