<h1>The Mistress of Dragons and Cards (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../yugioh/mistress-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>These are from the private journals of Dmage filling in for the
sleeping Nina.

Nina - &quot;Whose sleeping?!?&quot; (frowns) &quot;I just finished a shoot and it
was embarrassing! Just do the Episode while I regain what little
pride I have left...(so do something for a change!) I have to rest up
from my lemon scene.&quot; (stops and looks back as she leaves) &quot;IT&#39;S HARD
WORK, ALRIGHT?!? (dammit!)&quot;

Common&#39; area Tent (May 13th, 2002) (same place as the last few
Episodes).

(Back to the Private Journals)

I looked around in my mail box and wow today was special. I got a new
cell phone in the mail today. It was from my evil older brother Mike.

Eliza - &quot;Why is he your evil older brother if he sends you cell
phones?&quot; (shrugs as DM looks at her) &quot;Sorry. Just thought to ask. Go
on. Don&#39;t mind me.&quot;

He was the one that the family broke the family savings and loan bank
open to send him to Guardian&#39;s School!

Nina - &quot;GUARDIAN SCHOOL&#39;S FREE!! All you have to do is BE DEAD to be
a Guardian!&quot;

Eliza - &quot;That&#39;s Ravens, not Guardians.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Whut?&quot;

Eliza - &quot;You&#39;d have to be dead to be a Raven, not a Guardian.&quot;

Nina - &quot;...oh...&quot; (blushes) &quot;...my bad...&quot; (lies down on couch) &quot;You
guys keep going, I&#39;m going to snooze here.&quot;

If I had my way it would be him who was just the normal mage and I
would be the real mage of the family!!!

Nina - &quot;...don&#39;t wanna hear a lwife stoney...&quot; (mumbling in a half
sleep state) &quot;...jst&#39; call &#39;im!!&quot;

But enough chit chat let&#39;s get this introduction moving... I call
Mike on the new cell phone that he gave me and tell him to get down
her at the K-mart I have a challenger for him to duel. Minutes later
he arrives at the gate and he is allowed in since he is my one friend
for the week.

&quot;I was practicing my spells and incantations for my final this had
better be good.&quot; Mike yelled.

Nina (wakes up and rolls over) &quot;Sounds like we&#39;re being had here,
Eliza.&quot;

Eliza - &quot;You don&#39;t say.&quot;

&quot;Of course it is you are going to have you chance to face the great
Nina in a duel ok the rules are simple. First you will be playing
with a 50 card deck each of you will have a different field that you
will be playing on you can change you field but not you opponents&#39;.
And last but not least you will have 8000 lps at the start of the
duel. Oh and one more thing no talking about other series or other
episodes that have already taken place ok.&quot;

&quot;Fine but this had better go quickly.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry it will.&quot; Dmage winks at him pulling a rabbit out of his
#%@ oops it got censored.

&quot;You will do anything to get attention won&#39;t you.&quot; Mike walks off and
goes to battle Nina.

&quot;This better not be you or...&quot; (Nina sits up and looks peeved) &quot;I&#39;m
going to get clearance to give you the Troopers Workout! And believe
you me, if I smell scam I&#39;m going to work you.&quot; Eliza shrugs as Nina
walks off. &quot;Never heard of that before. I know Nina was supposed to
play Trooper Venus in a Sailor Moon fan fiction story, so maybe she
means you&#39;ll have to work a Sailor Moon fiction with her? I&#39;m not
clear on the threat she made. It&#39;s a new one on me. Though for your
sake I hope there is a second duelist present. She might go through
with it (she has been rather touchy about dueling lately after losing
it seems).&quot;

Main Dueling Platform (parking lot outside of K-Mart)

Platforms slides into place.

&quot;I see somebody changed the field from Wasteland/Umi (water) to a
blank Arena field. Nice in a generic way...&quot; Nina sighs, looking over
at her new opponent. &quot;So, not to be cliche but are you a good wizard,
or a bad wizard?&quot;

&quot;Wtf I am not evil I am a nice wizard.&quot; looks at dmage and causes his
pants to catch on fire.

&quot;Wow. If (as a character) I wasn&#39;t completely lesbian I&#39;d actually
care.&quot; (picks up deck and shuffles it for abit while talking) &quot;So
what now?&quot;

&quot;Now Nina where were we. Ok you think you can play hide and seek?&quot;

Nina - &quot;?&quot; (looks about) &quot;Either your brain is frozen solid on
BlueIce or

this was written without a thought that&#39;d I just be already present
and accounted for. Either way it&#39;s not funny. Now, let&#39;s get this
going. And one thing... NEVER write for me! I can dictate my own
dialogue, thank you very much! This is MY fan fiction (check the
title at the front page and it&#39;s says Mistress of Dragons &amp; Cards)
(Now on www.shoujoai.com &lt;http://www.shoujoai.com&gt;). (shameless 
advertising sure but still.)&quot;

&quot;I thought you didn&#39;t approve of self promotion?&quot; Eliza asks.

&quot;I don&#39;t but... oh, never mind, we&#39;re going to duel or stand around
playing chitty-chatty all day!? And unless you have a protest it&#39;s
your draw so play a card and let&#39;s get this going.&quot;

Nina - 8000LP (Arena) Mike - 8000LP (Arena)

Mike draws his five cards and after a few minutes of looking at the
crappy cards in his hand he decides to play a monster face down in the 
monster area.

&quot;I play this monster face down in the monster area. Your move Nina.&quot;

&quot;Hold on... hold on...&quot; (shakes head) &quot;Still recovering from this
morning&#39;s Star Wars Episode II sugar rush (damn stuff will make you go to
the Dark Side just from the glucose overload).(Oh, for those keeping
track as Episode 9 begins it&#39;s now May 15th and Star Wars Episode II is
showing at midnight... we have to wait for either inauguration or all
parts of the Adaptation comic to become available but... never mind)&quot;
(draws cards) &quot;Yuck. My hand&#39;s worst than yours. So I&#39;m going to arm my
field with the Yami card... where&#39;s that slot... there it is...&quot; (loads
card, turning her side of the field into darkness) &quot;I&#39;ll play one card
face down in the Magic/Trap field, play The Wicked Worm Beast in Attack
mode, and have it attack your face down job.&quot;

The Wicked Worm Beast (Earth/Beast-Effect)
Attack - 1400 Defense - 0700

&quot;All I had was this...&quot;
Flips over Man-Eater Bug.

Man-Eater Bug (Earth/Beast-Effect)
Attack 400 Defense 600

&quot;That...&quot; (both creatures are destroyed) &quot;...AGGH!! I can&#39;t believe I let
you play me like that!! THAT&#39;S MY FAVORITE TRICK (feigning lameness and
letting people burn themselves on my good cards)!!&quot; Nina beats the
platform railing a few times before settling down. &quot;Alright. Alright. I&#39;m
not mad. I&#39;m in my happy place. I&#39;m in my happy place...&quot; (draws card)
&quot;...and here&#39;s my happy place all over again! I&#39;ll play this one in
Defense mode, face down...&quot; (smirks) &quot;And to teach you a lesson, I&#39;ll get
one back at you and play Hinotama, scarring your life points!&quot;

Nina - 8000LP (Yami) Mike - 7500LP (Arena)

&quot;Your move. But you better think twice before attacking me!&quot;

&quot;OK. First I draw my card...&quot; First I will play this in the magic/trap
area.&quot; Plays Soul Exchange. &quot;I think you know what that means I use your
monster to summon Summonned Skull. And just to make it fair I also play
my Field magic card Yami as well&quot;

Summoned Skull Dark/Fiend (Field Power Bonus)
Attack 3250 Defense 1560

&quot;Now Summoned Skull Direct Damage Attack!!!&quot;

Nina - 47500LP (Yami) Mike - 7500LP (Yami)

&quot;Yeah. Like I&#39;m going to be able to defend against that. After all, all I
set up in my Magic/Trap field was this lousy (and my one and only) TRAP
HOLE!&quot; (flips card) &quot;Somebody should tell you that I&#39;M the star of these
stories! ME! Dammit!!&quot; (draws card) &quot;...damn though couldn&#39;t I get
something better to work with?! Sigh...&quot; (throws card down) &quot;I&#39;ll play
Robin Williams&#39; evil twin, Witty Phantom, in Attack mode (wanted
something better!) and take a rip through YOUR life points!&quot;

Witty Phantom (Dark/Fiend)
Attack - 1820 Defense - 1690

Nina - 4750LP (Yami) Mike - 5810LP (Yami)

&quot;There. Hope the pace is quick enough for you. It&#39;s your move so feel
free to come at me if you&#39;d like. No more Trap Holes so I can&#39;t do that
no more.&quot;

&quot;LOL just because you the star does not mean that you have to win them
all!!!&quot;

&quot;Hmph. Tell me that again when you have your own Internet title! (And who
the hell are you calling &quot;LOL&quot; anyway... whatever that meant)!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll Play Fissure in the magic/trap area...&quot; (Witty Phantom is
destroyed) &quot;I also play this Reborn the Monster, and I reborn my 
Summoned Skull and attack with his field power bonus again!!!&quot;

Nina - 1500LP (Yami) Mike - 5810LP (Yami)

&quot;Hmph.&quot; (draws a card) &quot;Alright. Defense mode. I&#39;ll bide my time until I
figure out a strategy to remove Summoned Skull from the field.&quot;

&quot;Well as soon as I can get my brother to write with me instead of you I
will have my own Internet title...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll be the day. Unless it&#39;s THAT kind of Internet title it&#39;ll never
be as popular as mine.&quot; (stops for a second) &quot;...just don&#39;t tell me if
it&#39;s that kind though, I&#39;m getting nauseous just thinking about &#39;that
kind&#39;...&quot;

(Thinks to himself), &#39;He says that you are a better writer then me???
Wonder if that is true?&#39; &quot;Ok! Well, I&#39;ll play this card face down in the
monster area, and then have Summoned Skull attack you face down
monster!!!&quot; (If that is true.) &quot;Well, bye-bye monster.&quot; (puts hand on 
deck) &quot;I know the next thing might be a lemon scene... or it might be a 
screw job I drew a lousy card scene... but regardless of whatever scene it 
is... let&#39;s see!&quot; (draws card quickly and looks at it) &quot;...screw job 
scene... FOR YOU!!&quot; (throws card down on field) &quot;DARK HOLE! WIPES YOUR 
MONSTERS OFF THE FIELD!!&quot; (lays down last card in hand) &quot;And I&#39;ll throw 
down the last card in my &quot;hand&quot; too...&quot;

Hitotsu Me Giant (Earth/Beast-Warrior)
Attack - 1200 Defense - 1000

&quot;And...&quot; (stands back for dramatic effect pause) &quot;...with this combo I&#39;ve
wiped out your nice little army and put myself back in the game!!
THRASHIN&#39;!&quot;

Nina - 1500LP (Yami) Mike - 3610LP (Yami)

&quot;And if you don&#39;t like that go get your own fan fiction! Though you can&#39;t
with the people who does my fan fiction... unless you suddenly became a
girl and started going with Anzu/Tea because it&#39;s a site for lesbian
characters, duh!&quot;

&quot;Ok. Well first off I play this card... and just to make it fair I play
this card face up in attack mode.&quot;

Giant Solider of Stone (Earth/ Warrior)
Attack 1300 Defense 2000

&quot;Now Attack the Giant my Giant!!!&quot;

Nina sighs, picking up a data pad (handed off from someone off camera)
&quot;.originally mind you he mislisted Giant Soldier&#39;s attack at 1200... So
it came off as a Double Suicide. but now, as you can see, with the
correct points.&quot;

Nina - 1400LP (Yami) Mike - 3610LP (Yami)

Just as the creatures were killing each other Dmage come out of nowhere
with a package... &quot;Hey!&quot; Nina calls out, voice sounding a tad annoyed,
&quot;Adults dueling here! Go solicit for the March of Duelists elsewhere!&quot;

&quot;Hi Guys guess what just came in the Mail today... the package you boss
sold me wanna see what great card I got???&quot; Dmage smiles. Nina sighs.
&quot;Thought I had a big ego... oh, and you owe Mr. Willis one because he
paid your shipping/handling for 3-5 day service! Hah! So...&quot; (spotlight)
&quot;We&#39;d like to shamelessly thank our number one supporter of all our
reviews and supplier of all things comic because we wouldn&#39;t be able to
write reviews for Comic World News or Outcast Studios without the
tireless efforts of the gang over at Amazing Al&#39;s in San Diego. Thank you
Mr. Shawn (the man on the front lines down in the store who pulls all the
issues and sends them to the warehouse). Thank you Mr. Jon Willis (the
man who handles all the shipments and orders for us and packs us with the
latest and greatest stuff), and the rest of the hard working men &amp; women
over at Amazing Al&#39;s both in the spotlight and behind the scenes because
none of this would be possible without you. Thank you guys... paid for by
Animedom Command Central, bringing you a better product through fiction.&quot;
(pauses)

&quot;Alright. Pitch is over. Whattya get?&quot;

Opens first pack and thumbs through them... &quot;Hey. If this&#39;ll take forever
get your own review article.&quot;

&quot;Well look at what we have here! I need another one of these! It&#39;s my
good old buddy Red Eyes...&quot;

Nina moans as she leans back on the rear railings of her platform. &quot;If I
knew you&#39;d become hopelessly infatuated with yourself I&#39;d have not told
you about the box...&quot;

Dmage - &quot;And wow one the two Exodia parts that I still needed...&quot;

Opens 5 more packs and then finds. &quot;Three Horned Dragon!!! Kewl&quot; then the
last pack has &quot;2 Stop Defenses and A Pot of Greed!!! This box rocks!
Please thank your boss for me if I do not see her soon!!!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a &quot;he&quot;, dammit.&quot; Nina grumbles. &quot;Boss is a he... you know, the REAL
person your writing to... my creator, father figure, etc, etc,... why&#39;d I
bother... Makes me wish we didn&#39;t have to reimburse you the $8...&quot; DM
walks away with his great new cards in hand.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me, let me guess, he&#39;s always like that...&quot; (sighs as she
draws a card) &quot;By the by, somebody said they&#39;d make a list of their
extras so we can see if there&#39;s any cards we need.... like Wall of
Illusion, or some other good cards... anyway, guess what?&quot; (picks up deck
and pushes button) &quot;I forfeit. You win.&quot;

Jumps off platform and motions for Mike to approach her.

&quot;This is just the beginning..&quot; (motions for him to come closer) &quot;.during
the Summer we&#39;re plotting a Tournament series and inviting all Shoujoai
writers with Sailor Moon CCG decks to come against the few, the proud,
the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelists in a tournament. Sorta like the Season 1 tourney
with two star chips apiece, and lots of duelists (hopefully). Right now
we&#39;re cycling the invites through the site and waiting for entries. Duels
will begin in July, which is why there&#39;s no lemon in this episode because
next episode I&#39;m taking a break from dueling and we&#39;re running a 4-part
lemon story called &quot;Harvest Duel Moon&quot; (where I&#39;ll spend the quiet life
with Eliza up in Harvest Moon character land, and since I&#39;m lousy at
farming we&#39;ll be the new girls in town and inspire a loving lesbian
romance between a new farmer girl and an familiar ranch girl.&quot; (sighs)
&quot;.and we&#39;ll lay the groundwork for &quot;Crystal Duel Millennium War&quot; up in
Crystal Tokyo proper in July. Oh.&quot; (turns to walk away) &quot;.when helter
skelter comes down in July I&#39;d like you and DM in for the duels. Need a
strong showing on our side against whatever will come our way from the
other writers.&quot; (waves) &quot;Well, see you in July. oh, hope you don&#39;t need
your fictional side for any fan fics or stuff for awhile, because you&#39;ll
be here for awhile. forgot to tell DM that people can come in, but can&#39;t
leave until AFTER lockdown.&quot; (exits) &quot;.it&#39;ll make it easier for me to
find you for Crysal Duel Millennium War anyway! Bye!&quot;

Mike is left speechless.</pre>
