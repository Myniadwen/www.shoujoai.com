<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../yugioh/mistress-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Nina - 5260LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7240LP (Dark)

Neo the Magic Swordsman (Field Power Bonus)

Attack - 1900 Defense - 1200

&quot;Ok well I am ready to unleash the power of the magic card that has the
power to steal attack points from the dead and give them to the living.
HAHAHA.&quot; said the DMage. Grandpa looked at the Nina and winked &quot;Ok go
ahead Dmage show that women who is boss.&quot;

&quot;I use De-Spell to remove the fortification of the Mystical Elf. Then
play this in the magic area Book of Secret Arts to increase the power of
my Swordman To 2200 enough to wipe that Mystical Elf from the field.&quot;

Dmage looks at Grandpa (that is his name he is not my Grandpa), he
smiles.

Nina - 5060 (Graveyard) DMage - 7240LP (Dark)

&quot;Sheesh. One of you is bad enough, do I have to be mocked by two of you?&quot;
(sighs) &#147;Though if I had anymore strange erotic thoughts about my own
card I&#146;d have to have myself spanked.&#148; (draws a card) &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll play
this one face down in Defense mode. Sigh... running out of steam again if
I&#39;m throwing everything down in Defense mode.&quot; (looks at DMage askew)
&quot;Well get it over with. Your move.&quot;

&quot;HEY NINA!!&quot;

&quot;...?...&quot;

&quot;Hi.&quot; (Two women (one meek with blue hair and the other loud with red
hair walks in))

&quot;Hi, Rahne. Michi...&quot; (sighs) &quot;I&#39;m going to draw my card, so what do
you... get off my platform, you!!&quot; (Michi shows something to Nina) &quot;Oh,
Sergio finished page 1? Let&#39;s see...&quot; (looks it over) &quot;Nice in a
completely self serving way. You show this to Rahne? I&#39;d like the readers
too&#133; sending it after this Episode so maybe the people at Shoujoai will
put it up with this Episode. Mind you&#146;ll notice a certain young tart of a
girl playing an evil blue blooded bitch but&#133;&#147;

Michi frowns, &#147;Yeah, yeah, you played the younger me on Panels 1-3. Stop
bitching about it already!&#147; (Takes picture back) &#147;Your evil sometimes,
you know that?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure nobody will believe that when they read this.&#148;

&quot;You mean people actually waste their lives reading this?&quot;

(Nina shoves Michi aside as she tries to get a better position) &quot;Shut it.
I... HEY!!&#148; (notices her deck is missing) &#147;What the&#133; Stop rifling my
deck!&quot;(grabs it out of Michi&#39;s hand) &quot;Go rifle his deck and curse it
while your at it... and HEY!!&quot; (turns to DMage) &quot;Are you playing with
Japanese cards?!?

They didn&#39;t release Red Eyes Black Skull Dragon in American release
yet!!&quot; (huffs her breath)

&quot;Well isn&#146;t that bloody unfair.&quot;

&quot;Well, &#39;liza sends her best too. Your just jealous that you only have
small parts in Pink Panties #1 anyway. Come on, Rahne, let&#39;s go grab a
bite.&quot;

&quot;Good luck, Nina.&quot;

Nina sighs, and looks over at DMage. &quot;WHAT?!? You get to talk to Grampa
whose not your Grampa and I don&#39;t get visitors?! Go mind your cards and
move!&quot;

Draw a card. Laughs, &quot;OK then! Here&#146;s another blast from the past Change
of Heart. I chose one of you face down cards... wonder what it hides???&quot;

&quot;Trap Master. Only face down card. Like you didn&#39;t memorize that from the
last go about we played, and had to throw several moves out due to
confusion...&quot; (Nina picks up her deck as she looks over at camera.) &#147;You
see he tried to use Reborn the Monster to bring back Summoned Skull, only
none of us played Summoned Skull and he mistook my Swordstalker for
Summoned Skull. Then he tried to use Rei&#145;s special card and I blew it
away faster than you can say &#147;Jackass&#147; (as if you would) and&#133; never
mind.&#148;

(shows deck to Dmage) &quot;I&#39;m placing the cards taken out of the graveyard
because several moves had to be thrown out, and I&#39;m reshuffling my
deck...&quot; (shuffles) &quot;That way you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m playing again and
can&#39;t counter me from just looking at the cards I already laid down in
the old Episode, and would have had to been replayed again since the Red
Eyes incident. And, because I&#39;m sucking at 5000LPs, I&#39;m drawing a

full hand to counter your already powered Neo &amp; my former Trap Master.&quot;
(Looks at cards)

&quot;Damn this sucks. Not in an enjoyable sexual way but&#133; never mind&#133;&quot; (looks
over cards again)

&quot;I never get a break. I&#39;ll play one card face down, and I&#39;ll tribute
500LPs toplay Uraby, in Attack Mode, to destroy MY Trap Master which you
stole.&quot;

Uraby (Earth/Dinosaur)

Attack - 1500 Defense - 0800

Trap Master is swallowed whole by Uraby, in a rather dramatic manner.
Like a scene out of Jurassic Park, or Jurassic Park III, or something.

Nina - 4560LP (Graveyard) DMage - 6240LP (Dark)

&quot;And people think Jurassic Park is the only place to find dramatic
dinosaur munching deaths.&quot; (becomes serious) &quot;Because Trap Master was
taken, but NEVER played in Defense Mode, he gets wiped at Attack mode.
But I already know what your up to so it&#39;s not like it hurts you much...
will it? Alright...&quot; (motions) &quot;It&#39;s your move again. You have Neo and
it&#39;s powered up mode so take your shot and get it over with. I don&#39;t have
anything right now to take it out with.&quot;

&quot;Ok, sounds good. Neo give that bad girl a spanking.&quot;

&quot;...idiot...&quot;

Neo slashes Uraby to the ground, destroying it.

Nina - 3860LP (Graveyard) DMage - 6240LP (Dark)

&quot;The ONLY person around here who gets to give me a spanking is Eliza
dammit! You want some?!?&#148; (steps to side of platform, pulls down pants
and turns to show her rear, spanking it hard. &#147;YOU CAN&#146;T HAVE IT! ONLY MY
LOVER GETS TO HAVE A TASTE!! GOT&#133;&#148; (stops and looks up in shock) &#147;&#133;what
the hell am I doing?!?&#148; (quickly pulls up pants) &#147;I know this is a lemon
but REALLY!!&#148; (goes back to platform and grabs a card) &#147;Never ever again
am I having a caffeine binge before work.&#148;

(throws down a new card while picking one up) &quot;First I&#39;ll sacrifice this
face down card to play Succubus Knight, in Attack mode,&quot; (throws down two
more cards) &quot;Then I&#39;ll play TWO Legendary Swords to juice up her attack
enough to take Neo out.&quot;

Succubus Knight (Dark/Warrior)

Attack - 2250 Defense - 1900

&quot;And to set up my next move, I sacrifice 500LP to play Witty Phantom, in
Defense mode.&quot;

Witty Phantom (Dark/Fiend)

Attack - 1400 Defense - 1300

(looks over at Succubus Knight and shudders) &#147;Damn caffeine raging
through my blood.

Right now all I can think about is checking her shorts to see if that&#146;s
her natural hair color&#133; and maybe get a taste&#133; or just munch her&#133; oh
goddess I have to switch to something less potent than root beer!!&#148;

(shakes head fiercely while holding it) &#147;How the hell can people narrate
lemons without getting overwrought it so beyond me!!&#148; (sighs) &quot;Maybe
after my next move I&#146;ll seduce my own card&#133; again&#133; Now let&#39;s give that
bad boy with the big mouth a spanking of his own!

(though not in a &quot;I&#39;m interested in you&quot; kind of way, mind you. Just a
general purpose spank).&quot;

Nina - 3360LP (Graveyard) DMage - 6190LP (Dark)

Draws a card. &quot;Ok Nina, I&#146;ll play this monster face down. And this in the
magic/trap area&#133;

Remove Trap removing your Ultimate Offering from the board.&quot;

&quot;No problem...&quot; (draws card as she puts Ultimate Offering into the
graveyard pile)

&quot;Ultimate Offering was too tempting.&quot; (looks over her card) &quot;I&#39;ll tribute
Witty Phantom and bolster my forces with Rude Kaiser.&quot;

Rude Kaiser (Earth/Beast Warrior)

Attack - 1800 Defense - 1600

&#147;Now... how many monsters you have on the field face down? I vaguely
remember you having two prime targets on the field (Mystical Elf &amp; Giant
Solider of Stone). How many face downs you have, anyway? (I&#145;d remember
but I can&#145;t stop thinking about&#133;&quot; (leans back against far platform
railing and sighs, eyes in partially dreamy state) &#147;Oh goddess&#133;&#148; (looks
down as she touches Eliza&#146;s head, as the girl (dressed as the Succubus
Knight) licks her cunt fiercely and with full vigor. &#147;We gotta&#133; (sigh)
&#133;end this &#147;Graveyard&#148; duel&#133; (pant) &#133;soon. I can&#146;t take this dream&#133;&#148;
(Eliza shoves three fingers into Nina causing her legs to buckle, and
sweat to pour down her face as she grabs her breasts and starts fondling
them) &#147;&#133;goddess make it STOP!! I&#133; oh goddess don&#146;t stop&#133; don&#146;t&#133;&#148; Nina
leans against the back railing, legs spread as far as they&#146;ll go, leaving
her fully to Eliza&#146;s mercies as the girl&#146;s tempo increases and the green
haired girl rises towards orgasm.

&#147;AGH! EYYAAHH!! GODDESS &#145;LIZA!!&#148; (Eliza quickly yanks her fingers out,
clamping her mouth down tight over Nina&#146;s pussy, working her tongue
quickly into her like a small wet penis.

Nina&#146;s world dissolve in fire and bliss, her orgasm shredding her
strength and dropping her into the back railing mouth ajar and voice
wailing. Tears flow down her cheeks as she drops onto the platform
flooring gasping for breath from her own self inflicting daydream. Still
dressed, yet feeling fulfilled and as if she had her moment without Eliza
touching her (or even being present).

Nina slumps forward, resting her head against the holoboard base
connecting board to platform. She grabs her forehead and slumps sideways
rasping for breath. &#147;That&#133; bitch&#133; Michi&#133; must have&#133; jacked a&#133;
neuroprogram&#133; into my wet&#133; wetware&#133; the slut&#133;&#148; (grabs her body and holds
tight, trying to regather her wits) &#147;&#133;when I &#133; catch her&#133; I&#146;ll&#133;&#148; (sighs
as her head droops to one side) &#147;&#133;forget it&#133; probably &#145;liza&#146;s idea of a
worktime treat for me&#133; and it&#146;s too much&#133; (gasp)&#133; of a fucking hassle&#133;

to get revenge if Eliza thought&#133; rasp rasp&#133; the whole thing&#133; (whew)&#133; I&#146;ll
get Michi some other time&#133;&#148;

&quot;I have 2 face down monsters and one magic card&quot;

&quot;..wait a sec&#133;&#147; (pulls herself back onto her feet haphazardly) &#147;&#133;getting
my feet back under me again&#133;&#147; (wipes the sweat from her forehead as she
calms back down) &#147;Alright then... now I know I should have myself
examined for biting such an obvious piece of bait, but I have no choice.
I&#39;ll play it to the hilt and have my monsters each attack one face down
monster! (Succubus destroys the first which should be either Giant
Solider or Mystical Elf which wipes them since neither can defend against
an attack of 2200, and Rude Kaiser trashes the new one just in case it&#39;s
an Effect monster. ;)&quot;

&#147;Ok I flip one of the face down cards over and ... you lucked out it was
only Hane-Hane... BUT...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t stick your &quot;Butt&quot; in my face! Spit it out!&quot;

&quot;The card says I can select one card on the field regardless of position
and return it to it&#39;s owner&#39;s hand ... I choose... you guessed it
Succubus Knight.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t guess a thing so why are you so happy about? Though&#133;&#147; (sighs as
the card goes back into her hand with both Legendary Swords) &#147;No more
oral sexpot clips. Now&#133; draw your card.&#148;

Draws one card. &quot;I think I will keep this one in my hand. But I play Neo
the Magic Swordman in attack mode.&#148;

Neo the Magic Swordman (Light/ Spellcaster)

Attack 1700 Defense 1000

&#147;And also play this magic card that I had face down on the field.
Fissure. Destroying you Rude

Kaiser. Now many cards do you have face down?&#148;

A rift in the ground swallows Rude Kaiser up whole, destroying it.

&#147;None. They&#39;re all up front. And since you went and sent Succubus back in
my hand? I get my two Legendary Swords back. Thanks for not thinking of
sending Rude Kaiser (which had NOTHING attached to it) to my hand and
sending Succubus to the graveyard. Now it&#39;s my turn...&quot; (draws card)
&#147;Though thanks about Succubus too. Don&#146;t think I could have taken another
intense round with her.&#148; (looks at card)

&quot;...well FINALLY! Wondered how long we&#39;ll play in a graveyard without a
zombie card.&#148; (smiles as she waves the card in the air) &#147;And since I&#146;m
not into necrophilia I won&#146;t have any weird thoughts about this one!
Let&#146;s give it up for Dragon Zuuumbie!&quot;

Dragon Zombie (Dark/Zombie) (Field Power Bonus)

Attack - 2080 Defense - 0000

&quot;Reminder to newbies. It has no defense because it&#146;s dead, hence if I had
&#147;Call of the Haunted&#148; I could keep bringing the Dragon Zombie back to
life again and again with a power bonus each time.&#147;

(thinks for a second) &#147;And this time I&#39;m not bungling my chance to wipe
your card before you have a chance to power it up.&quot; (Clears throat)
&quot;Draggin&#39; Zuuumbie! Wipe Neo from the field with funky zuuumbie zummmbie
zuuummm...!&quot;

&quot;FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE JUST KILL IT ALREADY!!&quot;

&quot;Well I wondered how long you were going to linger in the sidelines like
that, Keiko. Hold on,&quot; (back to board) &#147;ZUUUUMMBBIIEEE BREATH!&#148; (as Neo
is destroyed Nina begins to chuckle) &#147;Nobody carries that bad accent
infliction like I do!&#148;

&#147;You can say that again.&#148;

Nina turns and looks off to the darkness at Rei. &quot;Got lost?&quot;

&quot;Days past while you two were thrashing out three episodes.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know, damn e-mail writing is slow. And verification from
Shoujoai took forever.

So, what are you doing here? Aren&#39;t you suppose to be shooting now?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you... never mind, I&#39;ll tell you next chapter after he wins. But
we have to go&#133;&quot;

&quot;Your a bundle of joy. But look!&quot;

Nina - 3360LP (Graveyard) DMage - 5810LP (Dark)

Rei looks at the points and scoffs, &quot;...your losing. Big whoop.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m dragging him down! I keep this pace up I&#39;ll win!&quot;

&quot;Not likely, but delude yourself further.&quot;

&quot;Well aren&#39;t you a bundle of joy...&quot; (turns to look) &quot;WHAT?!? YOUR MOVE!
Don&#146;t just stand there taking up valuable space! MOVE!!&#148;

Looks at the card... &quot;Crap I used that card a min a go I can&#39;t use it
again... hmmm ok I place this card face down in defense mode. and
go...wtf? opps I sent it too soon.&quot;

&#147;Now what?! I...&quot; (looks over at Keiko for a second) &quot;...pick up the card
and pick something else... I&#39;ll be right back...&quot; (pushes a button,
waiting a few seconds as the board scans her cards and positions, before
she jumps off platform with deck in hand) &quot;AND DON&#39;T TOUCH MY CARD
SETTINGS!!&quot;

(walks out with Keiko)

Now what was that all about?

&#147;Did you tell him about Lockdown?&#148; Rei asks.

&#147;Nah. By the time he figures it out I&#146;ll be safely away waiting for the
inauguration of Spider-Man and Star Wars Episode II and he&#146;ll have to go
home. Not the win I was hoping for, but better than a lost.&#148;
