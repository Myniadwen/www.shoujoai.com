<h1>M. Valentine</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/taryn.html">Taryn</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a cold, chilly, winters night. The snow was coming down in soft, 
thick blankets. It wasn&#39;t a blizzard like the weatherman said it would 
be but something more along the lines of a continuous drift. 

You&#39;d have to be either crazy or dead to be walking in that weather, 
Mai sighs. How was she supposed to know this would happen? At first she 
only thought of Joey, Tristan and their skizty friend Yumi or Yugi... 
whatever. Joey was a jerk, yes. But he also had a sensitive side, even 
if he&#39;d be the last to admit it. Joey was always so proud of his baby 
sister...

Only she wasn&#39;t a baby.

And then there was T&eacute;a. 

Mai Valentine closed her eyes and sighed. &quot;What&#39;s going on with me?&quot; 
She muttered into the empty room. She was so used to being alone and 
preferred to be until recently. Now it seemed like she had people 
around her all the time. She was beginning o feel crowded; even in her 
own house.

&quot;Mai?&quot;

Mai groans. She takes out her deck and starts setting out. &quot;Hurry in, 
Bakura, you&#39;re letting the cold in.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right.&quot; Bakura steps in and closes the door. He slides off his 
boots and sheds his coat, gloves and scarf. &quot;I knocked but I guess you 
didn&#39;t hear me.&quot; He walks further into Mai&#39;s room and notes the tea 
set. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t mind if I had any, would you? It&#39;s pretty cold out.&quot;

&quot;Help yourself.&quot; God she sounded bitchy, Mai winced but didn&#39;t bother 
to apologize. Out of the corner of her eye she watches Bakura pour out 
two cups. 

&quot;Would you like anything in it?&quot;

&quot;In tea?&quot; Mai laughs. She shakes her head and snatches up the cup. &quot;No 
thanks. I like it like this.&quot; She lifts it to her lips and looks back 
at her deck, spread across the table, considering. They were all women, 
Mai knew. Strong and beautiful women. Amazons never depended on a man. 
They were their own and worked together.

&quot;So what are you doing with your deck?&quot;

&quot;Nothing really.&quot; Mai shrugs. She sets her teacup down to cool and 
sighs. Bakura was another skitzy person. She often wondered if everyone 
claims to be possessed by ancient spirits or something. &quot;So did you 
come just for the tea?&quot;

&quot;Actually no.&quot; Bakura pours himself another cup, needing something to 
do with his hands. 

&quot;Then what is it, Bakura?&quot; She was becoming impatient. Mai picks up her 
harpy lady card and just looked. They made a male harpy, she thought 
bitterly. She puts the card down and picks up another. &quot;Surely your not 
here just for the company.&quot; She casts Bakura an impish smile. He starts 
choking on his tea, giving Mai another reason to roll her eyes.

&quot;I just wanted to talk to someone and I didn&#39;t know who else to go to.&quot; 
Bakura sets down his cup and looks away. A bright blush colours his 
cheeks as he tugs at his suddenly tight collar. &quot;Is it getting hot in 
here?&quot; He asks nervously.

&quot;I&#39;ll open a window if you&#39;d like but I&#39;m pretty sure that others will 
take that as an invitation.&quot; Mai forced herself to smile kindly at him 
and reach over to pat his knee. &quot;I&#39;m touched that you&#39;d come see be 
Bakura. I&#39;ll listen and do anything...&quot; Her smile wanes. &quot;Almost 
anything to help.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Bakura sighs and pats her hand. She lays her cards back 
down and sits back. &quot;Well... I kind of... I&#39;m... that is...&quot;

&quot;Spit it out Bakura.&quot; Mai laughs. She scoots closer and loosens 
Bakura&#39;s collar herself. It was an innocent move than seemed to calm 
him down enough. &quot;Let me play big sister, Baku. At least for now.&quot;

She&#39;s always been alone, Bakura remembered suddenly and felt his heart 
warm to her. &quot;Mai... I&#39;m gay.&quot; He blurted out suddenly. He watches 
Mai&#39;s face go blank and stands, deliberately moving out of her reach. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been gay as long as I can remember and I really... that is...&quot; he 
trails off uncertainly and turns back around. 

&quot;Just say it, Baku.&quot; Mai laughs hesitantly and stands. She walks around 
the table and takes Bakura&#39;s hands in her own. &quot;I&#39;m alright with that, 
if you are.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just...&quot; He looks down at their joined hands a moment then up 
into her blue eyes. Don&#39;t hate me, his eyes begged. &quot;I like Joey.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Mai blinks and keeps his hands firmly in hers. She leans a 
little closer and looks him in the eye conspicuously. &quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; He clears his throat.

&quot;Well...&quot; Mai says thoughtfully. &quot;I guess he is kind of cute in that 
puppy costume.&quot; They both smile at that image. Mai starts laughing and 
pulls Bakura in a headlock. &quot;But I&#39;d have thought Tristan was more to 
your type.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s more for Malik&#39;s type.&quot; Bakura jokes. He playfully wraps his arms 
around Mai&#39;s waist and in an easy move; he throws her over his 
shoulder. 

&quot;Ryou!&quot; Mai squeals. She buts him in the head and manages to get onto 
her feet. Playfully, she pushes him onto the couch and sits on his lap. 
&quot;Joey Wheeler, huh?&quot; Mai says slowly. She frowns at her cards on the 
table thoughtfully. &quot;If he breaks your heart...&quot; She trails off 
ominously.

&quot;I haven&#39;t even told him yet.&quot; Bakura starts laughing. Comfortable, he 
rests his head on top of hers. &quot;I&#39;m not even sure how he&#39;ll take it if 
I tell him. He&#39;s always had a soft spot for you, Mai.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s a guy.&quot; Mai says simply. Together, they both eye her cards. What 
are they truly capable of? Mai wondered. A soft, hesitant knock could 
be heard on the door. &quot;I&#39;ll get it.&quot; Mai murmurs. She gets up 
reluctantly and crosses the room. She opens the door, reaches out and 
jerks the visitor in and slams it shut before too much cold could get 
in. &quot;Oh.&quot; Mai blinks. Her gaze wanders over to Bakura. &quot;Joey.&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh...&quot; Bakura stands up and hastily fixes his collar. &quot;Joey. 
Hello.&quot;

&quot;Bakura.&quot; Joey frowns. If he heard correctly... Joey crosses the room 
and pushes him onto the couch. He shoots Mai a look before she could do 
anything. &quot;I want you to leave us, Mai.&quot;

&quot;Bakura?&quot; Mai asks. At his calming smile, Mai relented. &quot;You hurt him 
Wheeler and I swear to god I&#39;ll break your neck.&quot; She threatens. In one 
quick sweep, she scooped up her cards and was out of the room storming 
through the yard. A sharp chill had Mai running to the next guesthouse, 
cursing all the way; her earlier thoughts running through her mind; 
you&#39;d have to be either crazy or dead to be walking in that weather.

Swearing rather boldly, Mai knocked on the door. More like banged on 
it. Another colourful phrase slipped through her lips as she reached 
for the knob. She opened the door, jumped in and slammed it shut behind 
her.

&quot;Bloody weather.&quot; She curses loudly and kicks it with her bare foot. 
She yelps again and starts hopping around on one foot. Her cards 
scatter across the floor and she says something in another language. 
With a delicate care, Mai lowered herself to the floor and began to 
pick up her cards, one by one and inspecting each one thoroughly and 
apologizing.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t really look like you want help.&quot; T&eacute;a states smugly. She 
walks over and kneels down, helping Mai with it anyway. Using the same 
care as the blond, she stacks them neatly and stands. She hands them 
over to Mai and smiles. &quot;What were you doing outside dressed like 
this?&quot; She motions to the white bodice, purple skirt and bare legs.  

&quot;Forgot my keys in the house.&quot; Mai shrugs. She walks over to the table 
without invitation and starts setting out her cards again. Damn... 
sorry &#145;bout that ladies. I was kind of in a hurry.

&quot;Would you like some tea?&quot; T&eacute;a asks. When she shook her head, T&eacute;a 
grabbed the blanket she was using and draped it over Mai&#39;s shoulders. 
Doing so, she got a look at the cards. &quot;I&#39;ve always admired your deck, 
Mai.&quot; T&eacute;a informs companionably. &quot;Serenity pretty much said the same.&quot;

&quot;Serenity?&quot; Mai repeats slowly. She sets out her cards, watching, for a 
moment before she turned to face T&eacute;a. &quot;That&#39;s what she said?&quot;

&quot;Serenity&#39;s a lovely young woman.&quot; T&eacute;a says slowly. &quot;She&#39;s said a lot 
of great things about you.&quot;

&quot;Ditto.&quot; Mai sits back and picks up a cup. Not really caring, she 
brings it to her lips. She feels T&eacute;a tense beside her and lifts a brow. 
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;I-if you want a drink...&quot; T&eacute;a smiles warily, eyeing the cup with a 
tautness that made Mai want to drag it out just that much longer. &quot;I 
could make you some tea, or get you a soda, a glass of water, or even-&quot;

&quot;Hn.&quot; Mai grinned and brought the cup back to her lips. She tilts her 
head back and sips. She stops and blinks. &quot;What exactly are you doing, 
drinking champagne?&quot; She looks over to see T&eacute;a blush. Mai raises an 
eyebrow. &quot;Is this like you doing that waitress shindig so you could be 
a dancer?&quot; T&eacute;a&#39;s blush only deepens. &quot;I see.&quot; Mai clucked her tongue 
and eyed the cup. She looks up at the younger brunette, a plea in her 
eyes. &quot;Pour me another?&quot; 

&quot;Another.&quot; Mai nods and hurries to serve. She comes back only moments 
later with another cup and the bottle. After a few moments, she had to 
know. At least ask. &quot;How&#39;d you know I took a job? Or even that I 
danced?&quot;

Mai looks over at T&eacute;a, considering her in the very same way she did her 
cards. Her ladies, Mai remembered and averted her eyes back to the 
fire. &quot;I was on my way to another tournament when I stopped for a 
break.&quot; Mai didn&#39;t bother to mention that the sight of her in that 
frilly pink dress with an apron made her want to laugh or go weak in 
the knees. &quot;Someone else served me at the time and was able to watch 
you blow up on a few customers.&quot; A small smile teased Mai&#39;s lips as she 
thought back about it. 

She doesn&#39;t know that was Yugi and Joey? T&eacute;a thought, a small amount of 
confusion setting in. She sips from her cup and motions Mai to 
continue. 

With a shake of her head, she does. &quot;I don&#39;t remember what you said 
exactly but I had this ridiculous image of you in a tutu prancing 
around like Bambi in the fields.&quot; Funny she&#39;d remembered that and not 
what she said, Mai mused. She sips from her drink again and turns back 
to T&eacute;a. &quot;I got another job while I doing the tourney. A waitress.&quot; Mai 
laughed. T&eacute;a found it oddly infective and found herself laughing too. 
&quot;A while after the tourney, I was still holding the job, doing odd 
duels whenever I could, earning a couple bucks from the sidelines and 
trying to dodge ho-uh... men.&quot; Mai decides. &quot;So this one day I hear 
we&#39;re having this dance class on stage. Seemed to me that only rich 
people could do that. Some type of fund.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m 
serving drinks when this one guy starts yelling. I saw the bouncers and 
all but I never liked his attitude so I took him out myself. Boss fired 
me that night. Gave me a couple hundred but... I&#39;m jumping ahead.&quot;

She remembered that, T&eacute;a realized. She remembered hearing some ruckus 
from the crowd and she remembered the fear that there&#39;ll be some type 
of fight. Susan told her later that a couple of men had a little too 
much to drink and tried getting a little too close.

&quot;While I was serving,&quot; Mai held up her cup, which should really be a 
flute, she thought absently. But the china was nice. &quot;It was champagne, 
near the front and I saw this beau-uh... you poking out from behind the 
curtain.&quot; Beautiful? Mai smiled and looked over at T&eacute;a. Well she&#39;d be 
lying if she said otherwise. Mai poured herself another cup and sipped. 
&quot;I watched you and the others dance.&quot; She sighed. 

T&eacute;a was touched, to say the least, and a little disconcerted that Mai 
had seen her dance. &quot;What did you think?&quot; T&eacute;a asked tentatively.

&quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot; Mai replied honestly. &quot;I couldn&#39;t. Seeing you all up 
there...&quot; Mai laughs softly and turns back to T&eacute;a. &quot;It was amazing, 
breathtaking and even had me week in the knees if I recall. The boss 
told me that I was crying at-&quot; Mai shifted and cleared her throat. She 
looks back at her cup and takes a longer drink. &quot;At one point.&quot; She 
concluded. &quot;But like I said, he fired me that night so I packed up and 
left. Heard there was a new tourney happening on some island. Invite 
only.&quot; Mai shrugged. &quot;So I had to get invited. A while later I met you 
and the others on Duelist Kingdom.&quot; And I still got weak in the knees; 
Mai remembered with some regret that she had gotten all cocky and stiff 
necked over it too. &quot;I&#39;m a vain person, Gardner. Selfish and vain.&quot;

&quot;You sent roses after the performance.&quot; T&eacute;a remembered, still lost in 
that day so long ago. It had been signed M. Valentine. One specific 
rose was addressed to a &#145;Miss Gardner, the one who could dance with 
angles.&#39; T&eacute;a&#39;s eyes became as uncertain as Mai&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;re Mr. 
Valentine.&quot; She blurted out. They both started laughing at that.

&quot;Obviously, I&#39;m no Mister.&quot; Mai laughed. She took another sip before 
setting it on the table. &quot;The white rose licked with red was meant for 
you. Did you get it?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; T&eacute;a blushed. All the dancers had fantasized about Mr. Valentine. 
She wondered what they&#39;d say if they found out he was a she. &quot;I even 
have it pressed back home.&quot; T&eacute;a admits sheepishly. Mai chuckles.

&quot;That&#39;s really sweet.&quot; Mai says. She wondered if T&eacute;a still danced but 
for some reason she was afraid to ask. She remembered how happy she 
was... did she really just give it up to go cheer Yugi on in Duelist 
Kingdom? And now this tourney Kaiba set up? Mai looks back at T&eacute;a and 
just... looks. Would she really just give something up like that? I 
guess I could understand her going to the facedown with Pegasus because 
Yugi&#39;s grandpa was at risk. But what about now?

&quot;What is it Mai?&quot; T&eacute;a asks nervously. She straightens a bit and lowers 
her cup. Mai unexpectedly reaches over and places her hand on T&eacute;a&#39;s 
cheek, turning her a little so they&#39;re face to face.

&quot;You enjoy dancing?&quot; Mai stated seriously. How could she not? At T&eacute;a&#39;s 
tentative nod, Mai cursed herself again and then cursed T&eacute;a. &quot;Why&#39;d you 
stop?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; T&eacute;a trails off uncertainly. She wondered if Mai would 
understand her reasons. She wondered if she understood them herself. 
&quot;Because of Yugi and his grandpa. Then there was Joey and his baby 
sister.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s not a baby anymore.&quot; Mai muttered, half to herself. With a shake 
of her head, she turns her attention back to T&eacute;a. &quot;The first time,&quot; Mai 
held up a finger with her other hand. &quot;The first time, I could 
understand, Gardner. And the second, I could when and if you found out 
one of your friends were trouble but what about before that? Before you 
found out about Malik and his goons?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Don&#39;t know, T&eacute;a admitted. True she missed dancing but... &quot;You 
come from a rich family, Valentine. Why would you be holding odd jobs 
and hitch hiking to the next tourney?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve no one to depend on but myself.&quot; Mai says coolly. She retracts 
her hand and stands up. She walks over to the fireplace, keeping the 
blanket T&eacute;a wrapped around her. &quot;I&#39;ve been alone, Gardner, most of my 
life with no one but detached servants. Yes, my parents loved me 
but...&quot; But what? Mai thought. What could she say to make T&eacute;a 
understand? Knowing T&eacute;a, she&#39;d probably- Mai shakes her head and turns 
back to watch the younger brunette. 

&quot;Your parents loved you.&quot; T&eacute;a says slowly. She looks back down at Mai&#39;s 
deck spread across the cards. Independence, pride, unity, and strength. 
That&#39;s what she thought when she looked at Mai&#39;s cards. She remembered 
Mai saying something about how the Harpy ladies were her only friends 
before she met them. She remembered what if felt like to dance. She 
remembered the dreams she had as she held the rose. &quot;I&#39;ll go back to 
dancing.&quot; She decided suddenly. She looks up to see Mai&#39;s surprised 
look and smiles hesitantly. &quot;I guess I needed to know who M. Valentine 
was and knew you&#39;d be at the tourney.&quot; T&eacute;a stands up and walks over to 
the fireplace, on the other side of Mai. &quot;I guess I needed to find out 
who you were before I could really do anything. I&#39;ve tried dancing 
after that but I just couldn&#39;t hack it.&quot; She couldn&#39;t get that rose out 
of her mind. She remembered reading a poem about something like that. 
How a red rose was passion, a white one for innocence...

&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be a dream.&quot; Mai whispers softly. She closes her 
eyes and tries, desperately to clear her mind of the images. When she 
opened them again, she found herself staring into T&eacute;a&#39;s baffled blue 
eyes. &quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be a dream, T&eacute;a.&quot; Mai repeats again. With one 
hand resting on T&eacute;a&#39;s waist, she brings the other up to cup her cheek. 
She strokes it gently. &quot;You could dance and I&#39;ll watch you.&quot; Swallowing 
the lump that has suddenly formed in her throat, Mai leans closer, 
keeping her lips just a breath away from T&eacute;a&#39;s. Beneath her hands, she 
could feel a suppressed shudder.

&quot;As a friend, &quot; T&eacute;a murmurs. &quot;Or as a lover?&quot; With eyes already half 
closed, she watched the heat simmer in Mai&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;That&#39;s up to you T&eacute;a.&quot; She states. Mai regretfully straightened but 
kept her hands where they were. Fighting back her nerves, Mai kept her 
eyes on T&eacute;a&#39;s. &quot;Be my girlfriend, T&eacute;a?&quot; Her fingers tense nervously and 
she tries to relax them. &quot;You know me and my faults and I can assure 
you there are more but I could...&quot; Mai sighs. What she couldn&#39;t do was 
think clearly. She was in a near panic and for quite a stupid reason. 
One look at T&eacute;a changed her mind. She could never be a stupid reason. 
Summoning the courage from the cards and herself, Mai pulls T&eacute;a close. 
&quot;Be my girlfriend, T&eacute;a, and I promise you I&#39;ll do anything and 
everything to make you happy.&quot;

&quot;What about your happiness?&quot; T&eacute;a asked softly. She felt it- It? 
Something. Something forming in the pit of her stomach, tickling the 
back of her throat and it was beginning to make her light-headed and 
dizzy, like the world was tilting.

&quot;Other than a few cosmetics...&quot; Mai jokes nervously. She hadn&#39;t meant 
to draw it out like this. She had decided that if and when she told 
T&eacute;a, it would be quick and simple. &quot;You make me happy, T&eacute;a. And seeing 
you happy only adds to it. Be my girlfriend and I&#39;ll do my best to keep 
you happy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m already happy.&quot; T&eacute;a smiled. She cups Mai&#39;s face between her hands 
and drags her down for a kiss. The first was all passion and heat. The 
second was persuasive and soft. The third was desperate and restrained.

Mai pulls back and gasps for whatever air she could find. She found it 
odd that she needed T&eacute;a&#39;s taste more than air. That was her warning to 
back away. &quot;Wow.&quot; Mai laughs breathlessly. She runs a hand over her 
face and through her hair. My ladies, Mai thought foolishly, watching 
T&eacute;a trying to regain her composure.

&quot;Wow.&quot; She agrees. T&eacute;a steps back into Mai&#39;s arms but this time, only 
holds her. She rests her head on Mai&#39;s chest and listens to the rapid 
heartbeat. I did that, T&eacute;a thought giddily. I made her heart beat 
faster.

Her pulse jumped, along with her heart when T&eacute;a did that. Mai 
tentatively wraps her arms around her girlfriend and smiles. &quot;You know, 
I&#39;d like a rematch.&quot; T&eacute;a pulls back a little to look up in Mai&#39;s face. 
&quot;I went easy on you back at the Duelist Kingdom.&quot;

&quot;Really.&quot; T&eacute;a grins. She brushes her lips over Mai&#39;s collarbone. &quot;Will 
you go easy on me now?&quot; All she could do was laugh when Mai took her in 
her arms, again, with the knowledge and mutual feelings of love, 
blossoming from the bud of friendship.


Just to let you know, it didn&#39;t work out between Joey and Bakura.

Just for the hell of it, lessay Baku fell for Yami-

Stop. We&#39;ve no time to be confused and this is Shoujo ai not Shounen, 
Shoujo. I&#39;m telling readers that we did this during class time so it 
may seem a little rushed. 

You like? Good. You don&#39;t? You can-

Read our next story. Don&#39;t know what it is or what it will be about but 
it will be there. Here. Whatever.
