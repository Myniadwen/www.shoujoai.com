	-Bon Jovi, &quot;Livin&#39; On A Prayer&quot;

It was so soft, Kawai Shizuka thought, running her fingers through the 
blonde hair of Kujaku Mai. The young girl smiled as she slowly slid her 
fingers down the side of Mai&#39;s face. The blonde woman had such warm and 
smooth skin, Shizuka noticed.

Mai had been in a sort of coma for a while now, all because of Malik 
Ishtar and that unusual golden rod of his. Shizuka had been told that 
when Malik was defeated, Mai would awaken. She prayed with all her might 
that was true.

Shizuka thought about what had happened with her older brother, 
Jounouchi Katsuya. He had almost ended up in the same condition as Mai. 
When he had recovered from his great loss, Shizuka had been overjoyed. 
She didn&#39;t want anyone else&#39;s minds to be lost forever. Still, neither 
she nor Jounouchi would truly be happy until Mai returned to them.

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Shizuka said aloud as she traced Mai&#39;s chin. 
&quot;Would you wake up with a kiss?&quot; She chuckled at the thought. Maybe 
Jounouchi could be the one to wake Mai. However, that didn&#39;t feel right 
to the young girl for some unknown reason.

Shizuka&#39;s hand moved down from Mai&#39;s face to her collarbone, near her 
chest. With her other hand, Shizuka slid the blankets down so that the 
tops of them were on Mai&#39;s stomach. The mature woman&#39;s body was so 
slender, so lovely. The brunette let out a sigh of envy. How much she 
wished for a perfect body like Mai&#39;s!

&quot;I wonder if you realize how beautiful you really are?&quot; Shizuka asked 
the unconscious Mai. &quot;I&#39;m sure my brother does, and I know I do.&quot; Her 
eyes traveled down from Mai&#39;s face to her breasts. They were large and 
firm, and her white bustier revealed much cleavage. Unknowingly, Shizuka 
was moving her hand closer to Mai&#39;s breasts.

When Shizuka realized what she was doing, she immediately pulled her 
hand back. What was she thinking? It was true that she was attracted 
toward Mai&#39;s breasts, but it was rude to touch another woman&#39;s chest 
without permission!

Still, it was so difficult to resist that desire. Mai was so beautiful, 
and Shizuka longed to feel that beauty with her own hands. That soft 
hair, that warm skin, that fine bosom&#133; Shizuka found every inch of Mai&#39;s 
body to be absolutely gorgeous.

Hesitatively, Shizuka gently traced Mai&#39;s lips. They were bright, and 
they felt nice to the young girl&#39;s fingertips. She wondered what it 
would taste like if she were to kiss Mai. The desire to find out was 
even stronger than her desire to feel the woman&#39;s breasts.

Shizuka laid her hand over her heart. It was beating so wildly. She 
should&#39;ve asked herself why she was so attracted toward another woman, 
but she really didn&#39;t care why. It just mattered that she was.

Lightly, she touched the side of the buxom woman&#39;s face, feeling the 
blonde curls against her fingers. Everyday she prayed for Mai&#39;s 
recovery, and she strongly believed that her prayers were not in vain. 
Mai would open her violet eyes, and then she would see Shizuka right at 
her bedside.

The brunette smiled at the thought. Her prayers gave her the courage to 
stay by Mai&#39;s side. She would never give up on the older woman, no 
matter what. If you prayed hard enough, she believed, then anything was 
possible.

&quot;Wake up soon, please,&quot; Shizuka requested in a soft tone. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
if I can wait to get your permission any longer.&quot; Little by little, she 
bent over Mai, and pressed her lips against the blonde&#39;s. Her kiss 
lasted for almost a minute, and nothing else mattered to her in that 
minute except for the kiss. Finally, she pulled her lips back, but she 
did sneak a quick glance at Mai&#39;s cleavage before straightening her 
back.

Shizuka took Mai&#39;s hand into hers and held it to her chest, near her 
heart. &quot;Your lips were very sweet,&quot; she complimented, her voice almost a 
whisper. &quot;I hope you thought my lips were just as sweet.&quot; She squeezed 
Mai&#39;s hand just a little tighter as she continued to pray with all her 
heart and soul.
