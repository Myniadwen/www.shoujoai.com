<pre>11:14 PM

The island of Duelist Kingdom, just off the coast of Domino, Japan

&quot;Wake up princess... oh miss kujaku...&quot;

Mai&#39;s eyes fluttered open, awakening her to the present darkness.

Groggily, she stood up, rubbing her pounding head. Eyes adjusting to 
the night, she looked around, only to realize herself positioned on a 
dueling platform.

&quot;Hey, whats going on?! A minute ago I was walking back to camp...&quot;

&quot;Thought you might want to take the chance to show your pathetic 
skills to a REAL duelist,&quot; taunted a voice nearby.

&quot;Too bad I&#39;ve already seen myself play,&quot; mai smirked.

&quot;Hehehe..cute.. Perhaps you&#39;d like to put your star-chips where your 
mouth is! they do call me the player killer, after all.&quot;

Mai threw down eight stars.&quot;if you think you&#39;re so tough then lets get 
it on!&quot; she shouted, incensed.

&lt;Heh heh heh... sooner than you think, little birdy...&gt; thought 
Pegasus, watching the live feed.

&quot;DUEL!&quot;

Mai-2000/PK-2000

&quot;First i&#39;ll summon my harpie lady, in attack mode!&quot; announced mai, the 
sky demoness rising from the board with a screech of fury. Then-

FWOOOOOSH! Twin jets of flame seared the air around Mai, causing her 
to scream.

&quot;Oh, i&#39;m sorry, did that scare you? Of course i probably should have 
mentioned this, but fear is my favorite tactic to use on my opponents- 
something about the way they squirm...&quot;

Mai chuckled, &quot;Oh, I wasn&#39;t scared, just startled a bit.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; 

FWOOOOOOOOSH! the jets rose dramatically again, but this time there 
was no fear in the girl&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Hmm... well, perhaps a different strategy. let me see...&quot; The player 
killer looked down at his custom dueling board as words seemed to jump 
to the air. &quot;A file listing psychological profiles for every duelist 
on the island... such a nice bonus from Pegasus-sama... now what have 
we here?&quot; A grin spread across the Player Killer&#39;s face, &quot;Oh, this 
will be fun...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll play two more cards face down, and its your move, loser!&quot;

The Eliminator looked up from his data file and smiled tauntingly. 
&quot;All right then, i&#39;ll summon copycat, to mimic your lady! your turn.&quot;

Mai stared at his monster- it looked as if- but no... yes! it was! 
strangely enough, the fake harpie was looking staight at her... with 
bedroom eyes?

As Mai drew her card she scarcely noticed what it was, distacted by 
the intense stare of the copycat harpie. she noticed her cheeks 
reddening. &lt;Relax,&gt; she thought, &lt;Its probably just a glitch in the 
hologram, i mean it&#39;s a female monster, after all&gt; &quot;I activate my face 
down card: rose whip! Now my harpie is 400 points stronger than yours! 
Attack!&quot; Mai&#39;s monster lashed it&#39;s opponent, tearing it apart.

Mai-2000/PK-1600

The hulking man just laughs,&quot;I think it&#39;s time to up the ante...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m already wagering all my stars!&quot;

&quot;Not quite what I meant- Go! Black Magician Girl!&quot; the monster 
(monstette?) takes form, giving mai a nonchalant look, totally unlike 
the copycat&#39;s stare. The blonde begins to relax, seeing that the 
come-hither look had been a fluke after all.

&quot;And I&#39;ll combine it with this magic card,&quot; adds the Player 
Killer,&quot;it&#39;s a very rare one, specially designed by Mr. Crawford to 
spice up this duel... Ecchi Spirit!&quot;

Suddenly the magess begins to quiver, as if in a cold wind. Her eyes 
roll into her head and she stiffens momentarily, before falling limp 
and collapsing to the field.

&quot;Ecchi Spirit has some very interestig side effects, as you&#39;ll soon 
discover...&quot;

The beautiful spellcaster stired, and rose, her gaze peircing Mai&#39;s 
eyes, heart and very soul. The look was so intense that Mai, though 
fully clothed, felt naked and bare. She barely noticed that her 
opponent was still talking...

&quot;...It causes the monster to take quite an interest in the human 
player facing it, rather than the other creatures on the field...&quot;

...The image of the card leapt upwards landing on Mai&#39;s platform...

&quot;...The monster often forgets it&#39;s still dueling...&quot;

...The girl closed in on Mai, rapidly invading her personal space, 
staring into the player&#39;s terrified eyes with a fervor of ardent 
lust...

&quot;...And pursues other objectives...&quot;

...As the magician&#39;s hand stroked Mai&#39;s inner thigh, sliding her hand 
under her skirt, Mai tried to scream, but couldn&#39;t, her throat 
closing, her head swimming...

&quot;...Of course she probably doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re a homophobe, nor cares 
, i imagine...&quot;

... Mai yelped as the card yanked down her panties and clamped her 
mouth over the duelist&#39;s womanhood, then began stroking her nether 
lips with a stong tongue, while suckling Mai&#39;s clit with her upper 
lip...

&quot;...Of couse, you really can&#39;t blame me, i&#39;m doing you a favor, 
helping you overcome your fear...heheh, get it, come...&quot;

...Mai began to shake, the adrenaline high of fear mixing with the 
intense pleasure, she felt her body giving in...

&quot;...Of, course you can always surrender, the hologram will dissapear, 
and you will be free to go...home that is...&quot;

...Mai began convulsing, thrusting her hips, grinding her slit into 
the mage&#39;s mouth, when...

&quot;...If you want it to stop, all you have to do it give in to your 
fear...and scream. just scream, and it ends...&quot;

...Suddenly the girl stopped sucking, leaped up, and pushed Mai to the 
metal floor. Mai gasped, trying to contain herself, 
&quot;please...more...don&#39;t stop...&quot; at this the monster tore off her own 
panties and slammed into Mai, their orchids rubbing together 
frenziedly, sending Mai into ecstasy...

&quot;... Just scream in fear, and I&#39;ll call her off, I know you can&#39;t be 
enjoying this, what with your phobia, and all. Besides, its only a 
game, heheheh...&quot;

...Mai and the spell-weilder had grabbed eachother&#39;s legs, and were 
pulling themselves together, relishing the waves of heat washing thru 
them...

&quot;...As entertaining as it is to watch this little show, i do have a 
schedule, so if you intend to forfiet i&#39;ll give you to the count of 
three...&quot;

...Mai could fell her body tensing, her muscles rippling, it was too 
much...

&quot;...One...&quot;

...the card slid off and in one motion reared like a cobra and struck, 
biting down on Mai&#39;s flower...

&quot;...Two...&quot;

...Mai&#39;s world stopped. all was silent. the only noise in her head was 
a distant roar, as though a massive wave rushing to meet the beach...

&quot;...Three...&quot;

...Mai threw back her head and bellowed into the night. All her prior 
fear and pain gone- there was only now, only here, only this. All else 
was faux to this moment. A moment of unmistakable power.

Unbelievable pleasure.

Undeniable love.

The player killer laughed heartily as the holograms faded, &quot;Well, 
that&#39;s that, I guess I win!&quot;

suddenly reality hit Mai like a truck, knocking her breath away. &quot;I... 
I lost...?&quot;

Her mind raced as she stood up, pulling on her panties. But no, there 
was no arguing, the judging AI built into the platform had declared 
it&#39;s winner...

&quot;Mai! what&#39;s wrong? are you okay?&quot; Yelled a familiar young voice.

And the rest, as they say, is history.
