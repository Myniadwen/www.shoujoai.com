<h1>Wildcardz (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>From the Journal of Nina Kotobuki (June 14th, 2002)

&quot;Damn... it&#39;s been 5 days now since the failed attempt to put a Movie
#153 in the books and the board hasn&#39;t been the same since. The
monitoring board which keeps track of new movies has been flashing &quot;? ? ?
?&quot; ever since, and nobody seems to know what&#39;ll be next, or when it&#39;ll
be. Sigh. Maybe I should focus on something less worrisome than that
before I start to go nuts... anyway, it&#39;s been a spell since I took my
harsh beating at the hands of the Brothers Lutkie. I&#39;d like to say I&#39;ve
been plotting my sweet revenge, but I&#39;ve been more into wanting to do my
own storylines which unfortunately haven&#39;t gotten anywhere. Not enough
interest was shown to even think of doing a Crystal Duel Millennium
storyline... how boring! Just as well, I suppose. ever since DAG went on
hiatus I&#39;ve been handling a bunch of Specials for it and that&#39;s kept me
busier than normal. But as for those losses? Well, ever since then I
guess I always wanted to get back at the two for the defeat... maybe. Of
course I SUPPOSE they&#39;ve been having growth spurts as Duelists since
then, and I&#39;ve been getting stagnant since my last duel. Working too much
on DAG Specials to really do any real practicing. Then a bit of news
comes my way recently. Somebody from Prince Kuhio mall (Hilo Sector) told
me Dmage&#39;s deck has been modified now that he has all of cards he wanted
(see Mistress (original series) Episode 8) and he&#39;s rarin&#39; to go lookin&#39;
for a person to test his new deck on. Yeah. Nobody&#39;s been going near him.
Half out of bored frustration, half out of reading my misadventures and
not wanting to be leveled into the same (ahem) &quot;rank&quot; as me if they lost.
(Jerks!)  Anyway, since his victory he has been off in Hilo&#39;s Prince
Kuhio sector (guess he likes the cooler climate of Hilo over the blazing
heat of the Kona coast), waiting out this &quot;lockdown&quot; while trying to make
his fictional life better. Yeah. Right. Know that feeling all to well....

-----

Makalapua Lockdown Area (Kailua-Kona Sector).

&quot;Man I hope can find someone that is equal to me as a Duelist. Ever since
beating Nina only newbies have been dumb enough to duel me.&quot;

&quot;Ummm... that&#39;s nice.&quot; Janice sighs, looking over at Crystal only to
finally drag her to her feet and move her off to another table. &quot;Told you
we shouldn&#39;t let just about anyone sit next to us.&quot;

&quot;But he looked harmless enough.&quot;

Dmage looks at his watch, &#39;It&#39;s about that time when Nina always come to
Little Ceasar&#39;s to eat lunch.&#39; he thinks to himself. Nina, being a
creature of habit, hasn&#39;t been late to an lunchtime meal here on a non
event day yet, and sure enough.

&quot;I&#39;m a delicate woman, not an assembly line of episodic fun!&quot; Nina rants,
with Eliza in tow behind her, rubbing her forehead as she stumbles into
the area. &quot;Just want to eat and then go back to figuring out the whole
damned Special for today... man am I being beat down by all this thinking
though...&quot;

Dmage throws his star chips on Nina&#39;s table and says, &quot;Hey Nina lunch is
on me. But I do have a little favor to ask of you.&quot; Nina looks down at
the chips, looks up bleary eyed, looks down again, and sighs. &quot;Top Five
Stupidest Things Normals Ever Said To Me In Public&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Maybe a different topic for Special 4 (8).&quot; Eliza suggests.

DM shakes off the weird comment and goes on. &quot;Ever since our duel I have
wondered if it was just my skill that let me win or just that you had not
gotten the right cards for you deck. So how about it can we have a
rematch?&quot;

Nina sighs. &quot;Fine. Tomorrow meet me at the dueling platform. We&#39;ll duel
then... you can go first.&quot; (grabs her food and Eliza and shuffles her out
the door) &quot;We&#39;ll finish lunch in our theater... I know, Top Five Worst
Places to Stage A Hamtaro Field Trip Episode&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Your really stressing for a topic, arentcha.&quot;

&quot;What was your first clue...&quot;

-----

The next day.

Now that Dmage has waited until tomorrow he arrives at the tent and
notices it&#39;s about to rain so for no reason (since there&#39;s always a
static shield up over the area) he runs quickly to the tent. When he
arrives Nina and her female friend are waiting in the tent not sure what
they were doing before he got there.

&quot;Well, that was certainly... different.&quot; Eliza sighed, leaning her head
against Nina&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Give me a break. I was short on ideas and it
seems like a good Special at the time (we&#39;ll find out tomorrow)...&quot;
(looks up and sighs) &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you. Hello there DM.&quot;

&quot;How are you going Nina?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s &#39;how am I doing&#39;. Don&#39;t mangle the English language.&quot; (sighs)

&quot;Fine. Let&#39;s roll over the pleasantries.&quot; (Nina stands up and shakes
hand, watching DM slide his Mountain Field card in the field card area.)
&quot;Let&#39;s duel and first round privileges go to you Nina since your the star
of this duel!!!&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; (looks over cards before choosing a field) &quot;Try something
different. Sogen (Meadows). Now...&quot; (looks over cards) &quot;I&#39;ll play this
card face down, and a card goes into the magic/trap field as well.&quot;
(looks up) &quot;Your turn.&quot;

Nina - 8000LP (Sogen) DMage - 8000LP (Mountains)

&quot;Ok works for me. I place a mountain field card in the field card area.&quot;

&quot;YOU ALREADY DID THAT!!&quot; (sighs) &quot;Now what.&quot;

Dmage&#39;s side of the field is covered in mountains both large and small
peaks (but it&#39;s been like that for a whole turn). &quot;I play one of my Yugi
favorites. Skull Red Bird sing of attack in the monster area. Also I
place this in the magic/trap area.&quot;

Skull Red Bird (Field Power bonus)

Wind/ Winged Beast

Attack 1750 Defense 1400

&quot;Skull Red Bird attack that face down card with Bird Claws&quot;

Card is destroyed without resistance.

&quot;Well let&#39;s see what I got in my hand then...&quot; Nina sighs as she looks.
&quot;Working on something so I&#39;ll throw down a new card in the Magic/Trap
area, and lay another card face down in Defense mode while I plan my
strategy. Your move.&quot;

&quot;I draw my card...&quot; (waits as he thinks) &quot;Now I&#39;ll play 3 more cards in
the magic/trap area and then play a monster in defense mode. I also play
in the last magic/trap area Card Destruction since I have no cards in my
hand I do not have to draw any more cards. Then once you draw your cards
I&#39;ll have Skull Red Bird attack your face down card!&quot;

&quot;Fine.... my hand wasn&#39;t doing a thing for me anyway.&quot; (draws cards, and
smiles abit) &quot;Thanks for enacting my strategy by the way with Card
Destruction. Couldn&#39;t have pulled a useful card without your help.&quot;
smirks) &quot;First I&#39;ll flip my face down to reveal The Stern Mystic! That
means you have to reveal all those face down cards to me before I even
think of moving... oh, and your card draws zip because... here comes Red
Bird...&quot;(as Red Bird unleashes it&#39;s attack, three robed women take their
place and shield Stern Mystic from attack) &quot;...and there goes Waboku,
shielding my Mystic from attack and giving me an &quot;out&quot; from your
assault!&quot; (fingers other card) &quot;And I&#39;m just getting started on my
strategy, but first thing&#39;s first, you show me ALL your face down cards
right now! Then we&#39;ll see what I have in store for you next...&quot;

&quot;LOL you have to show my yours too!!!&quot;

&quot;Say what?&quot;

&quot;So here is goes...&quot; Flips over his cards Trap Hole, Change of Heart,
Acid Trap Hole, and Swords of Revealing Light. &#39;mmmmm...&#39; he thinks to
himself, &#39;I wonder what I will do next turn. Does not matter any or all
monster you play will die hahahahaha!&#39;

&quot;Should think quieter, makes people like me nervous listening to you
chuckle to yourself like that.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Hmmm...&quot; (thinks for a minute)
&quot;Well, damned if I do and damned if I don&#39;t. So I might as well take the
cheap way out and see what I can do with it. I&#39;ll toss down this card,
Mystic Clown, in Attack mode, and have them BOTH double suicide attack,
forcing your hand and triggering Trap Hole AND Acid Trap Hole from the
playing field at the same time! And once that&#39;s done I&#39;m open for attack,
but your two traps shy. Your move.&quot;

Thinks to himself &quot;Are you saying that Mystic Clown has an attack power
of over 1750 I think you are wrong remember my bird has that field
bonus!!!!&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t say I was attacking your BIRD! What I am doing, is forcing your
hand and your traps, triggering them on purpose to burn them
up!!&quot;(pointing at the field traps) &quot;Knocking them out of play right now.
Pay attention more often and you might learn something.&quot;

&quot;LOL I am not going to trigger them and oh in case I forgot to turn this
monster over the other face down monster is Giant Soldier of Stone. I can
trigger the traps if I wish to but I choose not too! attack if you wish!&quot;

&quot;Fine then, be a hard case about it.&quot; Nina leans back and thinks. &quot;I&#39;m
swapping both into Defense mode then, and let you waste your time trying
to get at my life points while I continue to plot my strategy.&quot;

&quot;Ok well I am going to tribute my bird for Summoned Skull and have him
attack your monster&quot; do you have any face down monster or magic/trap
cards I have forgotten.&quot;

&quot;Nothing worth showing you. Let&#39;s see...&quot; (blinks as she draws, a slight
smirk drawling across her face) &quot;Which one did you want again? The clown
or the Mystic? Doesn&#39;t matter either way because I drew a nice card here
that&#39;ll do wonders for me once you decided...&quot;

&quot;hmm I forgot you had 2 cards face ok I will kill the mystic and after
attacking I will flip summon my giant soldier of Stone&quot;

&quot;...and do WHAT with it?&quot; (sighs) &quot;Flip Summon a card that doesn&#39;t have a
flip effect? Sheesh. Well then, don&#39;t get too terribly attached to
Summoned Skull, he&#39;s going bye-bye!&quot; (shows card) &quot;SOUL EXCHANGE!&quot;
(smirks) &quot;I remember your brother playing the same move on me last time,
but this time I have the advantage... sorta.&quot; (throws down card and
triggers it) &quot;I&#39;ll tribute YOUR Summoned Skull for Swordstalker, in
Attack mode!&quot;

Swordstalker (Dark/Warrior) (Field Power Bonus)

Attack - 2600 Defense - 2080

&quot;You can&#39;t ignore me now! You either trigger your traps together or
Swordstalker drops your Soldier of Stone and my Mystic slips through the
backdoor afterwards and inflicts direct damage to your lifepoints!&quot;
(smiles) &quot;Now let&#39;s see if you can still keep your traps held down.&quot;
(smirks)&quot;Alright, DM, it&#39;s your move.&quot;

Dmage smirks, &quot;If anyone show be smirking it&#39;s me since I have lead you
into my web of traps hahaha...&quot;

&quot;Har har har har...&quot; phhht!&quot; Nina huffs, sticking her tongue out.

&quot;Ok anyways you have to skip attack phase when you use that magic card so
I am not using any trap cards.&quot; Smiles as he draws his card. &quot;Ok I just
got lucky I play Raigeki destroying all of your cards and I also play a
monster face down in the monster area. Your move and I have 2 monster
face down and I still have my 4 magic/trap cards in play.&quot;

&quot;Your pissing on my good mood...&quot; (draws card) &quot;I&#39;ll hold this in my hand
for now, since you still seem gunshy about doing anything useful. So...&quot;
(face blanks out) &quot;...what the hell...&quot; (silence)

&quot;...what...&quot;

&quot;Whatever you do...&quot; Nina slowly speaks, &quot;Don&#39;t turn around...&quot; Nina
slowly edges off her platform and walks around it... &quot;Don&#39;t move... and
don&#39;t turn around... no sudden movements...&quot; (she walks out of eyesight,
and silence reigns for a few seconds, until...) &quot;I NEED A MEDICO UNIT
HERE NOW!! STAT!!&quot; A few minutes of flurried activity and the day&#39;s duel
is called until Saturday. Nina doesn&#39;t show up on Saturday though.

DMage doesn&#39;t run into her until one week later... But, in the meantime.

2 Days Later.

Common Area 2 (conditions - hot and sunny)

(excerpt from Fictional Review Special 4 (8).)

A gathering is put together concerning the newcomers. and other things of
less importance.

Michi - &quot;First they post a temp. clock out there, now it&#39;s gone, and the
huge clock is still all messed up.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Then this new girl walks
into encampment yesterday, looks like she went through ten levels of hell
(yet somehow managed to get through the lockdown barrier), and then THAT
shows up (and also gets through the barrier to boot).&quot; (looks at other
female leaning on young woman in soft embrace, each has one arm wrapped
around the other&#39;s waist and both look utterly content)

&quot;Anything on the Alliance registry about a Human/Fox race? Her species
has me stumped.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Who knows.. I never heard of a funny looking&#39; animorphic fox race
like that one. though. they do seem familiar. Like I&#39;ve seen them
before.&quot;

Mina - &quot;The race or the coupling?&quot;

Nina - &quot;The coupling. Something familiar. but it can&#39;t be. that girl is
15 at least, and the one I&#39;m thinking of wasn&#39;t 15... At least, that&#39;s
how I remember it.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Not our concern. I sent their pics down to Command on link a few
hours ago, we&#39;ll get a response soon, but right now I know about the
clock situation.&quot; (everyone turns to listen) &quot;In 30 minutes they&#39;ll reset
the clock for Ice Age next week, which is.&quot;

Rahne - &quot;168 Hours. And since it&#39;s 2:30PM now that means it&#39;s 168 Hours &amp;
30 Minutes.&quot;

Michi - &quot;Phew!&quot; (whisks hand over head, making whistling noise as she
does) &quot;She&#39;s done it again!&quot; (hugs Rahne, rubbing cheek to cheek) &quot;She&#39;s
my little genius girl!&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Obviously.&quot; (sighs) &quot;It&#39;s time for another installment of the
Fictional Review Special right? Now it&#39;s No. 4 of 8..&quot; (looks at couple)
&quot;Are they going to be involved?&quot;

Silence, until finally Mina speaks up (raising her hand as she does).

Mina - &quot;I just had a scary thought.&quot;

Nene - &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Eliza won&#39;t pull her skirt up.&quot;

Nina - &quot;HEY!&quot;

Mina - &quot;Not that, I mean isn&#39;t DAG supposed to be a Limited Series?&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Damn, she&#39;s right.&quot; (looks around at everyone) &quot;Don&#39;t you all
remember? It&#39;s only suppose to be 8 or so episodes long!&quot;

Nina - &quot;Damn. And I was finally getting the hang of the work too.&quot; (looks
up at tent ceiling) &quot;Guess we could do full-time Specials, but rename
them something else, if we take over.&quot;

Eve - &quot;Weekly or Bi-Weekly?&quot;

Nina - &quot;Weekly.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Let&#39;s agree to rotate writing chores though when this goes
permanent. That way some of us gets a chance to helm this little
endeavor.&quot;

Michi - &quot;I got no problem with that.&quot;

Mina - &quot;Sounds like fun.&quot;

Everyone - &quot;Yeah.&quot;

Nina - &quot;How many DAG episodes are left?&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Maybe 3-4? Can&#39;t remember which but unless it&#39;s going ongoing it
won&#39;t last long. Then we crank up the digital equipment and.&quot;

Nina - &quot;THAT&#39;S IT!!!&quot;

Everyone looks at her oddly as Nina bounds over to the two and taps each
on the head lightly.

&quot;Renamon (the fox girl, though I never remembered her wearing clothes
and.)&quot; (blushes as she steals a peek) &quot;.whoa, digi-breasts. nice ones
too.&quot; (blinks several times just to regain her composure)

Keiko - &quot;What breasts? What!?&quot;

Nina - &quot;N-Nothing! Just noting she has human breasts now and she never.
wait a sec.&quot;

Rika - &quot;.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Same size as her&#39;s.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Nice. Could have told you that without you looking down her
shirt.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Sorry.&quot; (puts hand over girl&#39;s head) &quot;Rika (though last seen abit
younger). They&#39;re from Digimon.. Wonder if Renamon has a female vagina
now. want to check it.&quot;

Everyone - &quot;NINA!!&quot;

Renamon - &quot;Yes.&quot;

Everyone - &quot;? ? ? ?&quot;

Renamon - &quot;.yes.&quot; (cuddles closer to Rika)

Everyone - &quot;Oh.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Alright, you lost me this time (for once). What&#39;s a &quot;Digiman&quot;?
And isn&#39;t she a Digigirl?&quot;

Nina - &quot;Digimon. It&#39;s a Poke&#39;mon clone show. Nobody really liked it
around here and it never really took off except for cannon fodder to fill
the schedule on the vid channels, but the comic was bought for a time
(Dark Horse did that) and had it&#39;s own theater set-up for about almost a
year.&quot;

Michi - &quot;I was going to mention that.&quot; (looks at two) &quot;They don&#39;t look
familiar.&quot;

Nina - &quot;They&#39;re from Season 3. Rika&#39;s an iceberg and Renamon&#39;s moody.
though now Rena&#39;s all feminine and squishy and cuddly with breasts and
the whole 9 yards. Maybe she&#39;s boinking Rika.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;I can vouch for that. Eve and I bunk near where they were set up
last night and they boinked with all the enthusiasm of young girls, not
to mention the stamina.&quot; (stretches) &quot;Made me &amp; Eve feel rather old being
near them.&quot; (huffs breath and looks annoyed) &quot;Damn! We need to cut down a
little on the gut rotting food they feed us here and get our sexual
stamina back.&quot; (leans head on Eve&#39;s shoulder as both girls sigh while
looking at Rena/Rika&#39;s tender loving embrace) &quot;.sigh.&quot;

Nina - &quot;Guess being through hell seems to have lightened them up abit. I
guess. but I never thought they were lovers. I mean I thought it would be
cool if they were lovers, &#39;cause series like that NEVER promotes
alternative relationships, but this. well, it&#39;s weird and a half.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;Hell has a way of doing that to people. Though talkative they&#39;re
not, but the way they hold each other, make love, and how Renamon cuddled
Rika when she cried in her sleep (when they FINALLY did fall asleep)
kinda says lovers to me.&quot; (pauses) &quot;Kinda also says &quot;move to another
tent&quot; for myself on a personal note, too.&quot; (Eve nods her head to that
sentiment).

Nina - &quot;I suppose they must be from an alternate reality that&#39;s dead.&quot;
(Rika sobs once only for Renamon to cuddle her and nuzzle her face
against Rika&#39;s, whispering softly to the human girl) &quot;.sorry. .but what
the hell did they go through to end up this messed up? I like the way
they ended up lovers.&quot;

&quot;Whatever it was? The only thing that got them through was their love.&quot;
Nene notes.

Nina finally (with a slight nod of acknowledgment) motions for the tent
opening. &quot;Alright. Everyone to the holochamber, we won&#39;t get this Special
out the door hanging around here all day.&quot;

Eliza - &quot;What about them?&quot;

Nina looks at the two, then thinks. &quot;Take them along. We can at least
keep an eye on them.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------

Note - Starts a tad slow, so no lemon scenes for now, but there will be
as we go along! Promise.

Next - Duels &amp; Riddles
