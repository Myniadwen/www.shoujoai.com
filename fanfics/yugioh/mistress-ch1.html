<h1>The Mistress of Dragons and Cards (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Master Stadium (Orange Islands)
Within the Realm of Dreams (Edenina)
One Year Ago...

The battle of the &quot;sisters&quot; was coming to it&#39;s climax

Nene Kotobuki. AKA &quot;The One&quot;. Savior of this Dream world which they 
fought on. Visionary and warrior.

Far different than the girl who pranked and joked her way through high 
school years ago.

Nina Kotobuki. AKA &quot;The Mistress of Dragons&quot;. Master of the Orange
Island Gym Leaders.

Spiteful of her so-called &quot;sister&quot; (when in fact they were not 
related), she carried her grudge right into the arena and used it to
attack Nene all out.

But they were almost done with the battle... almost, not quite.

&quot;OLD FRIEND, FINISH THIS NOW!!&quot;

Nina can&#39;t help but smile, watching her Dragonite give the final blow. 
The last shot. Hyper Beam.

As the smoke cleared it was certain she had won. What did Nene have up 
her sleeve that she could...

&quot;PIKACHU!!&quot;

Nina&#39;s head snaps up, and her longest nightmare begins.

------------------------------------------------------------

One Year Later...

Citadel City (within the Realm of Dreams)

&quot;SHAKE IT OFF!! SHAKE IT OFF!!&quot; Nina screamed, but to no use. Pikachu
was on too tight.

Nene knew it was time, and she pounced hard on it. &quot;Now, Pikachu!
THUNDERBOLT!!&quot;

Nina clicks the switcher, changing the channel. Hmph. Last thing she
needed was to watch that no account loser Nene win again. Her pride
couldn&#39;t take it anymore after 30 viewings of that particular episode.
Frustrated she runs a hand through her short green hair, teeth clenched
as she did. (Since Nene also sported the same short green hair she did,
which did, in a sense, make them look like sisters when they were in 
fact not related.)

&quot;They&#39;re showing that old Orange Islands episode again?&quot;

From behind Nina, a familiar voice called out. A soft and reassuring
voice that made Nina smile unconsciously

&quot;You think they&#39;d show new episodes or something considering it&#39;s
coming up to sweeps month again.&quot;

&quot;Like I give a damn.&quot; Nina sighs, rolling over on the couch to look
back at Eliza, sighing inwardly as she watched the blonde haired woman
work to finish dinner. &quot;I couldn&#39;t care less what they do with Nene. 
I&#39;d personally like to see her get crunched or something equally 
violent...&quot;

&quot;Now wouldn&#39;t that be a pip. Nene Kotobuki-the &quot;One&quot;, crunched to
death by a Poke&#39;mon. Comments? She tasted like chicken. Here...&quot; Eliza
snaps her arm about, throwing something at Nina.

The green haired girl catches the object full on (in the face)
bowling her off the couch and onto the floor with a grunt. Why she 
rolled onto the floor? Mostly from the shock of the throw and the 
impact.

Eliza blushed, sweatdropped, and quickly apologized. &quot;Sorry, Nina. My
aim was a little off.&quot;

&quot;...&#39;liza? murder me after dinner, please...&quot; Nina griped, bringing
the box up to her face to look at it. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!(?)&quot;

&quot;You watch that show now, right? I see you watching it every
Saturday.&quot;

&quot;Only to stop watching the horror that is Poke&#39;mon since Nene became
the in-house favorite. I even heard rumors she and that other bratty
girl, Misty, have that &#39;special&#39; friendship going for them... wonder if
they did it yet?&quot;

&quot;Nene only had eyes for her one love, you know that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; The cards felt a little heavy in Nina&#39;s hands as the
thought of Mina Kobayakawa, a girl with such mirth and innocence, came
into her head. However did a sweet innocent girl like that fall for a
grousy jerk like Nene still baffled Nina to this day. But she remembers
how the two held hands, cuddled in public, and silently whispered their
feelings so only the other could hear what was in their hearts.

&#39;Mina must have had a cast iron stomach to even think of spending all
her days with Nene.&#39; Nina mused. Suddenly her attention focused on the
deck in her hand. &quot;Yugi&#39;s deck. Nice....&quot; Nina drawled, flipping the box over in her hands again and again. &quot;Now I have an ironclad excuse 
to wear boy&#39;s clothes, and do spooky voice accents making me look even 
nuttier than people think I am. Of course I&#39;m not specially equipped 
like one of us...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d do that without the cards, and unless you want to sleep on the
couch for a month you&#39;d behave yourself.&quot; Eliza chided, laying out the
dinner dishes as she did. &quot;Ready for dinner, or would you rather deck
build first?&quot;

&quot;Eliza, before I can deck build I need some Boosters...&quot; (pack of
boosters whacks Nina in the head, bowling the girl over again) &quot;Sorry
again. Did that hurt? Michi always said your head&#39;s too hard to hurt.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m over the urge to strangle you.&quot;

Building the deck wasn&#39;t as easy as Nina thought it would be.

She spent about several hours just rotating cards, flipping through
resources online, and trying to mix and match a perfect deck. In that
span of time she build, and dismantled the deck over a dozen times, and
toyed with the thought of a Side Deck two dozen times. By the time she
felt Eliza&#39;s hand on her shoulder she knew it had to be late.

&quot;Nina? Come to bed, it&#39;s too late to deck build.&quot;

&quot;Almost got it...&quot; Nina yawned, rifling through the cards one more
time to make sure she had it right. She didn&#39;t build a Side Deck (for
now) but she had some cards on the side for a Fusion Deck (she had
Polymerization in her deck). &quot;Think I nailed it.&quot;

&quot;The cards&#39;ll still be here tomorrow. Nail it then.&quot;

&quot;Your just grousy because something else isn&#39;t being nailed...&quot; (Nina
feels Eliza&#39;s hand smack her across the back of her head as the other
woman turns and walks back to the door), &quot;Just come to bed already.&quot;

Nina sighs, regretting abit her childish antics with &#39;liza. Slowly
she flips the deck side over side in her hand, feeling the cards as she
did. Well, she was just about as ready as she could be. All she needed
now was an opponent to try them out on. Somebody to duel against.

She puts the cards down and goes to bed.

As she reaches the bed, tiredly pulling her jacket off as she did,
she felt two soft hands pull her in, rolling her over as they did.
&quot;Thought someone was tired...&quot; Nina chided, feeling the other girl&#39;s
hands gently caress her breasts.

&quot;I&#39;ll sleep in late.&quot; the other girl sighed, fingers slowly pinching
and toying with Nina&#39;s nipples through her silken bra. Nina leans her
head back, mouth open as her bra slides off, exposing her breasts. 
Nina&#39;s hand reaches down, sliding across the other girl&#39;s body, feeling 
her nude form behind her.

&#39;Naughty girl.&#39; Nina thought, relishing in her lover&#39;s touch as she
sighed. Eliza was not just a girl though, she was an Amazonian (a 
species found only in the Realm of Dreams). Nina&#39;s hand knew what to 
do, and what Eliza wanted more than anything, as she reached down and 
slowly grasped the girl&#39;s penis. Eliza shuddered at the touch, feeling 
Nina slowly stroke her to erection. As she did this, Eliza reached a 
hand between Nina&#39;s legs and slowly began to painstakingly rub and 
stroke the green haired girl&#39;s clit. They went on, for long moments, 
masturbating each other until at last Eliza leaned back, rolling Nina 
onto her back. Before the green haired girl could protest, Eliza 
rotates herself until her penis could easily access Nina&#39;s sex, her 
hands holding her up as she began to thrust into her lover.

Nina&#39;s breath caught, her breathing became ragged, as she began to
massage Eliza&#39;s breasts moaning as she did. Both girls began to tense 
as their moments rose, Eliza&#39;s eyes focused only on Nina as they made 
love, sweat rolling from her body and plipping in little drops on 
Nina&#39;s. Nina suddenly raises one of her legs, rubbing it against 
Eliza&#39;s womanhood, trying her best to give her double stimulation, 
pushing her over the edge. The room filled with the sound of their 
passions, the heat of their love pushing them to climax.

As the moment hit, and climax came, both girls screamed, body rigid
and tense as waves of undying pleasure washed over them. For long 
moments neither girl moved, shuddering as their climax drained them, 
until at last Eliza fell on top of Nina, breath rasping as the girls 
cuddled.  Slowly, they fell into a deep sleep, naked and embraced in 
each other&#39;s arms, dead to the world and only real to each other in a 
soft gentle sub-dream state.

(it&#39;s hard to dream-dream in the Realm of Dreams after all.)

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Normals?&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Nina responds, feeling the deck in her old Orange Island
Gym Leader uniform pocket as she walked with Eliza through the bustling
sidewalks of Citadel City towards the Command Center.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d at least start with a few people at our level.
Dreamlings or characters, but a full fledged Normal? At least think 
about starting small first. You haven&#39;t even tried playing with your 
cards once so your still very new at this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to get any better just waiting for a challenge to walk
up to me, you know.&quot;

Nina. A nice enough girl. But once she&#39;s set her mind on something
it&#39;s very hard to get her to change her mind even when it might be in 
her best interest. Like this instance.

Normals. In the Realm of Dreams they&#39;re the living. The people of the
waking world. The readers and the thinkers and the dreamers. They are
hard to work with, and harder to contact. Usually requests to work
through Normals is made through one of the Command Centers (so that a
link can be made and Normals can be &quot;invited&quot;). To date very few
&quot;Normals&quot; have been to the Realm of Dreams, some of which they later
regretted bringing (since later they became &quot;Enemies of the State&quot;).
The other two, Dreamlings &amp; &quot;Characters&quot; were more common. Dreamlings
being the original inhabitants of the Realm. Beings that lived in
people&#39;s dreams for countless eons. Characters being the more recent
inhabitants. Citadel City was mostly an Anime Character city, but other
cities existed with different character &quot;philosophies&quot; and make-ups.
&quot;Have you even thought of the first Normal your going to challenge? 
And, mind you, Normals are hard to work with. Remember the last two 
Normals that came here.&quot;

At this Nina stops and sighs, turning on Eliza with a stern expression. 
&quot;I remember dammit. I was there for one of them. But this is NOT 
another John Beam or Rusty Allen incident in the making. And lord knows 
I remember the events that spun from Allen&#39;s visits, believe you me.&quot; 
Nina shakes off the feeling, almost as if someone stepped on her grave, 
as she starts pulling Eliza towards the crosswalk leading towards the 
Command Center. &quot;I think we all learned our mistakes from those 
Normals.&quot;

&quot;And that lesson would be.?&quot;

&quot;Invite people we have good relations with.&quot;

&quot;We HAD good relations with them too, and look what happened!&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. but this time&#39;s different. Trust me.&quot;

Eliza sighs, the huge mushroom shaped building looming over them as
Nina hustles them in. &quot;Somehow I still have a bad feeling about this.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

An hour later... (Main Command Center Deck, 75th Level of Command
Center.)

&quot;Connection established.&quot; One of the female techs announced as she
clocked in.

&quot;Your kidding.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, &#39;liza. Not.&quot;

&quot;Why that site. or should I ask?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re publishing this story even as we speak. look. say hi to the
readers, &#39;liza!&quot;

(waves absently into thin air) &quot;What am I waving at again?&quot;

&quot;Never mind, tell you later. now.&quot; (looks over screen) &quot;.let&#39;s go
shopping for a Normal.&quot;
