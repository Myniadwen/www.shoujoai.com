<h1>The Mistress of Dragons and Cards (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../yugioh/mistress-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Nina lays one card face down. &quot;Alright, DM, let&#39;s see if your still 
good at biting bait. One card, face down, in Defense mode. Your move... 
and what do you mean I goofed last Episode? I... the Trap Hole thing? 
Trap Hole?! Alright! Alright! So it&#39;s Trap Hole! Sheesh!&quot; (looks 
crossed eyed at DMage) &quot;Who carries two or three Trap Holes in their 
deck anyway?!? And what are you gawking at?!&quot;

&quot;Ok I draw one and play &quot;Yami in the battle posistion. Increasing the
attack strength of my Sorcerer to 2050 and Attack the face down card&quot;
The card is destroyed, but it leaves Nina looking at DMage oddly.

&quot;Yami&#39;s the Dark card, right? Turns the field into a Dark field (like
playing in the Shadow Realm) right? So at what point did you think you&#39;d 
be playing THAT in battle anything?! Just play it!&quot; Draws a card, 
and gains a smirky expression.

&quot;These are the only two cards in my hand... so I have no choice but to
play through. I&#39;ll play Ryu-Kishin Powered, in Attack mode.&quot;

Ryu-Kishin Powered (Dark/Fiend) Attack - 1600 Defense - 1200

&quot;And I&#39;ll play one card face down on my magic/trap field.&quot; (one square 
on her field lights up and flashes) &quot;Now, it&#39;s your move. Last card in 
my hand (hand&#39;s wiped though I still have a deck to go through) so 
might as well blow it away. I&#39;m out of tricks so let&#39;s get this 
disappointment over with.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm you not looking so good I wonder you know what I have in store 
for you this round?&quot;

&quot;Geez. Guess what? I was sick the day they taught jerkanese in school.&quot;
The Dmage starts to grin as he draws his next card. But then his face
starts to look grin at the card that he drew. &#39;What is this card I have
never seen it before in my life what is it doing in my deck?&#39; He thinks 
to himself. &#39;Must be the special card Keiko left for me earlier.&#39;

&quot;...oh dear...&quot; (Nina sighs as she flaps her arms aimlessly) &quot;Must be
Keiko&#39;s card. Oh dear, her precious card she ranted about for a whole
episode. Oh no, I&#39;m doomed!! Pity me my life is over! Blah blah blah...
yeah, right.&quot;

&quot;I think I will play another monster face down in defense mode.&quot;
&#39;(that is my second face down monster)&#39; he thought to himself.
&quot;Ok Sorcerer of the Doomed show her why her monster is doomed attack
Ryu-Kishin Powered (you forgot to add his power bonus for the yami 
field).&quot;

&quot;Oh dear. I did forget it&#39;s power bonus... maybe that&#39;s because for 
this round IT HAS NO BONUS!!&quot; (flips card) &quot;REVERSE TRAP!! This card 
wipes all losses and gains on cards for one round! So while it sucks 
off your precious Sorcer&#39;s upgrades, it keeps my monster at it&#39;s full 
level! And NOT only did you waste an attack on me, I get to retribute 
in kind and once and for all REMOVE your creature from the field! Ryu-
Kishin? Give Sorcer of the Doomed a makeover!&quot; Card is destroyed from 
field.

Nina - 5560LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7640LP (Graveyard)

&quot;And one of those two cards better not be a Summoned Skull because you
didn&#39;t pay Tribute for it up front like I did for my Level 5 and above
cards, and no playing tribute from your deck either!&quot; (sighs as she 
draws a new card) &quot;I could rebuild my hand... but I&#39;ll play this one 
face down, just to match your two face down monsters.&quot; (motions towards 
DMage)

&quot;Ah Nina nice combo I see now why you gave Keiko a run for her money!&quot;

&quot;Really... I thought we were boring each other to death... figures that&#39;s 
why she ditched on me and made me leave...&quot; (clenches teeth, 
stops talking) &quot;...well? Don&#39;t just sit there waiting for a juicy 
morsel to hit you. Play!&quot;

&quot;Ok since I have some catching up to do I play a card in the magic/trap
area.&quot; The space on the field lights up. &quot;Also play Neo The Magic Swordman&quot;

Neo the Magic Swordsman (Field Power Bonus) Attack - 1900 Defense - 
1200

&quot;Swordman Attack that Ryu-Kishin Powered&quot;

Nina - 5260LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7640LP (Graveyard)

&quot;Your move Nina&quot;

Nina draws, and one eyebrow arches up in an almost Spock-ian manner.
&quot;Fine. Two can play that game. I&#39;ll throw this new card face down on the 
magic/trap field, and let you wait it out to see what I just 
played.&quot; One space on Nina&#39;s field lights up as DMage draws a card.

&quot;Ok I play another monster card face down in defense. Now Neo attack the 
first monster that she placed face down.&quot; A voice comes out of 
nowhere yelling.

&quot;Stop Dmage it&#39;s a trap don&#39;t do it!!!&quot;said grandpa.

Nina looks about the room and sighs, shaking her head as she does,
&quot;...and people think our stuff&#39;s cliche...&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the hint Grandpa but I think I have this one under control.&quot; 
The Dmage flashs the Kekio&#39;s card to him.

&quot;Don&#39;t you know that just one card will not win the match for you!&quot;
Grandpa said sternly.

&quot;Yeah I know anyways like I was saying Neo attack that first face down
card now!!!&quot;

&quot;William&#39;s right, kids just don&#39;t listen to their elders anymore these 
days.&quot; (Nina flips her card over) &quot;Mystical Elf. Plus this card...&quot; 
(flips) &quot;Book of Secret Arts which cranks up Mystical Elf&#39;s 
already impressive Defense up by 300pts! That means you just beat 
yourself down a few life points.&quot;

Nina - 5260LP (Graveyard) DMage - 7240LP (Graveyard)

Nina sighs, leaning over to look down on her field as she flips Mystical 
Elf face up. As the card appears it makes Nina sigh audibly. 
She leans on her platform holodeck and stares at the Mystical Elf 
thinking about nothing else but Eliza. Suddenly the Elf turns and 
smiles, &quot;Huh? &#146;liza?&quot; Nina suddenly gasps. Eliza, dressed as the 
Mystical Elf, motions with a come hither look, winking slightly as she 
gently summons Nina forward. With one leap off the platform Nina jumps 
onto the holo board and saunters up to Eliza, smiling from ear to ear. 

&quot;Probably just having a pointless dream sequence but who care&#133;&quot; (draws 
close and kisses Eliza for a few seconds, pulling back to admire her 
new &quot;costume&quot;) &quot;&#133;goddess, your beautiful in that dress&#133;&quot; (stops)
&quot;Does the girder for that costume squeeze too much? I mean the stuff
medival chicks wore&#133;&quot; (Eliza faints) &quot;&#133;and you wearing knickers or 
panties? What do brits calls their undies anyway if they&#145;re not old 
maid undies? And another thing&#133;&quot; (Eliza sweeps Nina&#146;s legs out from 
under her, knocking her on her rear as she stands, muttering as she 
does) &quot;&#133;that&#146;s more information than a lemon scene really needs&#133;&quot;

Eliza walks over Nina, standing over her torso and lifts her dress
slightly, tempting the green haired girl. With a breathy sigh, Nina 
sits up, moaning softly as she rubs herself against Eliza&#146;s torso, 
gasping for breath as she rubs her head closer and closer&#133;

&quot;Might work better if you actually raised the skirt first and went 
under it.&quot;

&quot;?&quot; (Nina looks, nearly sucking cloth into her throat) &quot;&#133;gasp!&quot; (pulls
back) &quot;Oh&#133; right.&quot;

&quot;Figured suffocation wasn&#146;t part of the plan.&quot;

Nina lifts the long skirt, darting under it and allowing it to fall 
around her. Eliza leans back against the mass of Nina&#146;s duel platform 
as she feels the girl begin her work. &quot;Goddess&#133;&quot;

Nina closes her eyes, and rubs her face against Eliza&#146;s penis, slowly
working it into erection as she plunges two fingers into her sheathe. &quot;I could make love to you blindfolded.&quot; (Eliza&#146;s breath draws short as 
Nina runs her tongue up and down her shaft, making her shiver and 
shake) &quot;&#133;which I&#146;m actually doing since it&#146;s dark down here.&quot;

(Eliza stops) &quot;Less talk, more love. Please&#133;&quot;

&quot;Say it.&quot; Nina teases, moving her head down to lick Eliza&#146;s clit, 
pressing two fingers into her womanhood. &quot;Please say it&#133; say what you 
want&#133;&quot;

&quot;&#133;gasp&#133;&quot; (Eliza holds onto the platform as she begins to sway her hips)
&quot;&#133;suck me&#133; love me&#133; goddess take me&#133;&quot;

&quot;That rhy--&quot; Nina feels Eliza&#146;s hand suddenly press her head down 
before she could utter another strange remark. 

&quot;NINA! Please!! I need it!!&quot;

&quot;Taste me then. I need you too.&quot; (Nina&#146;s breath catches as her own 
needs begin to reach her).

Eliza shudders for a few seconds before shaking her head, &quot;No! I don&#146;t
want to ruin the effect&#133;&quot; (rubs body) &quot;Silk&#146;s sooooo smooth&#133; want to 
orgasm smothered in silk&#133;. Nude body smothered in silky pleasure&#133; 
goddess&#133; want to cum like this&#133; so soft&#133;&quot;

&quot;I want something too!&quot;

&quot;Turn around&#133; get on your knees&#133; take off your pants&#133;&quot;

Nina complies, taking her clothes off slowly, making Eliza shudder.
&quot;Please! I&#146;m so&#133;&quot; Nina smiles, throwing her top to one side as she 
leans forward, pressing Eliza&#146;s erection between her breasts. Eliza&#146;s 
eyes shoot open, mouth going slack as she begins to wail, thrusting her 
hips in motion with Nina&#146;s minstrations. For a long minute she gently 
strokes between Nina&#146;s breasts until finally Nina jumps up and strips 
her pants, causing Eliza to cry out again. &quot;Nina!! Hurry!!&quot;

Nina smiles, bolting forward briefly to kiss Eliza&#146;s lips before 
turning, going on all fours as Eliza drops to her knees, draping her 
silk dress over Nina&#146;s body. &quot;Goddess&#133; I love you&#133; I wish I was here&#133; 
cheer you on&#133; watch you&#133; make love to you&#133;&quot; (slowly she enters Nina, 
her penis pressing into her womanhood. For long seconds they held 
tight, before Eliza begins to thrust into her, stroking her with each 
inthrust and push, tears flowing down her face as her need consumed 
her. &quot;Hold tight!&quot; Eliza rasps, her arms reaching to wrap around Nina, 
smothering her in the silk of her trailing dress as they made love.

For a few seconds, Nina&#146;s breath was gone, her body smothered in the 
soft sensation, before she could breath again. Sweat soaked Eliza&#146;s 
body, making the dress cling tighter as she stroked into Nina, Nina&#146;s 
own body beginning to sweat from the effort as well.

Finally the frenzied effort pushed Eliza over the edge. She madly 
shoved Nina down, hands tearing her dress apart as her sweat soaked 
upper body began to finally make contact with Nina&#146;s back, bringing 
Eliza upwards towards release, her voice raising in volume as she 
engulfed Nina beneath her. Nina, too far gone to resist, whimpered and 
moaned as she was overwhelmed by the effort, her own screams mingling 
with Eliza&#146;s. Finally, Eliza began to tense up. &quot;Nina! Nina! I&#146;m&#133; 
Nina!! Eyyaahhh!!&quot;

Her moment overwhelms her, her orgasm hit&#146;s the same time as Nina&#146;s, 
both girls screaming as they hit their high mark. Eliza suddenly shoves 
herself aside, grasping torn parts of her dress to smother her own body 
in silk, rubbing fiercely as she whimpered and cried, riding her orgasm 
smothered in silk, thrusting her hips up as she rubbed her body 
fiercely. Her hands stroked her pearl, wildly fondled her womanhood as 
her other hand stroked her penis, her body sweatsoaked and covered in 
silk. After a minute of self pleasuring, her hands working herself in a 
frenzy as she writhed and cried in the grips of her own need, she 
screamed triumphantly, a second orgasm rippling through her as she 
colllapsed onto the floor smothered in silk.

Nina laid on her face, her strength gone, looking over at Eliza as she
rubbed her own body, silk strewn about her, her face tear ridden yet 
sated.

&quot;&#133;I&#146;m so useless&#133;&quot; Nina cries, tears flowing down her face. Eliza lying
out of reach... her lover not touching her or even wanting her...
Nina suddenly snaps to. Her Mystical Elf (still dressed, and not Eliza)
was on the field now.

&quot;&#133;dammit&#133; other people have normal waking nightmares, I get the erotic
ones&#133;&quot; (looks down) &quot;No&#133; Eliza wouldn&#146;t do that&#133; she loves me&#133; we&#146;re 
made for each other&#133; she wouldn&#146;t just toss me aside to pleasure 
herself&#133; she wouldn&#146;t&#133; I&#133; goddess... I don&#39;t want to lose her... I...&quot; 
(looks at Dmage)

&quot;WHAT?!? I&#39;M MOVING!! HOLD YOUR HORSES!!&quot; Draws a new card. &quot;I&#39;ll keep 
this card in my hand... such as it is.&quot; (looks over field) &quot;Alright, 
it&#39;s your move, but right now your Neo isn&#39;t powerful enough to work 
off... I MEAN TAKE OUT... my Mystical Elf, (still in dream mode dammit) 
unless you have a trick up your sleeve you&#39;d like to try out that is... 
anyway, it&#39;s your move.&quot;
