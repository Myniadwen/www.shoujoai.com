<h1>The Crisis of Time</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/larryj.html">Larry Johnson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Toshiro!  Get in here, now!  And bring a bowl of hot water with a 
cloth, too!&quot;  my brother, Shosuke yelled at me from my father&#39;s room.  
&quot;Coming, sir wants-a-lot.&quot;  Quickly I grabbed a bowl, filled it with 
water, and set a cloth in it as I somewhat rushed upstairs to my 
father&#39;s room.  Quickly Shosuke grabbed the cloth out of the bowl and 
twisted out most of the water, setting it on my father&#39;s head.  
&quot;Toshiro, this is no time to joke.  Father is very, very sick, I&#39;m 
only asking you to help me take care of him.&quot;  Shosuke said.  &quot;Yes, I 
know brother..I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  I said with a bit of content.  
&quot;Toshiro...Come here,&quot; said my father, Baki, as I walked over to him 
he gently wrapped an arm around me.  &quot;Toshiro, make your father proud 
when he passes, and be a man, you&#39;re 16 now, you need to learn to take 
care of yourself.&quot;  &quot;Father...&quot; I said, full of content, &quot;Don&#39;t talk 
like that...&quot;  I was too late.  He was already dead.  &quot;Father..&quot; 
Shosuke and I said sadly.

Oops, sorry, I got carried away.  Time to introduce myself.  I am 
Toshiro Akura, brother to Shosuke Akura and the Dueling Monsters 
regional champion is my sister, Eriko Akura.  I am 16 years old, my 
birthday is July 29th, today is the 8th of August, meaning I just now 
turned 16.  My brother Shosuke, he is 17. Eriko is 19.  Shosuke and I 
both play Dueling Monsters now, we face eachother and we usually play 
partner dueling with friends.  My favorite card would have to be the 
Dark Mage.  His attack power may be only 2600, but there are so many 
cards that you can use to beef him up!  Plus he looks cool!  Shosuke&#39;s 
favorite card is unusual, it&#39;s a magic card called Monster Reborn. He 
has at least 17 of them in his 60 card deck. Eriko&#39;s favorite card, 
hm...Not sure, she&#39;s been out of touch ever since she made Regional 
Champion.  Our mother died also a few days before my father.  They 
both came down with a rather bad sickness.  Shosuke and I were lucky 
enough to not catch it, or maybe it just affects old people.  Anywho, 
back to the story.

&quot;It&#39;s time to duel!&quot; I said as I faced my first opponent in the 
tournament.  His name was Akihito.  We were playing on a 
mountain/land/water field.

Akihito - 8000 LP (Water/land)  Toshiro - 8000 LP (Mountain/land)

We drew our cards.  I was the first to go.  &quot;To start off this match, 
I play a card face down, also a monster, in attack mode.  Go, 
Behemoth!&quot;

Behemoth (Dark) - Attack 2400 - Defense 1800 (Land)

&quot;Hmph, not bad for a first draw, Toshiro,&quot; Akihito said with a rather 
evil grin.  &quot;To counter off your monster, I call upon the Dark 
Magician in attack mode, destroy that pest, my friend, dark magic 
attack!&quot;

Dark Magician (Spellcaster) - Attack 2500 - Defense 2100 (Land)

The Magician sent the wave of Dark energy at my Behemoth.  &quot;Ah, you 
have seem to forgotten the card I placed face down.  I slowly pulled 
it from it&#39;s set position and showed it.  &quot;Dark Matter, a magic card, 
automatically boosts Dark Monster&#39;s defense up by twice it&#39;s old 
defense, and adds on 800 Attack, sacrificing only 900 LP!&quot;

Behemoth (Dark) - Attack 3000 - Defense 3600 (Land)

&quot;Go, Behemoth, Dark Breath!&quot;  The Magician was slayed.

Akihito - 7500 LP (Water/land) Toshiro - 7100 LP (Mountain/land)

Akihito just stared at me for awhile, before grinning. &nbsp;&quot;So, Toshiro, 
you may have dented my life points, but you have dented yours even 
more!&quot;  A cackle came from him.  &quot;Hmm, maybe so, but if I draw what I 
want, I can restore that damage..&quot;  I drew the two cards from my deck.  
&quot;Ahhah!  And I have drawn what I wanted, plus a little bonus..!&quot;  I 
showed him my card, then put it in play.  &quot;Dian Keto The Cure Master 
gives me 1000 life points, giving me 8100 LP!&quot;  I smirked, as his eyes 
nearly bulged out of their sockets.  &quot;And my turn is not over yet!  I 
may not have a monster in my hand now, but I can still use a magic 
card!  I use Monster Reborn, to call upon your Dark Magician in attack 
mode, and to use it on my side!  And since he has not at all used his 
attack, I attack you directly!  Go Magician, Dark Magic Attack!&quot;

Akihito - 5000 LP (Water/land) Toshiro - 8100 LP (Mountain/land)

Monsters - Akihito, None - Toshiro, Dark Magician (2500Atk/2100Def) 
Behemoth (3000Atk/3600Def)

&quot;You&#39;re turn, my friend.&quot;  I said as Akihito nearly fell down sobbing 
as his plans went to pieces.  He drew his card.  &quot;Useless...&quot; I heard 
him mumble. Then, he thought up something, not sure what, but his eyes 
lit up like two candles.  &quot;I place my Great White card in the water 
field, and I place a card face down. &nbsp;My turn is over.&quot;

Great White (Water [Fish]) - Attack 1800 - Defense 800

&quot;Hmph,&quot; I said, smirking.  &quot;You think I&#39;m too much of a fool to see 
that you placed down a trap card?&quot;  I drew my two cards again.  &quot;This 
will hurt you dearly, Akihito.  I place one card, face down.  Now, 
Behemoth, Dark Breath that Fish!&quot;  &quot;But wait, I have a card face down, 
Trap Hole!  Which will destroy your Behemoth!&quot; He cackled again, but 
yet I shook my head, saying &quot;I don&#39;t think so, Akihito, as I said, do 
you take me for a fool?&quot;  I turned over the face down card.  &quot;Remove 
Trap, remove that trap card.&quot;  The trap was gone, and Behemoth quickly 
made tuna out of that Great White.

Akihito - 3800 LP (Water/land) Toshiro - 8100 LP (Mountain/land)

&quot;Seems as if you&#39;re finished, Akihito.&quot;  I said confidentally.  This 
was one of my first full-fledged battles, and I was quite happy I was 
winning at such an edge.  &quot;Seems so, but not quite!&quot;  He said as he 
drew his two cards, smirking wildly.  &quot;I have you now, Toshiro!&quot;  I 
must admit that shocked me, the sudden confidence.  Maybe he was 
right.  Maybe he did have me done for. &quot;I play this magic card, life 
drain, which drains you to half of your life points!&quot;  A dark hand 
came out from the virtual field and grasped me..I felt as if it pulled 
some of my soul with it.  &quot;And my turn is not over yet!&quot;  Akihito 
said, a sparkle in his eyes, &quot;I play the Garneshia Elephantress in 
attack mode, a long with this card, the Sword of Insistence which 
boosts my Elephantress&#39; attack and defense by 500, and the field power 
bonus increases my Elephantress&#39; attack by 200!&quot;

Garneshia Elephantress (Land) - Attack 3100 - Defense 2500

&quot;Hah!  My Elephantress is even more powerful than a Blue Eyes White 
Dragon card!  Go Elephantress, stomp that Dark Magician!&quot;  The 
Magician turned to dust as she attacked him.  I stared in awe for 
awhile, until he caught my attention.  &quot;Your turn, Toshiro, and use it 
wisely.&quot;

Akihito - 3800 LP (Water/land) Toshiro 3450 LP (Mountain/land)

&quot;Hmm....Very nice combonation, my friend.  Let&#39;s see here..&quot;  I said 
swiftly as I drew up my cards.  &quot;So, his Elephantress is more powerful 
than a blue eyes white dragon huh?  Well, I have something for my 
behemoth.&quot;  I thought, as I placed a card next to my Behemoth.  &quot;My 
Behemoth was already powerful enough, but lets see what happens when I 
mix it along with this card, Dark Energy, which gives my Behemoth a 
200+ Attack and Defense bonus!&quot;  I smirked, nodding to the Behemoth.  
&quot;Go Behemoth, Dark Breath that vicious Elephantress!&quot;

Behemoth (Dark) - Attack 3200 - Defense 3800

Akihito - 3700 LP (Water/land) Toshiro 3450 LP (Mountain/land)

&quot;Hah, very good Toshiro!  I&#39;m beginning to see why you&#39;re the brother 
of the regional champion here. Let&#39;s see.&quot;  He pulled out his three 
cards, and laughed that evil cackle again.  I knew it was not anything 
good.  &quot;I use Fissure, which destroys one of your opponents monsters 
with the lowest Attack power, which in your case, is your Behemoth!&quot;  
He smirked as a crack appeared in the ground, throwing the Behemoth 
into the darkness, and my magic cards with it.  &quot;I&#39;m not done yet!  I 
use a magic card, Ookazi, which deals 800 direct damage to you!  And, 
to top it off, I play Dragon Zombie, in attack mode!&quot;

Dragon Zombie (Dark) - Attack 1600 - Defense 0

Akihito - 3700 LP (Water/land) Toshiro - 2650 LP (Mountain/land)

I drew my next card.  &quot;Hmm,&quot; I thought, &quot;Mystical Elf, I&#39;ll play her 
down in defense mode.&quot;  I figured this would work out, just as I was 
about to set him down, I remembered about the card I had in my hand.  
&quot;Gah, why didn&#39;t I play this earlier?  Oh well, it&#39;ll have to do.&quot; I 
said softly.  &quot;Okay.  I play Mystical Elf, in attack mode!&quot;

Mystical Elf (Light) - Attack 800 - Defense 2000

&quot;Haha!&quot;  Akihito laughed, looking at my elf.  &quot;You think THAT can 
destroy my Zombie?  Hahaha!&quot;  He nearly fell over with laughter.  &quot;I&#39;m 
not finished yet, Akihito.&quot;  I said loudly as I played my magic card. 
&quot;I also play this magic card, Left Hand Sword, Right hand Shield, 
which switches the monsters attack and defenst around for this turn!  
Go Mystical Elf, destroy that monster!&quot;  The dragon made easy prey for 
the elf, since he had 0 Attack.

Akihito - 1700 LP (Water/land) Toshiro - 2650 LP (Mountain/land)

This caught his attention.  He stopped laughing rather quickly, which 
absolutely made me chuckle, grinning wildly at him.  &quot;Stunned, are you 
Akihito?  You shouldn&#39;t have played that Dragon Zombie.&quot;  &quot;That was a 
stunning blow, I must admit Toshiro, though I&#39;m not done yet.&quot;  He 
pulled out his cards from his deck, grinning all the way.  &quot;Hmph, 
seems I have nothing but a De-Spell card for right now.&quot;  &quot;De-spell, 
destroy that magic!&quot;  The de-spell worked it&#39;s magic, making my 
Mystical Elf go back to it&#39;s normal attack and defense points.  &quot;I 
play Feral Imp, in attack mode!&quot;

Feral Imp (Dark) - Attack 1300 - Defense 1400

&quot;Go Feral Imp, destroy that Elf!&quot;  Akihito commanded as the elf was 
destroyed.

Akihito - 1700 LP (Water/land) Toshiro - 2150 LP (Mountain/land)

Quickly I pulled out my two cards.  HAH, I won it! &quot;Yes!  Akihito, I 
just drew the two cards that will put you out of your misery.  I set a 
magic card down on the field, Hellfire, which drains you of 1000 LP 
and drains me of 500 LP!&quot;  I grinned as it zapped him, and barely even 
touched me.  &quot;And I&#39;m not finished, I play, the Blue Eyes White 
Dragon, in Attack mode!  Go, Blue Eyes, White Lightning Attack!&quot;  
&quot;NOOO!&quot; Akihito said as the attack hit, as if he didn&#39;t know it was 
already over, he looked at me with a sign of hatred in his eyes.

Akihito - 0 LP - Winner - Toshiro - 1650 LP</pre>
