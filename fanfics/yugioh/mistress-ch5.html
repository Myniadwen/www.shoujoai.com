<h1>The Mistress of Dragons and Cards (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yugioh/index.html">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../yugioh/mistress-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>May 6th, 2002 (Makalapua/K-Mart section) (lockdown in effect until 
further notice) 

Kailua Kona Sector 

From the private records of Nina Kotobuki (reporting from Kailua-Kona 
Sector) 

It&#146;s been three days since lockdown started, and I haven&#146;t regretted 
ditching out on that Magey guy yet. I guess, if I didn&#146;t let my pride 
talk for me, that I was well on my way to losing. But I won&#146;t do that 
so I could have won it if I wanted to! Just didn&#146;t catch my second wind 
yet that&#146;s all! 

A note on Lockdown for those not familiar with the term. 

Nothing really gets done in a Realm of Dreams unless it&#146;s first done in 
reality, that includes movie additions. So, sometimes, when a big movie 
comes out we arrange these lockdown events. Huge tent cities are set up 
around key theaters, and people settle in and wait for reality to catch 
up to our desires. 

Sometimes reality take awhile to catch up to our desires. Last lockdown 
I sat through was for Lord of the Rings and that lasted from December 
to February! Good think Eliza and I found lots of things to do while 
waiting&#133; things that usually didn&#146;t leave the comfort of a laying 
position mind you, but still&#133; 

This lockdown revolves around two movies (not just one like before). It 
revolves around Spider-Man &amp; Star Wars Episode II-Attack of the Clones. 
There are other movies but they won&#146;t get this sort of treatment. Won&#146;t 
see another lockdown in fact until Christmas and &#147;Lord of the Rings-Two 
Towers&#148;. (Which is fine by me since I usually need a few months to 
recover from a lockdown event.) 

Anyway, with lockdown in effect (and my having conveniently forgotten 
to tell DM about it) he will have no choice BUT to go back since he 
can&#146;t wait out there forever. And since it&#146;ll probably take the whole 
summer (heaven forbid) to get through this lockdown? He will have long 
forgotten the match and will never come back again. Not that I&#146;m 
complaining mind you&#133; right now Eliza found a nice little spot and 
we&#146;re&#133; uhh&#133; relaxing. 

&#147;What does my little baby want?&#148; 

Nina gasps, a few tears flowing down her face, sweat dripping from her 
breasts as she looks back, arms shaking as she tries to hold herself 
still. &#147;&#133;you know&#133;! Please&#133;.&#148; 

&#147;Say it&#133;&#148; (plunges a third finger into Nina, causing the girl to cry 
out) &#147;&#133;your so sweaty and smell soooo naughty&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Eliza!&#148; 

&#147;Sorry&#133;&#148; (rubs head against Nina&#146;s back) &#147;&#133;I just want to hear you want 
me.&#148; 

&#147;I DO WANT YOU!! I LOVE YOU!!&#148; Nina cries, a few more tears flowing. 
&#147;Don&#146;t make me beg! Please! I&#146;m&#133;&#148; (grits teeth) &#147;&#133;goddess fuck me&#133;&#148; 

Eliza moves into position, rubbing her head on Nina&#146;s back as she 
talks, &#147;Oh goddess fuck me! That&#146;s all&#133; please&#133; let&#146;s cum together&#133; 
PLEASE!! I&#146;LL DO ANYTHING!! DON&#146;T ABANDO&#133;&#148; (Nina&#146;s eyes shoot open, 
realizing she was speaking her fears). Eliza stops, shudders briefly as 
if Nina&#146;s words stabbed into her, then does something unexpected. &#147;Oh 
goddess NO!!&#147; She grabs Nina and sits her upright. &#147;NO! NO! DON&#146;T STOP! 
Do&#133;?&#148; Eliza hugs Nina, crying on her shoulder. &#147;Is that is?! You think 
I&#146;m going to abandon my heart? Oh goddess no&#133; please no&#133;&#147; Eliza lays 
down, her own tears flowing as she looks up at Nina. &#147;Please goddess 
fuck ME!&#148; (eyes teary as she looks up) &#147;My sweet emerald goddess&#133; I 
don&#146;t want anyone but you&#133; please&#133; goddess&#133; please&#133;.&#148; 

Nina shakes abit as she climbs onto Eliza&#146;s penis, her hand sliding 
into the blonde girl&#146;s womanhood as she mounts. For a few seconds Eliza 
can&#146;t breathe, her lungs emptied by the sudden jolt of pure pleasure. 
Slowly Eliza begins to moan, rotating her hips as Nina begins to ride 
her fiercely, hand stroking into her womanhood as she makes love to her 
penis. 

&#147;GODDESS!!&#148; Eliza screams, &#147;Emerald goddess&#133; fuck me!! Oh goddess!! Oh 
swwweeett&#133;.&#148; The two girls stroke vigorously into each other, sweat 
dripping from their bodies as each calls out to the other, hands 
groping breasts and Nina&#146;s one hand sliding into the blonde girl&#146;s 
secret pleasure. 

&#147;NINA!! I&#146;M CUMMING!! PLEASE GODDESS!! IT&#146;S&#133;. OOOHHH!!&#148; 

Nina grits her teeth, crying out Eliza&#146;s name as her own orgasm washes 
over her, both girls experiencing perfect bliss as the same moment. As 
the waves of pleasure engulf them, Nina falls on top of Eliza, both 
girls gasping for breath and holding each other&#146;s sweat coated bodies. 

&#147;My sweet goddess&#133; oh Nina&#133; beautiful Nina&#133;&#148; Eliza whimpers, holding 
Nina tight. 

&#147;Next time let&#146;s find a place that&#146;s devoid of life.&#148; Nina asks, 
stopping where cars would usually zip through and regarding the food 
tent &amp; K-Mart (Little Ceasars&#146; inside). 

&#147;It was pretty quiet for the back field behind K-Mart.&#148; 

&#147;Except for the three straight boy/girl couples (never saw that new 
girl Opal naked before. She does have quite a cute body for a straight 
girl) and one girl/girl besides us doing it in the background.&#148; (Nina 
sighs) &#147;It doesn&#146;t bode well for my ego to think your watching 
Michi/Rahne screw while we&#146;re making love.&#148; 

&#147;The mere fact you mentioned them makes me think you watched them more 
than me. (And Opal did have a rather cute body. Her boyfriend must be 
the luckiest guy in this lockdown).&#148; 

&#147;Think they&#146;re engaged or something. Not just sex-wise mind you. 
Anyway, as for Rahne and her sextoy, I just noticed how Rahne kept 
shoving her tits in Michi&#146;s face every time that horrid blue blood made 
those sick faces at us.&#148; (Nina slams her fist into her open palm) &#147;Know 
it all bitch thinks she&#146;s so smug. Makes me want to wallop her one!&#148; 

&#147;Why don&#146;t we eat instead&#133;.&#148; (Eliza drags Nina towards K-Mart). 

Nina gives her own &amp; Eliza&#146;s credit chips a quick recharge before they 
walk towards the small food section. &quot;I&#39;ll go to the snack bar and see 
what they have.&quot; 

Nina stops, frozen in place. 

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; 

&#147;That&#133; voice&#133; it CAN&#146;T be&#133;&#148; 

&quot;May I help you?&quot; 

&quot;Well what would you recommend?&quot; 

&#147;No!&#148; (Nina holds her head) &#147;No! NO!NO!NO!!!&#148; 

&#147;What are&#133;&#148; (thinks for a second) &#147;&#133;is that the guy Keiko made you 
duel?&#148; 

The counter girl smiles &quot;Whatever you feel like.&quot; 

&quot;Ok well I think I will have a corndog.&quot; 

&#147;AGH!!&#148; Nina suddenly rushes forward and shoves Dmage aside. &quot;At Little 
Ceasar&#39;s?!? Gimme a break!!&quot; (Eliza walks up to Nina and takes one of 
her arm&#145;s into her own, mostly to keep the other girl from physically 
assaulting the male next to her.) &quot;Hey Nina.&quot; 

&quot;Hey, Janice. Working here? Thought you were here for the movie?&#147; 

&#147;I am, but I decided to sit in on counter while the girl who was here 
relieves her tensions with her lover in the back office. They get so 
overwrought and they only work 6 hours a day.&#147; 

Nina smirks, &#147;That&#146;s what we get for letting lemon characters with 
raging hormones work around here. Give me my usual pizza, give Eliza 
her usual... and give Mr. Big spender here a combo pizza. 

Plus three cups for drinks. And we&#39;ll eat here.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;ll be 1500 credits please.&quot; 

Nina grabs the chip out of Dmage&#146;s hand, and puts it in with hers, 
splitting the order in half. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; 

&quot;Hay&#39;s for horsies! Besides which, &#39;liza&#39;s a growing girl so back 
off.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not growing...&quot; (looks at Nina&#39;s glaring stare) &quot;...but I could 
grow at any second... 

it&#39;s (in theory) possible.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s the spirit. Let&#39;s hurry up and wait... here...&quot; (shoves the 
cups into DMage&#39;s hands) 

&quot;Be a useful male for once and pour drinks. Coke for me, diet coke with 
lemon for &#39;liza and whatever tickles your fancy. I don&#145;t care.&quot; 

After waiting for what seemed like forever they all got their food and 
Dmage inhaled it. 

&#147;Breath between &#147;bites&#148; why dontcha!&#148; Nina scoffs. 

During that time Nina passed idle chit chat with the Dmage, but mostly 
seemed to fawn over Eliza alot. When he finally went to use the 
bathroom, Nina grabs Eliza and they make good their escape. 

&#147;That wasn&#146;t very nice.&#148; 

&#147;Who the hell told him about lockdown?!&#148; Nina grumbled, looking about 
the crowds who weren&#146;t sitting in on something showing in the theather, 
or shopping, or relaxing. &#147;He&#146;s going to be trapped here with us for 
weeks! Months even! And he&#146;ll probably want to duel me again! Mind you 
were only a short distance away from the graveyard field so maybe he 
wandered in looking for me and was locked in by accident&#133; but still, he 
really did it to me now!&#148; 

&#147;Your becoming rather annoyed by this whole turn of events, aren&#146;t 
you.&#148; 

&#147;Damn right I am!&#148; Nina looks about in a fuss, only to be grabbed by 
Nene. &#147;Tell that loser boy you brought here to stop getting us mixed 
up!&#148; 

&#147;&#133;oh, it&#146;s you&#133; whattya want.&#148; 

Mina walks up next to Nene and tries to calm her down. Mina, who was 
sorta Eliza&#146;s counterpart for Nene (keeps the green haired one from 
blowing her top) had a mane of pink hair to counter Eliza&#146;s blonde 
hair, yet she had the same calming presence Eliza had. 

&#147;He asked about you, then if everyone was here (which they are not of 
course).&#148; 

&#147;Of course.&#148; Eliza pitches in. 

&#147;Then he said you ditched him, and he wants to finish you off, so I 
gave him my holoboard and I hope he buries you dammit!&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m going to love beating you into the ground when it&#146;s our turn to 
duel!&#148; 

&#147;What a little girl! Do something more constructive than duel all the 
time!&#148; (touches Nina&#146;s arm, slowly motioning for her to follow) &#147;At 
least I have more mature pursuits in mind. Gotta go. And next time you 
&#133;&#148; (Nina breezes past Nene and makes a quick grab at Mina&#146;s skirt) 
&#147;HEY!! FUCKIN&#146;&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Oops. Sorry Mina.&#148; Nina apologies, backing up. &#147;I thought Nene was 
into special girl love.&#148; 

&#147;&#133;you&#133; YOU FUCKIN&#146;&#133; FUCK OFF WEIRDO!!&#148; (Mina has to lead Nene away 
while trying to calm her at the same time.) 

&#147;You shouldn&#146;t have been so mean to her.&#148; Eliza chides. &#147;Anyway, just 
because she looks like you doesn&#146;t mean she has your taste in female 
lovers.&#148; 

&#147;Pity&#133;&#148; (kisses Eliza while rubbing her hand against the blonde girl&#146;s 
skirt in just the right place) &#147;&#133;she doesn&#146;t know the pleasure she&#146;s 
missing out on.&#148; 

&#147;Nina&#133;&#148; Eliza rasps, pushing the girl&#146;s hand away. &#147;Not now. Somebody 
might see&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Yeah&#133;&#148; (Nina bounces backwards and smirks as she looks at Eliza) &#147;It 
would be hard to explain the bulge in your skirt.&#148; (smiles wickedly) 
&#147;Guess we can tell everyone there is something in your skirt and you 
ARE happy to see me!&#148; 

&#147;Let&#146;s just find this male and let him duel you already.&#148; 

Ten minutes later Dmage finds Nina &amp; Eliza talking with the girl he met 
on the first day in lockdown, Opal. Of course it was obvious to me what 
was going on. 

&quot;I&#39;m telling you if you teach me your oral techniques with the penis, 
Eliza would have far more intense oral orgasms than she is now.&#147; (Eliza 
blushes deeper as Nina talks dirty with Opal), suddenly Nina stops and 
turns to face him. &#147; Well, speak of the duelist. Hey, DM.&quot; 

(Eliza sighs, her shoulders slump, as she no doubt had to keep herself 
from becoming aroused from listening to the conversation earlier.) 

&quot;How are you holding up?&quot; Opal asks with a sincere look, to which Eliza 
moaned &#147;Please don&#145;t say that again&#133;&#148;. Opal goes on without missing a 
beat. &quot;First timers sometime become stressed by lockdown mode. Being 
held in one place for a long period of time sometimes make people all 
wonky and stuff, this is my fifth time though so I&#39;m getting used to 
it. It helps to have people to talk to when sitting through a lockdown 
though. Makes it pass faster if you have friends.&quot; 

&#147;Or horny lovers who make it with you behind the buildings.&#148; 

Opal blushes, and walks off without another word. 

Opal - &quot;I&#39;ll see you around Nina, Eliza, maybe next DAG shoot?&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s not push our luck. See you...&quot; (turns back on DMage) &quot;Well? You 
ready to duel or what?!&quot; (DMage gives Nightmarchers to Nina) &quot;Thanks. 
Keiko was asking about getting this back. I&#39;ll hand it off on the 
next... augh...DAG shoot. Well...&quot; (puts card in pocket and sighs) 
&quot;We&#39;re not getting any &#39;younger&#39; so we might as well get the show on 
the road. The large field...&quot;(pulls out holoboard) 

&quot;...oh, I see somebody gave you a board. Probably Keiko since she 
wanted her card back in a bad way&#133;.&#148; (nudges Dmage) &#147;But I know better 
than that. Don&#146;t listen to her advice too much, she&#146;s stupid.&#148; 

But Dmage had something else on his mind besides Nene&#145;s advice. 

&quot;Just to make it fair let&#39;s put up our strongest Fusion monster card 
and winner takes them both. What you say? I will put up my Flame 
Swordsman and what will you put up?&quot; 

&quot;Hate to disappoint you, but all I got is Karbonala Warrior (fusion of 
both M-Warrior #1 &amp; #2 (what I call &#147;the Bishonen (Pretty Boy) Fusion
&#147;). It&#39;s the only Fusion card being handed out because it&#39;s the only 
one that was put into stock. (must be physically in &quot;stock&quot; to be 
available to any of us). But, if you want to duel away your Flame 
Swordsman (and I can use that because I have Masaki AND Flame 
Manipulator) that&#39;s fine. But I&#39;d rather trade. I&#39;ll trade Karbonala 
Warrior for Flame Swordsman. Sword for Sword. If you like, we trade (in 
physicality with real cards as well as in this game), if not? Shuffle 
your deck, let&#39;s find a table at the Commons&#39; area tent to set down, 
and duel.&quot; 

(Nina smirks) &quot;Alright, not to be cliche, but your move.&quot; 

&quot;What is Karbonala Warrior? I never heard of him. If I have the parts I 
will trade you!&quot; 

Nina shuffles through her spare card deck and pulls a Fusion card out. 

&quot;Here it is. Karbonala Warrior (check out the card list and images on 
the Yugiohdungeon site (Legend of the Blue Eyes White Dragon Boosters, 
English of course) for the image.&quot; 

Karbonala Warrior (Level 4) 

Warrior/Fusion 

Attack - 1500 Defense - 1200 

Fusion or M-Warrior #1-#2 

&quot;I&#39;ll even throw in M-Warrior #1-#2 with the trade. Deal?&quot; 

Commons Tent 3 (tent filled with tables, couches, TV screens, 
computers, a few pool tables and some arcade machines complete with 
enviroment control to keep the tent at a set temperature). 

(Somebody also set up different Animes or live shows on the TV 
screens.) 

Eliza isn&#146;t present (but she went to make arrangements for a special 
treat for Nina, so Nina doesn&#146;t mind her disappearance this time out.) 

Nina &amp; DMage take one of the tables and start playing, field set up. 

&#147;Ok I start with playing the field card Yami in the field card area. 
Next I play 3 cards in the magic/trap area. And to finish my move I 
play a monster card face down on the holoboard.&quot; 

Four of the squares (one for each card) flashes as DMage&#39;s side of the 
board darkens abit 

(Dark Field) &quot;Fine. Fine. Let me shuffle. No Blue Eyes, though. I&#39;ll 
take you out with my Dark Magician...&quot; (draws cards) &quot;Here we go 
again... I&#39;ll play Sogen on my side, increasing my Warrior &amp; Beast 
Warrior kick ass quota.&quot; 

Nina - 4000LP (Sogen) DMage - 4000LP (Yami) 

&quot;I&#39;ll play Celtic Guardian, in Attack mode.&quot; 

(a small version of the Celtic Guardian appears on the field, sword in 
hand and ready to go.) 

&quot;Plus I&#39;ll pump up it&#39;s points with Legendary Sword...&quot; (A new sword 
replaces Celtic Guardian old sword.) 

Celtic Guardian (Warrior/Earth) 

Attack - 2120 Defense - 1860 

&quot;Plus, just in case, I&#39;ll lay one card face down on the Magic/Trap 
field.&quot; 

One square flashes on Nina&#39;s side. &quot;Now I&#39;ll take a swipe at your face 
down card. Celtic Guardian? Attack!&quot; 

&quot;Damn it!&quot; 

Quickly Nina spins around to look behind her, &quot;What?!?&quot; 

Flips up Giant Soilder of Stone, which is destroyed in one shot. 

&quot;DAMMIT! Don&#39;t do that. made me think somebody was behind me... oh! I 
won? Cool! 

Didn&#39;t think I had it in me... heh, heh...&quot; (waits for next move, 
leaning on her open palms as she watches with mild interest). 

&#147;Ok I will draw a card and play it in the magic card area. It&#39;s a 
Fissure and I will also play another monster in the monster area 
facedown.&quot; 

&quot;Does that mean you destroyed my card? Guess so. Oh, well...&quot; (removes 
cards and put them in Graveyard) &quot;My turn as we end this Episode...&quot; 
(draws card and looks at her hand). &quot;I&#39;ll play Koumori Dragon, in 
Attack mode.&quot; 

Koumori Dragon (Dark/Dragon) 

Attack - 1500 Defense - 1200 

&quot;ATTACK!!&quot;
