In the Virtual Reality Prototype Game DM1-A

Time in Game: 12:48 PM

Mai drew her card, staring intently at the NPC she was
embroiled with. 
She had 2 cards on the field facedown, as well as her
Cyber Harpy in attack mode. Her opponent was defending
with his D. D. Trainer and thanks to his continuos
spell card Toll, every attack was costing her dearly.

Mai-1200(Wasteland)/Lasko-800(Wasteland)

&quot;Okay, Lasko, this is it,&quot; she announced, &quot;the end! I
play De-Spell to destroy your Toll card! Then I&#39;ll
activate my trap- Shadow of Eyes!&quot;

The D. D. Trainer reared it&#39;s steed and galloped at
the Cyber Harpy. The feminine siren screeched loudly
and thrust her claws into the air, rending the goblin
and his beast to shreds. 

Lasko-0(Wasteland)

&quot;And that&#39;s game over. I win!&quot;

&quot;Haha, you beat me fairly, Mistress...&quot; admitted her
vanquished foe.

&quot;And now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I think I&#39;ll take a
little break before my next match...&quot; Mai stated
simply, walking off toward her tent.

As she entered the tent, she sighed and wiped the
sweat from her brow with a hankerchief.

&quot;Wow, I don&#39;t know which is worse, my opponents or
this heat. Damn desert...&quot;

She sat down on her bed and lay back against the soft
cloth sheets.

&quot;I just wish something interesting would happen for
once. This game is getting old...&quot; Mai pondered.
Suddenly, a thought occured to her. &quot;I wonder... if
this world is all virtual, do you think monsters could
talk? Hmp. Beytter than talking to myself I guess...&quot;
With that, she pulled from her deck 2 of her favorite
cards, the Amazoness Paladin and the Harpy Lady. &quot;You
two have alwayes served me well...lets see what you
have to say.&quot; 

Standing up, she held the cards in the air. &quot;Here goes
nothing. Amazoness Paladin! Harpy Lady! GO!&quot;

The cards lit up with a brilliant glow. Waves of light
seemed to emanate from them as the monsters formed in
front of her eyes.

&quot;Amazing... It worked!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;Hey guys, hows
it going?&quot;

The two beautiful monters turned to look at her, then
at eachother. Slowly a grin spread across the
Paladin&#39;s face. She questioned the Harpy with her
eyes, nodding towards Mai. The Lady smiled, looked Mai
up and down, and nodded to the Amazon.

Slowly the two of them advanced on Mai, crowding her
back into the bed. She began to crawl backwards,
retreating fromn the cards that now seemed a little
*too* interested in her.

&quot;H-hey, guys, w-what are you doing?&quot; The blonde woman
stuttered.

In an instant, the creatures were upon her, the Amazon
sitting down hard on Mai&#39;s stomach, and the Harpy
sliding off her shorts.

&quot;Oof! Hey, stop that!&quot; Mai protested, trying to halt
the bird woman&#39;s actions, but the creature on top of
her was holding down her arms. 

As the Paladin slipped off her robe, revealing her
black satin panties and sumptuous breasts, the Harpy
Lady yanked off the duelist&#39;s underwear and ran her
tongue across Mai&#39;s flower in a long slow lick. She
twirled the seven inch muscle around her clit, lapping
up the sweet juices that had begun to run from her.

&quot;Ooohhhh...&quot; Mai moaned, her body beginning to give in
to the card&#39;s actions. 

With that implication of consent the Amazoness Paladin
reached down and with one gesture, tore off her own
panties, releasing her growing spike and already moist
orchid. She pulled loose the knot on Mai&#39;s top,
peeling away the stiff cloth from her voluptuous
breasts. Then, she placed her member in between the
blonde duelist&#39;s tits and gripped them with her hands,
sliding them back and forth over her hardened piece.

Meanwhile, the Harpy Lady had increased her licking to
a fervent pace, and was now sliding her toungue deep
ito Mai&#39;s womanhood. Mai screamed in pleasure at the
warm intrusion. It felt as if someone was pouring hot
pleasure into her very soul.

The golden-haired girl was now fully into the moment,
and reached around behind the Paladin, pushing her
rear up onto her chest.  &lt;I may not be the best
lesbian, but there&#39;s one thing I know I&#39;m good at!&gt;
she thought to herself, pressing the Amazon all the
way up into her face and opening her mouth. 

She closed her eyes as she felt the card&#39;s tool slide
down her throat. She bagan to repeatedly swallow, her
esophagus massaging the head of the Paladin&#39;s penis.
The Amazon&#39;s eyes rolled back into her head as she
groaned loudly, blowing her load deep into Mai&#39;s
throat. Mai gratefully swallowed the cum and slipped
the girl&#39;s member out of her mouth. 

Then, she moved her head lower and began to lick the
Paladin&#39;s nether lips in earnest, inhaling her rich
aroma of musk. As she slid her tongue deep into the
girl&#39;s body, Mai reached up and began to masturbate
her peice with her right hand.

The Amazoness moaned in pleasure as She felt a wave
build up inside of her. As the heat rose through her,
she sucked in air, then screamed it out as she blasted
through a double orgasm, splashing the duelist&#39;s face
and hair with her juices.

At nearly the same moment, Mai rode out her first
orgasm, wetting the Harpy&#39;s face with a jet of fluid. 

Now the Amazoness Paladin slid off of Mai, who looked
up at the wet face of her favorite card. Mai grinned
and nodded at the Amazon, questioning the Harpy with
her eyes. The Lady smiled and nodded smugly.

As the Paladin lay upon the bed, gasping after all the
orgasms, Mai and her Harpy Lady crawled aroud her,
positioning themselves at either side of her crotch. 

Simultaneously, they gripped their large breasts and
squeezed them together on opposite sides of the
Paladin&#39;s penis. The Amazoness looked up in confusion,
but quickly gasped and sunk back into the bed as the 2
girls began to pump they&#39;re breasts up and down over
her tool. 

With each downward stroke, they licked the head,
taking turns sliding it into their mouths. Suddenly
the Paladin screamed out as she fired a spray of cum
into the air, splattering the faces of Mai and the
Harpy Lady.

The Harpy now crawled over to the Amazon&#39;s head and
sat down on her face, facing her feet. She smiled as
she felt the grateful card close her mouth over the
bird creature&#39;s lips, her tongue massaging the
clitoris.

Mai, meanwhile, spread the Paladin&#39;s legs and
interlocked them with her own, then began to grind and
thrust her hips into the girl&#39;s own, their orchids
rubbing together. Mai leaned forward and met the
Harpy&#39;s cum drenched face in a kiss, her tongue
sliding into the card&#39;s mouth, tasting the juices of
herself and the woman she was tribbing, and who&#39;s
penis she was now rubbing with both her hands, sliding
first one down it, then the other. It felt to the
Amazon as if she was drinving into an endless vagina.

As the Harpy and Mai french kissed, the bird girl
broke the kiss, closing her lips around the duelist&#39;s
tongue and sliding down it&#39;s length as she felt an
orgasm wash through her, pouring out all over the
Paladin&#39;s face.

Moments later the Paladin rode out her second double
orgasm as she splahed cum between Mai&#39;s legs and
spattered it across the Harpy&#39;s chest. The duelist had
also reached her climax, drenching the Amazon&#39;s crotch
and thighs.

Finally all three girls collapsed to the bed, panting
and gasping for air. 

&quot;Miss Mai!&quot; called a voice from outside her tent.
&quot;It&#39;s time for your match! You&#39;re fighting Senior
Porky.&quot;

Mai watched as the two cards on either side of her
dissolved into light, and collected themselves into
her deck.

&quot;Too bad,&quot; she sighed as she wiped off her face and
pulled on her clothes. &quot;But I suppose it could be
somewhat important...&quot;
