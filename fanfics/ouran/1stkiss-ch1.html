<h1>First Kiss</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ouran/index.html">Ouran High School Host Club</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/taryn.html">Taryn</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;It&#39;s our responsibility as members of the elite Ouran Host Club to make 
every girl happy.&quot; 

Haruhi is a girl. Most girls treasure all their firsts. Their first 
boyfriend. Their first date. Their first dance. Their first kiss. Et 
cetera et cetera. 

Haruhi is a girl. Unlike most girls she isn&#39;t aware of people as 
potential mates. Her &#39;dates&#39; are at the request of the Princess&#39; of 
Ouran. Her first dance was a ball she was forced to attend at the whims 
of the Host King Tamaki Suoh. Her first kiss was sold to pay off a third 
of her debt.  

Haruhi is a girl. 

Just not like most girls. 

Her first kiss was surrounded by drama, intrigue, annoyance(&quot;I&#39;m in 
LOVE-LOVE&quot;) and thrills. Her first kiss was with princess Kanako 
Kasugazaki, a &#39;host-hopper&#39;. She&#39;s engaged, rich and and an adorably 
awful liar. She&#39;s cute and hides her face when she cries. She&#39;s a good 
dancer, likes tea sets and is in love with her fiance.  

Most girls treasure their first kisses. 

Haruhi is a girl despite not being like most girls.  

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen. It is now time for us to begin the final dance of 
this evenings festivities. The last waltz of the night has been chosen 
by the host club for... this couple.&quot; 

Haruhi watched with a quiet smile as Tohru bowed and asked for a dance. 
She watched as princess Kanako accepted. She knew the girl was happy - a 
little awkward - but happy. She watched them dance the last dance of the 
night. She saw them talk a little. Saw Kanako&#39;s face light up and knew 
that he was going to do right by her. Tamaki saw it too. 

&quot;*sigh* May this awkward couple be forever blessed,&quot; he exclaimed. 
Taking their cue, the twins stepped forward. 

&quot;And now we&#39;ll announce the Queen of the Ball!&quot; Hikaru announced. 

&quot;Congratulations princess Kanako Kasugazaki,&quot; Kaoru joined. Everyone 
applauded. 

Now, originally it was supposed to be the Host King Tamaki that kissed 
the night&#39;s Queen but in true trouble-making fashion, the twins 
announced that Haruhi would take his place. She wouldn&#39;t do it. She 
refused. There was no way that she could kiss her. 

&quot;If you do it we&#39;ll cut your debt by one third,&quot; Kyoya, the host club&#39;s 
shadow king, comments casually. 8 000 000 yen or almost a thousand 
requests cut by one third. And it was just a peck on the cheek. No 
problem right? 

Still, Haruhi&#39;s heart did a little jump every time she took a step. 
One... two... three... four... She watched Kanako start walking towards 
her, away from her fiance. Five... six... seven... eight... Good. It 
would be just them. Nine... ten... eleven... twelve... No interruptions. 
Thirteen... fourteen. Forget the audience, forget her fiance, forget the 
debt. Haruhi cradles Kanako&#39;s face between her hands. It&#39;s just a peck 
on the cheek. Kanako&#39;s probably already kissed. Just a peck. But her 
eyes... Haruhi felt Kanako&#39;s cheeks warm against her hands... saw her 
close her eyes as their faces drew near... watched her lashes flutter 
against her cheek... The cheek that she- 

&quot;Wait, HARUHI!!!&quot; 

What the-hmph?!!  

Most girls treasure their first kiss. 

So Haruhi ignored the large hand on her back, the screaming girls behind 
her, the startled exclamation of Kanako&#39;s fiance... 6.2 seconds, Haruhi 
ignored everything but the feel of her... the heat of her skin... the 
softness of her lips... the hair brushing against her hands... the 
girl&#39;s curves pressed against her own... 6.2 seconds was all Haruhi 
allowed before jumping back... 6.2 seconds of her perfume... 

Most girls treasure their first kiss. 

Like most girls, like Kanako, Haruhi pressed her fingers against her 
lips, trying to keep the memory...  

Haruhi is a girl.  

She never would have thought that she&#39;s end up giving her first kiss to 
another girl. But is was such and amazing night. So it&#39;s as well.
