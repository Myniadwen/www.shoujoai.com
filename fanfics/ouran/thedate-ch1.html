<h1>The Date</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ouran/index.html">Ouran High School Host Club</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Haruhi Fujioka rose, the black haired girl dressed in her perfectly neat 
boy&#39;s uniform, then began to read the passage from her text book even as 
she wondered how she got herself into this position. Well, in fact she 
knew exactly how she got like this.. she just couldn&#39;t believe her own 
bad luck at times.

Just a short time ago Haruhi had been searching for someplace quiet to 
study when she opened the door to music room three, and instead found a 
nest of beautiful men. The six students had, for various reasons, taken 
the room and converted it to a host club, providing a service to the 
many lovely ladies of the school. They also attempted to service her, 
and when she tried to escape she wrecked a vase... and doomed herself.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Haruhi nodded to her classmates with a gentle dignity as 
she collected her books, hurrying off.

As a scholarship student amid the wealthy Haruhi couldn&#39;t afford to pay 
for the destroyed vase, so instead a devilish bargain was struck. If 
Haruhi became a member of the host club she could earn her way out of 
debt by getting 100 customer requests.

&#39;Of course that didn&#39;t last long,&#39; Haruhi recalled wryly, &#39;when 
Ayanokoji caused all that trouble over me, they boosted it to 1000 
requests.&#39; She reached the top floor, south wing and finally slowed, 
knowing she was near her destination. She straightened out her tie, took 
a deep breath and headed in to the music room.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; the group said in their charming voices, perched in front of 
the window&#39;s so the light would hit the group of men just right.

&#39;You have got to be kidding me,&#39; Haruhi thought, sweatdropping.

&quot;Hey Haru!&quot; Hunny practically pounced on her, the childlike student 
looking so cute it was almost illegal. Mori followed in his quiet way, 
seeming almost a tower of strength.

Taking a moment to tidy her uniform Haruhi asked, &quot;Slow day?&quot;

&quot;Somewhat,&quot; Tamaki acknowledged, the blond haired man the king of the 
host club, &quot;but it&#39;s early yet.&quot;

The brothers Hikaru and Kaoru were off with a small group of girls, 
using their practiced charm on them. Haruhi had mixed feelings about 
them, honestly, especially in how calculated they could be towards the 
ladies. &#39;Of course in this group,&#39; she thought wryly as she gracefully 
poured a bit of coffee from the urn, &#39;they barely stand out.&#39;

&quot;Miss Aya was back again,&quot; Tamaki added in teasing tones and Haruhi 
blushed, &quot;but since you weren&#39;t here she left.&quot;

Aya Yamada was a new arrival at the school, a lovely redhead who had 
recently visited the host club. She had She had shared coffee with 
Tamaki, then tried out Hikaru and Kaoru, then finally it was Haruhi&#39;s 
turn. They had talked about being new students, about families and other 
things as they shared tea, and both had been faintly surprised at the 
strength of their connection.

&quot;Each of us picks up regular customers,&quot; Haruhi said with as much 
dignity as she could manage, &quot;it&#39;s probably nothing more than that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Takami sounded amused.

&quot;Does she know you&#39;re a girl?&quot; Hunny asked eagerly.

&quot;It hasn&#39;t really come up,&quot; Haruhi admitted.

&quot;You also pass as a young man so well,&quot; Kyoya Ohtori calmly noted, &quot;most 
of the girls don&#39;t even notice.&quot; The third tallest man in the Host Club 
Kyoyo as the club&#39;s shadow king, managing things from behind the scenes, 
but despite that Haruhi found him likable, mostly.

&quot;You might want to tell her if things go much farther,&quot; Tamaki smirked, 
a bit of jealousy in his tone. He had expressed a not so subtle interest 
in Haruhi from the start, and he clearly wasn&#39;t sure how to react to 
girls being interested in her seriously.

&quot;It isn&#39;t going to go farther,&quot; Haruhi said firmly, &quot;we&#39;re just 
friends.&quot;

&quot;You just keep telling yourself that,&quot; Mori said with his usual grave 
look. Towering over all the other hosts the usually silent man played a 
lot with Hunny, as well as offering a quiet companion for all the ladies 
visiting. Often Haruhi wondered what he was thinking about, but he 
seemed to be almost unreadable.

Just then the door chime rang and a bevy of young ladies arrives as a 
class let out, each choosing a companion. Haruhi felt herself smile as a 
familiar figure walked to her, red-gold hair gleaming as Aya smiled 
back. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t here earlier,&quot; Haruhi apologized gracefully, 
&quot;but I had a test I couldn&#39;t miss.&quot;

Aya chuckled softly as she swept her eyes across the other hosts, &quot;I 
understand, most of the others don&#39;t worry about that sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;I guess that&#39;s inconvenient to you,&quot; Haruhi conceded.

&quot;No,&quot; Aya reached out to take Haruhi&#39;s hand, &quot;I admire that a great 
deal. You came here based on your will and knowledge, not wealth and 
privilege.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Haruhi smiled warmly.

A blush colored Aya&#39;s cheeks as she murmured, &quot;You have the most lovely 
smile.&quot;

Haruhi looked away, giving her a moment to regain her composure. &quot;Do you 
want me to refresh your drink?&quot; Haruhi fell back on routine.

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Aya smiled gratefully.

They talked almost through the entire period, only separating 
reluctantly. &quot;I won&#39;t be here the rest of the day,&quot; Haruhi admitted as 
she walked Aya to the door, &quot;there&#39;s too many classes I can&#39;t miss. Will 
I see you tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Aya smiled, reaching out to take Haruhi&#39;s hand. &quot;I was 
wondering if you&#39;re busy after class? I&#39;d like to see you outside the 
Host Club,&quot; she said softly.

Haruhi met her eyes, knowing that it was wiser for her to refuse the 
offer, but... &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Haruhi found herself saying. They quickly 
arranged where to meet later, then Aya was gone in a swirl of her 
uniform skirt.

&quot;Our Haruhi has a date!&quot; Tamaki blurted when one of the other girl&#39;s 
passed the information on to him, his eyes wide. He suddenly hugged 
Haruhi close and swung her around as he cried, &quot;Daddy&#39;s little girl is 
growing up!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re no daddy of mine,&quot; Haruhi struggled free from his grip, &quot;and 
it&#39;s not a date, we&#39;re just having coffee.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s never just having coffee,&quot; Hikaru said with some amusement, his 
brother pouring them both some coffee.

&quot;Would you like some advice?&quot; Hunny asked eagerly, the boyish young man 
practically bouncing in place.

Haruhi blinked then smiled wryly, &quot;Sorry guys, but I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Kyoya raised a eyebrow, &quot;you&#39;re certain you can handle this all on 
your own, then?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Haruhi met his eyes, &quot;but Aya doesn&#39;t seem interested in 
the usual host club type.&quot; She smiled shyly, &quot;Why else would she pick 
me?&quot;

&quot;You might have a point,&quot; Tamaki admitted after a moment. He clapped 
Haruhi on the shoulder, nearly knocking her over as he said, &quot;Good 
luck!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to follow them, I take it?&quot; Kyoya said a few moments after 
Haruhi had left.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Tamaki smiled, &quot;we have to see what happens.&quot;

Haruhi waited at the gate, her uniform coat swirling in the fall breeze 
as she watched the crowd, largely unaware of the admiring gazes she got. 
Dressing as a boy took her already androgynous beauty up to the next 
level, turning her into a lovely hybrid of feminine and boyish looks.

&quot;Haruhi,&quot; Aya smiled as she emerged from the crowd, taking Haruhi&#39;s hand 
in hers as they walked away from the school. &quot;I was worried you wouldn&#39;t 
come,&quot; she admitted as they stood close together, Haruhi instinctively 
shielding Aya from the breeze, &quot;from listening to the other girl&#39;s I 
know you don&#39;t date a lot.&quot;

&quot;I said I would be here,&quot; Haruhi said, &quot;I meant it.&quot; She paused as 
something else registered, &quot;The girl&#39;s gossip about me?&quot;

&quot;You can be so naive,&quot; Aya laughed warmly. She looked over to meet her 
eyes, &quot;There are a lot of girls speculating about you, where you came 
from, and so much more.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know why,&quot; Haruhi admitted innocently.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s part of your charm,&quot; Aya snuggled close to her side.

They reached the nearby cafe and went inside, Aya unerringly leading 
them to a rear table. &#39;I&#39;m glad I just got my allowance,&#39; Haruhi gulped 
as she saw the price list. &quot;I&#39;ll get the first round,&quot; she offered 
bravely.

&quot;I asked you out, Haruhi,&quot; Aya smiled warmly, &quot;but thank you. I&#39;ll buy 
next.&quot;

They placed their orders with a waiter then Haruhi looked down and took 
a deep breath. She had been preparing to say this all night, but she 
still was nervous. &quot;There&#39;s something I have to tell you,&quot; she said 
softly.

&quot;I know,&quot; Aya reached out to squeeze Haruhi&#39;s hand, &quot;you&#39;re a girl.&quot;

&quot;You know?&quot; Haruhi squeaked. &quot;But why did you...?&quot;

Aya smiled shyly, &quot;Some women do prefer other women for company, you 
know.&quot; She peered at Haruhi, &quot;You look shocked.&quot;

&quot;Just surprised a bit,&quot; Haruhi smiled, feeling a odd kind of calm 
falling over her, &quot;I never really thought about this king of thing 
before.&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to go?&quot; Aya asked softly.

Haruhi squeezed Aya&#39;s hand back, &quot;No, please.&quot; A sudden smile, &quot;It may 
take me some time to get used to, though.&quot;

&quot;Take whatever time you need,&quot; Aya vowed.

From where they were gathered around a nearby table hiding behind their 
menus, the Host Club boys watched on in awe. &quot;Shoujo-ai in front of us,&quot; 
Tamaki sighed out dreamily, &quot;we should be filming this.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you still jealous?&quot; Kyoya noted mildly, sipping his coffee 
gracefully.

&quot;A bit,&quot; Tamaki conceded, &quot;but look at them!&quot; He sighed, little sparkles 
dancing around his face, &quot;It&#39;s just too romantic.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s cute,&quot; Hunny agreed.

Notes: This is loosely based off of the manga, and was originally going 
to feature some of the girls from the manga. However I haven&#39;t got 
enough of the mangas to see where the characters are going to go, so I 
made up a new lady for that purpose. I still want to see the anime, and 
may revise this story once I do.</pre>
