<h1>The Soul's Reflection</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lodoss/index.html">Record of Lodoss Wars</a>

<pre>	War.

	It&#39;s ripped our land apart so many times before and now it 
seems that it&#39;s about to do that once again. I know far too well it&#39;s a 
cycle we can never escape with Karla looming over our heads but this 
time it isn&#39;t of her doing.

	This time it&#39;s because he&#39;s returned.

	Ashram.

	The Dark Knight of Marmo. The greatest and only real enemy 
Parn has ever made in his life.

	I&#39;ve seen many sides to my beloved. I&#39;ve seen him gentle and 
I&#39;ve seen him playful. I&#39;ve even seen him bungling as an inefficient 
warrior.

	I&#39;ve seen all of him and I love each and every part.

	But Ashram, he brings out a different side to Parn. A side that 
even now I cannot get used to seeing. Just speaking of Ashram makes 
a gleam arise in his eyes.

	A gleam of hatred and passion at the same time.

	I wonder at that. The intensity Parn that feels for Ashram. It&#39;s 
as my mother told me so long ago...

	Every living thing has a reflection.

	Not a reflection like inside of a looking glass or when you look 
into a calm lake but a reflection of the soul.

	The soul&#39;s reflection.

	And I believe... no. I know that Ashram is Parn&#39;s.

	He is the dark half of my beloved. He is the childlike wonder 
gone too far. He is the dream out of control.

	He is what Parn could have become. Just as Parn is for 
Ashram. Their paths so different, yet so similar.

	None their equal, except one another. When they look into 
each others eyes they see that. They see the reflection.

	Their lives are so short next to mine.

	Mine and Pirotessa&#39;s.

	I cannot help but think of her when I think of Ashram. She is 
for him as I am for Parn. 

	The two of us became enemies because of our love for them. 
Our love for the reflections of the same mortal man.

	High elf, dark elf, what does it matter? We&#39;re all made of the 
same flesh. She knows that as well as I.

	We&#39;ve known each other for a long time. A chance meeting in 
the woods. An exchange of smiles and the danger felt at being with 
one considered the enemy.

	A brief love affair turned into a melding of souls only to have it 
be broken apart by elfin politics. Dark elf, high elf... 

	It sickens me to this very day. That is why I left my family and 
the council. Their ways cost me her love.

	Over the years we would meet again and again. Each meeting 
causing us to somehow rediscover that first time. That first love. That 
first chance meeting in the woods.

	Then we would part and go our own way. Knowing full well 
that we would soon meet again. 

	We know of our destiny and we know of our link so very little 
separates us. Even less than between Ashram and Parn. For we have 
so very much in common. Our magics, our beliefs, our choice in 
ambitious lovers.

	Ambition. It&#39;s a human quality.

	We elves don&#39;t have or seek it. Ambition becomes almost 
laughable with how long our lives can last.

	Perhaps that is why we seek ambition in humans. Choosing 
our favorites and furthering their ambition with our help. And through 
them, living the pure joy of it.

	Ashram&#39;s ambition nearly killed him and yet he returns. 
Seeking his goals once more. His ambition still driving him on.

	And Parn will try to stop him.

	The darkness meeting the light. The soul&#39;s reflection bumping 
up into each other to form an impasse.

	It comes, inevitable as death. I cannot do anything to stop the 
future from unraveling as it would choose but I can help Parn in his 
quest to stop Ashram&#39;s ambition.

	I cannot help but wonder...

	Will she be there too? Returned from the dead just as Ashram 
has done? Standing at his side with her silver hair glinting in the 
moonlight and that heady aura of danger surrounding her?

	Pirotessa.

	We are reflections, she and I. Unlike Ashram and Parn we 
know this to be true and we accept it and each other.

	Long after the years have passed and our love&#39;s and their 
ambitions have faded away we will still be here. We will still have each 
other. Our soul&#39;s reflection.

	And our eternal love with it.

-End-

The character of Deedlit is from Record of the Lodoss War: 
Chronicles of the Heroic Knight. I just finished watching the first video 
of the new Lodoss series and it was great! I love this series and all the 
characters. In particular the four that were mentioned here. In an odd 
way they really do have a lot in common and I wanted to show that. 
Plus I&#39;ve always liked the idea of Deedlit with Pirotessa. Yeah, I&#39;m a 
dork.
