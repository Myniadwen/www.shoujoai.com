<h2>a <a href="../lodoss/index.html">Record of Lodoss Wars</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/harumoto.html">Harumoto</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lodoss/nobounds-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Notes: Not quite sure how to say that this is the end. But it is so.. 
yeah okay so here it is the rest of it.  Bye the way I don&#39;t think they 
ever tell you who&#39;s body Karla has taken over in the second half of the 
series do they? Well anyhow, I&#39;ll figure something out.

Thoughts = &gt;&lt;

Leylia pulled the straps away from the body, she was able to reveal the 
white skin underneath it. Leylia was able to get the black robs off of 
Karla quite easily to her surprise. The body Karla had inhabited was 
quite close to her original form from years gone bye.

Leylia was hoping that Karla didn&#39;t catch on to her tactic. Which was to 
get Karla to use up powers leaving her circlet unprotected. Karla leaned 
forward allowing her long black hair to fall around Leylia. There bodies 
touched, Leylia couldn&#39;t reject.

Karla eyes were usually filled with nothing in them. Her eyes were 
usually like water just reflecting back never allowing one to see in to 
her self. But now they seamed to have something there. &gt;I wonder? What 
she&#39;s.. no I must keep to my mission which is to rid the world of her! 
But.. I.. I.. I can&#39;t..&lt; Leylia found her self kissing the one woman 
that had taken over her hole bean once.

Leylia now tried to turn the tied she rolled on top of the dark 
sorceress. Leylia knew she might not know how this body under her worked 
but she knew what she liked, she was willing to try anything at this 
point to get Karla&#39;s soul out of this body.

Leylia now kissed down the nape of Karla&#39;s neck, letting a bit hit here 
and there. For Leylia it seamed that Karla was very hard Karla held in 
any moan that might have slipped out. It seamed that Karla was better at 
being a lover then being made love to.

Leylia continued to the breast, Leylia now took both breast with her 
hands and pushed the nibbles together. Leylia took both in to her mouth, 
she hard Karla take in a breath. Karla might not moan at the slightest 
touch like Leylia but she could hold it in for long.

Leylia liked the nubs and bit down not hard but just enough so that 
Karla could feel it. Leylia pulled at them as one, Karla&#39;s back slowly 
arched but she didn&#39;t make any noise. Leylia was starting to wonder if 
Karla was biting her lips.

Leylia let go of the breast she then slowly slid down Karla&#39;s body. 
&gt;here goes nothing..&lt; Leylia thought to her self she ventured down 
between Karla&#39;s thighs. Leylia did what she knew was the unthinkable, 
she pressed her hand down in to Karla&#39;s clit.

Leylia placed two of her fingers in to it, Karla let out a low moan it 
wasn&#39;t loud but Leylia still heard it. Leylia began to pump her fingers 
in and out of Karla&#39;s pussy harder and faster. Karla&#39;s inter back was 
now arching, she was off the bed now.

Leylia knew that it wouldn&#39;t take to long now Karla screamed but she 
covered her mouth with her hands. Her juices spilled from her pussy 
Leylia knew that this was it. Now or never, Karla was lying down full on 
to the bed her body still recovering.

Leylia came face to face with Karla &quot;Goodbye.&quot; she said as she kissed 
Karla on the lips. Leylia placed her hand on the circlet, Karla screamed 
as her soul was ripped from her host. Leylia closed her eyes the scream 
was torture to her she had become to know and love the haft crazed 
sorceress. Even if her ideals were to balance out the power between good 
and evil. Leylia sat up on the bed she saw a stool by the bed, she 
placed the circlet gently on to it.

Once she had done that Leylia knew that the hole ordeal was over. Marmo 
was gone. And with Karla gone there was no one left to put Lodoss in to 
danger ever again. Leylia lied down on to the bed she pulled the hair 
out of the woman&#39;s face. Leylia knew that she would have to explain 
everything. Not to just her but to Slain and everyone else waiting for 
her safe return.

Leylia fell asleep knowing that lodoss was safe once more. The circlet 
sat on the stool, it started to glow slightly as Karla&#39;s powers return 
to there full strength.

To be continued..??

Next time on Record of Lodoss war:
Leylia returns with the unknown woman and reviles that Karla is no mare. 
But with a new Marmo arising and a new general at its front. Does this 
mean Karla&#39;s behind it? An does this new Marmo intend to take over all 
of Lodoss? Find out next time on Record of Lodoss war. The New Marmo

Notes: Uh.. yep you knew it, I knew it, we all knew it. and for those 
who didn&#39;t guess it.. well I&#39;m sorry.  Oh and bye the way I hope I don&#39;t 
screw this up. and if I do I&#39;m sorry. and if I don&#39;t well I&#39;m still 
sorry.</pre>
