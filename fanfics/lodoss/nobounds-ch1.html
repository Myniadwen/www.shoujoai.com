Spark &quot;Split up!&quot; Slain &quot;You take Vognard we&#39;ll handle Karla.&quot; Spark along
with Leaf, Rina and Godric move in on Vodgnard who has captured a priestess
and is using her as a sacrifice to Cardess.

***

Leylia along with Slain, Deedlit and Parn, run up to the steps to the
second floor. Were Karla is chanting her side of the spell. Leylia reaches
the top first &quot;Karla!&quot; she yells but her voice has a gentleness to it.
Karla turns at the sound of her name, this cased her to stop chanting.

Leylia &quot;Karla, please stop this, Karla please. I know this isn&#39;t right and
I know that you feel the same way.&quot; Karla pauses thinking about Leylia. she
and her were the same person so many before this. Karla had taken over many
people, yet Leylia was the only one who broke her spell. Karla knew every
inch of Leylia&#39;s body, she also knew what Leylia did when she was alone.
Leylia would never tell her mother what she did, her mother would kill her.
Leylia took a step forward seeing Karla was obviously cough up in her
thoughts.

Karla snapped back to reality she saw that Leylia was closer. Karla could
use her magic to push her away or capture them. She did neither, Karla took
Leylia&#39;s wrist and pulled Leylia towards her.

Slain &quot;Let her go Karla!&quot; Parn stood in shock he had no idea what Karla had
planed but he could guess it. &quot;Karla? Karla what are you doing?&quot; Leylia
asked some how remaining calm. Karla pressed her index finger to Leylia&#39;s
lips, she replaced her finger with her lips. Leylia&#39;s heart just about
stopped, Slain&#39;s nose started to bleed along with Parn&#39;s.

The spell that held the girl broke, Vognard turned up to see what Karla was
doing. Spotting her kissing Leylia he promptly fell over.

Karla continued to kiss Leylia for a while then she thought of an idea, why
not take Leylia away with her? She had a castle and everything she knew
every spot on Leylia&#39;s body that would make her, her&#39;s.

Karla removed her lips only long enough to cast a transporting spell, the
two disappeared in to the floor. Leaving Slain and Parn with bleeding
noses, Deedlit hadn&#39;t reacted fast enough to do anything.

Leylia saw darkness one moment and fire light the next, she looked around
for only a moment as she took in the room around her. She recognized it,
she was in Karla&#39;s castle she remembered it from when she was there.

&quot;Why am I Mmm?&quot; Leylia was cut off do to the fact that Karla had kissed her
again. Leylia felt Karla&#39;s hands travel across her chest to her breast,
felling Karla&#39;s hands hit a sensitive area Leylia shook lightly. Karla
feeling the reaction she enjoyed it, being in a body was one thing but
being able to know every peace of it was just making her drool.

Leylia felt Karla move her mouth away from hers, Karla may not of had her
real body but her host body was just as good. Karla knew that Leylia
wouldn&#39;t back down, Leylia was married yes but she knew that two woman
can&#39;t make a child together. Karla was willing to take a change to do the
impossible with Leylia whether she knew it or not.

Leylia slowly gave in to Karla, Karla kissed along the nap of Leylia&#39;s neck
making sure to hit every nerve that would send the best sensation threw the
priestess&#39;s body. Leylia shook lightly under every kiss, Karla slowly
pushed Leylia on to the bed. Karla slowly moved her weight on to Leylia
making sure not to hurt her in any way shape or form.

Leylia bit down on her lower lip hoping to hold back any moans that might
try to pass her lips. Karla&#39;s hands clamped down squishing the two mounds
underneath them. Leylia felt her back arch she was giving in, Karla moved
one of her hands away only to open up the white priestess robe. Leylia felt
the cloth slip away, she shook when the cold air touched her body.

Karla&#39;s hands now could come in contact with the skin under it, &gt;I.. I must
get the circlet off her forehead. But how? and when she&#39;s...Oh Marfa
forgive me..&lt; she let out a slight moan. Continued to work gently on
Leylia&#39;s breast, she then let one hand go down. Karla let her hand lightly
touch Leylia&#39;s stomach hitting every spot that made Leylia moan lightly.

Karla placed her hand near the closes part near Leylia&#39;s woman hood, Karla
could feel the sex between her legs become hot. She knew the feeling but
she hadn&#39;t felt it for a long time. Karla slid her hands down Leylia&#39;s
thigh first trying to get a good feel of her leg. Leylia felt her body heat
up with electricity and she wanted Karla to continue. Karla almost read her
mind as she continued she slowly placed her hand against Leylia&#39;s sex.
Leylia lightly moaned Karla&#39;s name out loud, Karla felt Leylia rub against
her hand. She enjoyed the sensation she lowered her lips to Leylia&#39;s right
breast. She lightly placed her lips against the now hardening nub. Leylia&#39;s
body was held in suspense when Karla&#39;s lips hit her breast. She threw her
head back &quot;Karla!&quot; Leylia yelled out, Karla sucked lightly Leylia&#39;s nipple
harden under the light touch. Karla pulled away, Leylia moaned lightly as
if in protest. Karla met this with a light flick of her tong, Leylia let
out a moan this time louder. Karla let her hand just press against Leylia&#39;s
sex she didn&#39;t place her fingers in to Leylia, she let Leylia rub against
her hand. Karla then gently bit down on to the now harden nub, Leylia could
believe it Karla was excellent at making her body want her more and more.

Karla tugged gently almost effortlessly she then pulled away also pulling
at the soft skin of her partner. Leylia moaned at this, Karla slowly
maneuvered to the other breast. Leylia&#39;s mind started to run again &gt;Maybe
if I get her tired enough I can just simply remove the circlet from her
forehead. It might take awhile but it&#39;s my only chance.&lt; Karla placed her
lips on to the left breast doing the same to it as she had with the right.
Leylia moaned she found her own hands she pulled at the black cloak that
hugged Karla&#39;s body.

Karla feeling the light tug she pulled away from her spot and looked up at
Leylia. Leylia placed her hand on the naught that held the black cloak in
place. She pulled lightly at it, once it had come undone she let the cloak
slide to the floor. She now could see the body that had been hiding
underneath it. The black robes of a sorceress were still on Karla&#39;s body
the top was held in place with straps.
