<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Yaya: My lingering pains</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  heart was still frantically beating even after I had closed the dorm  room behind myself. Tossing the notebook somewhere, I rushed to get a  fresh set of clothes and a towel. Along I brought an unused bandage  and some disinfectant that the nurse gave me for my cut. I then  walked into the bathroom, turning on the shower after I had unwrapped  the old bandage on my wrist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself recollecting most of the day with Tsubomi-chan. I  particularly found my mind lingering about what had happened just a  few minutes ago…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had just asked Tsubomi to go out with me again sometime. I felt my  heart racing happily as she agreed, blushing as she nodded. Then I  found myself doing something unexpected… I cupped her face gently  with my hands soon after I had slipped my notebook into the bag.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>A  good first date deserves a kiss right?’</em> I thought… She looked surprised at the touch. And I could see her  blush deepen a few tones as I brought myself closer to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Her  lips look quite delicious right now…’</em> I drew closer slightly…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  eyes softly closed, she seemed to have realized my intent and decided  to make it romantic…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ten  inches… nine inches… eight inches… seven… I found myself  pausing my advance…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>This  isn’t right… Tsubomi-chan likes Hikari. Sure she has even less  chances of getting her than I do… but that’s really not the point  is it?’</em> I examined her  face, <em>‘she’s waiting  for me to kiss her… I want to kiss her… But no matter how cute  she is, how easy she is to figure out and play with… she’s not  Hikari is she… this isn’t love. Not for either of us. We sort of…  caught each other in the rebounded of love.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  resumed my approach, softly turning her face ever so slightly, before  quickly wrapping my arms around her. She gasped softly to my touch  and slightly jumped at the light but audible sound of my lips swiftly  kissing her cheek. She let out a low sigh of disappointment but  returned the hug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Thank  you Tsubomi. And for now… I’m sorry.’</em> I know she couldn’t possibly have heard me. But at least, hopefully  with the hug I could somehow pass the message in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  hug ended after a few minutes. I confidently recall pulling away. I  could tell I was blushing as badly as she was, I did not need to see  of feel my face to tell that I was, the incredibly fast beating of my  heart was more than enough to inform me of it. I quickly picked up my  notebook from the bag before handing it to her. I smiled and wave as  I turned to the door and opened it and waved goodbye. Not looking  back, thinking that if I did I would have run back into her arms and  kissed her right there and then, Kami-sama knows I need it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  stinging of my wrist brought me back from re-collective daydream. <em>‘I  probably stayed too long.’</em> I quickly dried off, a few drops of blood found it’s way on my  towel but it was fine… it’s not as bad as yesterday’s bleeding.  I had heard Hikari over the door, but I couldn’t really respond.  Carefully I used the disinfectant on the wound before wrapping my  wrist in the fresh bandage. I then slipped on to a fresh batch of  clothes, which consisted of a red tank top and blue jean shorts,  before binding the towel on my long still very moist hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  I walked out of the bath I found Hikari standing a little  suspiciously in the middle of the room. I smiled and waved at her,  and walked over and sat on my bed where my notebook was. I opened it  and wrote: <em><u>“Welcome  Back Hikari. How was your day?”</u></em> showed her and kept smiling while my mind began thinking. <em>‘She  came in minutes after I did. I wonder if she saw us… I hoped not.  It was a good thing that I didn’t go thru with the kiss… who  knows how long it could have lasted.’</em> I tried my best not to look the least bit guilty. And so far I think  I could control it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  talked about her date… she seemed to have had quite some fun. She  had mention that she was in town too. I feared that she might have  seen me with Tsubomi already and she’s just not telling me yet. I  was really nervous about it. I’m quite sure my legs were shaking  and I was doing some odd gestures with my hand that I can’t quite  remember. She didn’t seem to notice, or she didn’t mention it if  she did… I hoped it was the first.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thankfully  she made no mention of seeing me… she asked where I went. I told  her; <em><u>“I went to the  hospital for my appointment, walked around town, a local café,  to a movie, walked around town some more before going back to the  dorms.”</u></em> I kept out  the fact that I had Tsubomi accompany me most of the day. I wasn’t  lying… Technically speaking, after all everything I’ve told her  was the truth. I just kept it simple and the fact is she only asked  me where I went not what I did there and who I was with at the time.  So yeah technically I’m not lying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  talked a bit, she talked about the movie she and Ootori had seen a  while ago. She seemed happy about their relationship, I’ll try not  to spoil things for them. I told her I watched the horror movie. She  commented about not coincidentally meeting each other there. I  laughed silently, but deep inside I was glad we didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then remembered that I still had a lot of work to do, so I told her  that I should get to work so I could catch up with the rest of the  class. She nodded and offered to make me some tea, I could only nod  and smile to accept and thank her offer. She seemed to be getting  used to us talking like this…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  taking off the wet towel that wrapped around my hair and setting it  among my other laundry. I began taking out some notebooks and  textbooks from my book bag. I set them out in an order of favorite  and easy subjects first so that I could be done with them quickly and  move to the least favorite and harder subjects. I was just about to  finish the easiest subject when Hikari came back with steaming cup of  Earl Grey tea and a small saucer of sweet butter biscuits. I smiled  and thanked her, writing that I was feeling hungry just about now and  that this should help me last till dinner time. She smiled, just sat  on my bed for a bit while I returned my attention to studying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was writing my English speech essay when I noticed that Hikari seemed  to be in a daze… I ignored it for now. Maybe she’s just thinking.  When I was done with my essay I moved on to math. Again I noticed  that Hikari still seemed to be in a daze and was staring at me. I  took the time to take a sip of the now slightly warm tea and eat some  of the sweet butter biscuits while sparingly watching her from the  corner of my eyes. I resumed my studying noting to myself that I  should take the time and check if she was watching me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By  the time I was just about done with most of my work I had learned  that she had stared at me the whole time. From the way I wrote, to  drinking tea, to eating the biscuits, to stifling a yawn… ‘What  is she up to?’ I thought. I guess this is how a gold fish feels. I  know I tend to look at her a lot too but I don’t stare at her like  this… well not since a long… long… long time ago… It was then  that a thought popped into my head. I could tease her a bit… Maybe  even stir her unconscious desire for me… I tried to hold back a  mischievous internal laugh as well as the real one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  closed the last text and note books softly and opened my special  notebook and stared back at her. She didn’t seem to notice yet. So  I decided to wait until she does. A few minutes later… she blinked  several times. I took it as my cute as to have realized that I was  staring back at her. I wrote; <em><u>“Hikari…  why were you staring at me?”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  inched back a bit, clearly caught of guard and wasn’t ready to be  teased, though I have to note that she looked a little happy. She  began to stutter out words, some that didn’t make sense… like  random syllables stuck together. “I… uhh… umm…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Oh  my… She’s just so cute… she was blushing, stuttering, and  seemed completely oblivious that I was teasing her. <em>‘And  I’ve just began.’</em> Or  so I thought. I had intended to tease her about it wasn’t to late  if she wanted to be my girl, she had just began going out with Ootori  anyway. But what I was thinking was so far off from what I wrote  down…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>“</u><em><u>You  have Ootori-sama now. She’s pretty big catch, you most likely  wouldn’t need to cheat. But if you did you really shouldn’t go  for someone like me.”</u></em> I quickly showed it to her… and regretted it.  It was bad enough that she was Ootori’s… And now I just sealed  it. I didn’t know what made me write that… my first guess is  guilt that still lingered after stealing her first kiss. That or I  was guilty of cheating on her, sure I mean we weren’t together…  but technically I cheated on my love for her by going with Tsubomi  today. Dozens of thoughts quickly passed thru my head… my smile was  still there but was neither of mischief nor happiness, it was a fake  smile that I had learned to held to hide how I really felt hundreds  and thousands of times before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then Hikari suddenly said in a loud shaky voice; “How  can you say that! Yaya-chan you’re special to me too! You’re…  you’re…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honestly…  I was shocked. I knew that Hikari was a nice and sweet girl. Deep  inside me I know that she had already forgiven me for what I’ve  done over a week ago. But one thing that I thought I’d never be for  Hikari was someone special. Sure I was her best friend, but I  believed that someone could have taken my place… someone else could  have been her best friend and treated her just like I had during the  past year.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  smile I had forced slowly melted… I looked straight at her she was  slightly shaking like she was going to cry at any time now. I was  happy beyond words… had I not been mute at the moment I’d  probably be stuttering her name right now. I wrote; <em><u>“Thank  you… Hikari.”</u></em> I  failed to notice when I smiled… but it felt right.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  soon as she glanced on the paper, Hikari launched herself from my bed  and headed right at me. I let go of the notebook, dropping it to the  floor, thinking it would hurt one or both of us if it stays in the  way. She wraps her arms around my waist and buries her face on my  tummy. She was crying, I could hear her softly sobbing and I could  feel her tears on my skin moistening the thin fabric of my red tank  top. I allowed one of my hands to slowly brush her hair soft blonde  brown hair while using my other hand to wipe of a tear drop that  threatened to fall, but this felt right… being with Hikari like  this. I know it’s a selfish dream, to want her for myself… but I  guess that’s what it means to love. But letting go of something you  love is also love. And right now… the one I love is someone I  should let go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>But  for now, I’m going to cherish this moment for all it’s worth.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Neither  of us moved much. The only sounds that could be heard in the room was  Hikari’s soft sobbing which had died down a few notches over the  pass half hour, some small sniffles from both of us and my hand  brushing her hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I’m  sorry Hikari… for making you cry again.’</em> I truly felt sorry for what I did… and growing more guilty of  something else. What if she does fall for me? Sure I’d love that  but… she still loves Amane… then this would be very painful…  for both of us and possibly the third party, Amane. I’d rather  suffer this lost love alone rather than sharing it with her. Hikari  shouldn’t go thru that. I don’t think her sweet and sensitive  heart can take that kind of pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  continued to slowly brush her hair with my hand, cherishing what  could possibly the last time I would hold her this close and  familiarly. Promising myself… <em>‘For  Hikari… this will be the last time.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  slowly stirred up, her arms slowly withdrawing, setting them on her  lap… And just in time as well. I was starting to fear my resolve to  uphold the promise I made to myself was crumbling. She looked up at  me with her slightly redden eyes that looked a bit puffed up, nothing  cool water and a short amount of rest wouldn’t solve. She was  smiling, I couldn’t come up with any reason as to why… but she is  still very, very cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan…”  she gently whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  tilted my head slightly to acknowledge her soft call. <u>“Yes?”</u> I said with my lips. And for what seemed like forever… she just  stared at me with the soft smile in her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Our  moment of serenity was cut short when a very audible knock came from  our room’s door. Snapping out of her serene daze Hikari turns away  from me, with a tiny blush from her face. “Yes, I’m coming.”  She stood as she answered the door rising from the now warm spot on  the floor which held her delicate body this passed hour.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  could say that I was a little saddened that our little moment was  interrupted. But I was also very much relieved. <u>‘Hikari…  I will try to be strong, for both of us.</u>’  She didn’t see it nor did she need to. It was another promise to  myself. A difficult and painful one…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  watched Hikari answer the door. I couldn’t see who it was yet, but  my guess was one of our juniors or someone from the choir. It was  rare that our classmates would visit our room. But then again it  could be Nagisa-chan and Tamao-san or even Tsubomi but seeing her  here would be a little unlikely after what happened hours ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  Evening Sempai. This is Nanto-Onee-… Nanto-sempai’s room am I  correct?” said the visitor, I was sure she almost used ‘Onee-sama’  after my name. I leaned on my chair to get a better view of the  person by the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes  it is.” Said Hikari, her voice was polite yet somehow I picked up a  tiny hint of what seemed to be annoyance in her voice. But I could be  wrong… No! I have to be! Hikari isn’t like me. I laughed inwardly  at the insulting feeling from the comment I gave myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  package was delivered for her just now. Sister Mamasaka asked me to  call her to pick it up in her office.” said the girl outside the  door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Package?’</em> I thought for a moment… <em>‘I  mom would have sent a letter or called if she sent… OH!’</em> I then remembered all those I items I bought from the art supply  store a while ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Quickly  picking up my notebook and wrote a few words of gratitude to the  messenger, who blushed as she saw me. She stiffened and stood  straight and quickly said “Th-that wi-wii-will beeeeall.  Th-th-thank youforyourtime.” She stuttered quite a lot and bowed  and turned bowing hitting her head on the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“OW…”  she rubbed her head for a short moment and blushed even harder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Ouch…  that had to hurt.’</em> I  thought as I moved over to Hikari’s side, who just stood there. I  didn’t have time to look at Hikari’s expression, I was worried  about the silly and nervous blue haired junior who was kneeling on  the floor holding her head in pain gargling an odd mix of ahs and  ows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  knelt in front of the young girl and gently placed my hand on her  chin, which resulted into a almost loud, nervous, squealing gasp from  said junior. With my other hand, I took hold of her hand that was  covering the bump on her head and set it out of the way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Onee-sama?...”  She blushed harder which made me smile quite broadly inside. <em>‘She  did want to say sama… hehehe. I think my head is getting big. I  guess this is what most Miator students feel after being called  Onee-sama. hahaha…’</em> I  couldn’t believe how happy I felt from just that… maybe I’m in  the wrong school.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  the same hand I gently checked her head for any signs of an open  wound, taking great care not to let her feel any pressure from my  hand. Seeing none I gave her a soft smile while patting her shoulder  then quickly wrote: <em><u>“There  isn’t any cut. You should get some ice for that before it gets  swollen.”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  just stared at me for a moment, her blush changing to an even darker  hue. “Y-y-yes… I wi-will… Th-thank you.” Her stuttering was  cute. I had often liked walking around the campus looking for girls  like her to tease before I had met Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bowing  properly this time she said goodbye and walked down the hall heading  down even though see seemed stiffly nervous. Come to think of it…  It was almost dinner time, I had better get those packages. I closed  the door to find Hikari just standing there staring at the door in  one of her dazes. Usually I’d tease her about it right now. But  it’s such a hard task now, not that I should tease her anymore.  Especially after that mishap just an a while ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wrote: <em><u>“I’ll be  heading to Sister Mamasaka’s office to pick up my package or  packages.”</u></em> and  waved the notebook in front of her to get her to snap out of her  daze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  backed away from it a bit an act I’m quite sure was an instinct of  caution and dodge the notebook from hitting her face. It wasn’t  until she saw the contents of the page did she have any real  reaction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!  I’ll come with you. Incase you need help.” She said which I  nodded to as I opened the door for us. If I had my voice I’d tell  her I could handle it on my own. I bet she had figured it was heavy  or there was a lot… probably because if it wasn’t the messenger  could have just brought it with her. I didn’t bother arguing with  Hikari. Instead I decided to relish what time together we could have.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  picked up my packages from the sister’s office by the entrance of  the dorm. Now that I had actually bought them did I realize that  there was a lot, compared to how I looked at them before and after  paying. But oh well!... I let Hikari carry the lighter ones which I  assume was the sketchbooks, some paint and brushes. We carried them  up to our room. She later found out what was inside the packages and  asked why I had bought a lot of them. I answered that I had always  wanted to try taking up painting and that now seemed like a good  chance to get on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  all that, the two of us headed down for dinner. Tsubomi ate beside us  and was unusually noisy, which I deemed she was either extremely  nervous being near me after I had hugged and kissed her cheek a few  hours ago or she was making up for what noise I couldn’t make  thanks to my current condition… but right now I’m not quite sure  which one of the two I’d like better. Hikari seemed quiet then,  more than usual at least… I’m beginning to wonder what was wrong.  Unfortunately maybe it’s best that I sit back for now and deal with  it when she needs me. Now isn’t exactly the best time for me and  her to have a heart to heart talk. I’m quite sure my resolve to  keep my hands off her isn’t strong as I want it to be yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dinner  ended without incident. I’m not counting Tsubomi’s unusually  noisiness, Hikari’s silence and the unshakable feeling that some  girls were watching me… Yes… more than one. I could oddly  distinctly feel Ootori’s gaze, I don’t know why but her stare  felt different… if I have to describe it, it feels… ‘manly.’  The others felt like curiosity, I’d bet a lot of them were  wondering if it’s true that I had lost my voice… too bad it’s  not easily proven.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  headed back up to our room after eating. Hikari had immediately  decided to take a bath before bed time. I on the other hand had  nothing to do now that I had somehow finished my homework already. So  instead I proceeded to organize the art supplies that I had bought. I  decided to keep the paints, canvas and easel inside its box for now.  It was too late at night to start painting anyway. I started  sketching, anything that came to mind… anything except Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Hikari exited the bath, I had to pinch myself to not stare. She’s  just too beautiful. She wore one of her soft yellow colored pajamas,  it was a little on the childish side… but it was her unique charm  that made her even more beautiful… it’s almost a crime to look at  her and not to look at her. And I’m not quite sure which one I’d  rather be in for. She sat down on her bed after plugging her  hairdryer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had filled a few pages with some random drawings. Some animals,  plants and even our door, this was mainly trying to test how well I  can still draw since I haven’t drawn seriously since enrolling here  in this school. Not that I didn’t want to draw anymore… lets just  say I was too preoccupied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  checked the clock and saw it was getting late. I closed my sketchbook  and opened my notebook then wrote; <em><u>“It’s  getting late, I’m going to sleep ok? Good Night Hikari.”</u></em> and showed it to her. To which she nodded and began to clear her  things. Especially the hair dryer she had used just moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  no time we were both in bed with only the lamp on her side of the  room that is still left on. “I’ll turn off the lights, alright?”  she didn’t have to ask really, but I smiled and nodded anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Laying  back on my bed, covered by a thin breathing blanket and my soft  pillow on my head I found myself slowly drifting of to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“an…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“ya-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“yaya-chan”  I slowly opened my eyes upon realizing that I was in fact hearing a  familiar soft voice of my roommate and not groggily dreaming of her.  She was kneeling beside my bed, shaking my arm which was still  underneath my blanket. What time it was didn’t matter really,  though I’m sure had I had my voice I’d ask her by now. I sat up  and turn on the lamp on my side of the bed and almost reached for my  notebook but her hand stopped me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan…”  She looked at me while hugging her pillow in one hand… with her  slightly teary eyes, her voice shook in fear of something which was  obvious to me now that I noticed the hand that held mine was shaking.  “…I had a very scary nightmare. Would it be alright if I slept  beside you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  mind went blank for a second… this wasn’t the best thing for me.  But my protective instincts for Hikari kicked in and I found myself  nodding and scooting over to one side of the bed making space for her  with me in my single bed. She got on the bed and under the now shared  blanket after placing her pillow beside mine. She turned the lights  off for me as soon as she was ready. While I on the other hand turned  towards the wall and tried to sleep on my side with my back behind  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was nervous… had Ootori not been part of this love equation, this  sleeping together would be a very welcome request from Hikari and  possibly a chance to look good for Hikari. But now this was torment  for so many reasons.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan?”  I stirred and turned my head enough to see her. “Could you face  this way?... please?” she pleaded. She looked for vulnerable right  now. I could say the same for my resolve and sanity… but I suppose  I should do as she wants, she’d probably suspect and worry about me  if I refuse. Not to mention she would most likely be saddened if I  decided not to do as she asks. So I turned to face her and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you! Yaya-chan.” She said as she suddenly places one hand over my  waist while the other took hold of right hand. I was surprised about  it and couldn’t help but stiffen to the touch. She had her eyes  closed already, and started to drift into sleep. I on the other hand  had a little trouble doing so… It’s not that I didn’t like  sleeping with Hikari. I’ve dreamed of this quite a few times  before. But now that it had actually and that I couldn’t really do  anything else but actually sleep… made me a little depressed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was another reason that sleep didn’t seem so easy. It seems that  Hikari while asleep possessed rather… active hands. Her right hand  which was on and half way on bottom from my waist, and was tracing  the garter of my panties in the most enticing and mind numbing ways.  I told myself I should probably warn Ootori about it if I ever  forgive her, but even if I don’t she’ll find out anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had taken her hand off my bottom quite few times, only for it to  return a few minutes later. ‘I’ll never get to sleep.’ Sure  maybe I was exaggerating a bit, after all given different  circumstances… this would be heavenly. And not falling a sleep for  a while would be a small price to pay to have her like this at my  side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  could feel my body warm up to her unconscious ‘attention’. I  could feel my cheeks warm up so much I felt dizzy, my nether regions  were feeling quite warm and moist, had I not been mute I swear I  would be moaning quite loudly right now… I didn’t realize I was  so sensitive to sensual touch. I was beginning to fear where this  would lead. But thankfully I soon drifted into a deep sleep before my  mind went crazy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  next day… I felt something incredibly warm and slightly heavy on  myself. I wanted to open my eyes, but felt so tired I decided not to  mind whatever it was that was so close and warm. I slowly came to  realize that this warm thing had spread it’s influence and was  directly touching my skin. A minute later I realize those ‘influence’  where arms and they were under my tank top and gently cupped the  sides of my breasts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan”  Upon hearing my name, my eyes flew open in surprise and saw Hikari  lying on top of myself with her hands under my tank top. Which by the  way made me blush so hard. I screamed out of instinct and surprise.  But of course it wasn’t any good, after all I had no voice right  now... a fact that I failed to remember at that moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  calmed down after a few seconds of pointless silent screaming. Hikari  wasn’t really a very heavy sleeper, but she’s not easy to wake up  either if she doesn’t feel like waking. “Yaya-chan… that  tickles…” she mumbled in her sleep. Something I didn’t expect  from her but it is cute. <em>‘I  wonder what she’s dreaming of right now…’</em> I found my mind wandering for a bit. It was Sunday morning, Hikari  liked sleeping in on Sundays. A fact that made me dread the long  possible time I’d have to spend underneath her this morning. Not  wanting to go insane, I decided to slip away from under her and  setting her gently down on the bed before tucking her in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  bath seemed tempting right now, but as soon as I was out of the bed  and away from Hikari’s grasp the room’s air felt a little cold.  It was still dark, probably before sunrise… which for some reason I  wanted to watch this morning. I took out a blue jean jacket, that  just happened to match my shorts, from my dresser and put it on over  my top. I picked up my notebook and exited the room quietly after  leaving a short note for Hikari in case she wakes up early.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Outside  was even colder enough to make me wish I had worn pants instead, but  I didn’t let the temperature bother me too much. It was still dark  and I was surprised to see quite a few students up and about already.  What made it even stranger was because it was a Sunday. Then again  some people are stricter about their daily routine than most. From  where I stood I could see a few girls joggling around the dorm’s  property together. In another spot I found some girls carrying  bokkens and shinais, most likely they members of the kendo club.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One  girl caught my eye for a moment, she was the girl that passed the  message about my packages last night. She was being taught by the  tall black haired girl in the white and red hakama. She’s quite  famous and cool in her own way, but not enough to rival ‘the  prince’ and the current etoile. I was watching for a while, I then  noticed that the girl from yesterday suddenly froze and didn’t  move… it took me a while to notice that she was looking at my  direction. I turned around to see if anyone else was there but found  no body. <em>‘Oh don’t  tell me… I actually have fans around here…’</em> I found myself mentally kicking myself for forgetting the not so  subtle hint from her when she called me ‘onee-sama’ last night. <em>‘Oh well…’</em> I decided to smile and wave at her, which caused her to blush and  trip on her own feet and soon was being scolded by the tall girl  beside her. I couldn’t help but giggle as I made my approach  thinking ‘might as well cheer her up.’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wrote; <em><u>“How is your  bump from yesterday?”</u></em> as I walked. I showed the notebook to her when I got near enough. The  taller girl didn’t seem to mind me talking to her student. Instead  she placed her bokken’s end down on the ground and held it like a  cane while watching us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  smaller girl stuttered for a while… slowly spitting out words that  made no sense for the first few seconds. “Iiiit’s fine nona-now.  Th-thank you…” I couldn’t help but smile… that was just too  cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then wrote; <em><u>“I see.  Good luck with you training then. Work hard alright?!”</u></em> and showed it to her, patting her head lightly as I continued to  smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ye-YES!  Thank you very much!” She happily and proudly replied almost  without stuttering. I turned to her dark haired trainer, who seemed  happy for her student’s reborn determination. She bowed to me and  mouthed a <u>“Thank you”</u> with out a voice, I assumed this to thank me with out the other girl  hearing it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  bowed to them and waved before taking my leave. I decided to walk  around the dorm area to look for a good spot to watch the sun rinse.  I felt someone else watching me from behind, her presence was getting  closer which I didn’t want. Without turning around to see her, I  continued to walk hoping that she’ll take a hint and stay away for  now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I’m  sorry Ootori. I don’t want to talk to you unless I really have to…’</em></span></p>
