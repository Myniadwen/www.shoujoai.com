fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ninemil.html">ninemil</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Inwardly, Hikari had been dreading the return to lessons.

On top of the already exhausting social duties, the slowly growing mound 
of paperwork which the school council representatives had been feeding 
Amane and herself for processing, and the endless uncomfortable public 
appearances, Hikari now worried her newly attained title would interfere 
with her schooling directly, fearing the effect it would have on the 
relationship she shared with her classmates and teachers. She found 
class intimidating enough at times, let alone under these new 
circumstances.

Sighing, she gazed up at the bright morning sky as she walked to the 
dormitory gates, clutching her brown satchel protectively. If only she 
could be Etoile when, and only when she were beside Amane-senpai. The 
world was so much easier to deal with when they were together.

With dismay, her sullen blue eyes searched but failed to spot Yaya at 
the gate, and she slowed her pace as she approached it. Instead, a 
throng of adoring first and second years stood waiting to offer the 
Etoile their arm for the journey to class. A musical chorus of well 
wishes greeted her as she drew near.

&quot;Good morning Etoile.&quot; &quot;Can I accompany you to class?&quot; &quot;How are you 
today?&quot; &quot;Is Amane-sama not with you?&quot;

Smiling politely, she returned the greetings and declined the offers, 
explaining that she was waiting for someone.

Disappointed but happy for the interaction alone, the crowd of girls 
dispersed, trailing off in groups of two and three.

Looking back through her blonde locks, Hikari stared at the dormitory 
entrance, hoping to see Yaya-chan&#39;s smiling face. When it didn&#39;t appear, 
she glanced at the ground, sighing, before turning in dismay to begin 
the journey alone.

- - - - -

The heavy double doors to the school council chamber swung open, and the 
imposing figure of council President Rokujo strode into the room. 
Pushing the doors to behind her, she turned to the room&#39;s occupants.

The girls sat around the wide oak table as was traditional, 
representatives from each of the three Astrea schools sat together on 
either side. From Spica, Shion, Kaname and Momomi had attended as usual. 
From Lulim, Chikaru and her assistants, and from Miator Miyuki noted her 
colleagues Hitomi and Mizuho. Her lip curled at the presence of those 
two, though she made sure no one noticed. Sat at the head of the table 
was Amane, her blue riding tunic and folded yellow neck tie giving her 
an almost regal appearance, her soft brown eyes regarding the Miatorian 
president.

&quot;Good morning Rokujo-san,&quot; Chikaru chimed, smiling pleasantly at her 
peer. &quot;We didn&#39;t know whether to expect you; Sister Mizue said you&#39;d 
been taken ill.&quot;

Miyuki nodded politely, bemused by Shizuma covering for her. &quot;Just a 
stomach compliant, nothing serious enough to interfere with my duties.&quot; 
She turned to take her place at the table, walking the length of the 
room with a purposeful stride.

&quot;In your absence, Tougi-san and Kanou-san have done an excellent job 
taking care of matters on your behalf,&quot; Chikaru offered.

Miyuki didn&#39;t doubt it, and muttered her thanks as she arrived at her 
chair, pulling it back from the table. She noted Chikaru&#39;s gaze take in 
the soft linen bandage covering the fingers of her right hand as it 
rested on the tall back of the chair in front of her, adding,

&quot;I broke a glass and rushed to clean it up. Foolish of me.&quot;

Settling herself, she watched her companions&#39; faces for signs of a 
telling expression. When one failed to surface, she relaxed in her 
chair, pouring herself a glass of orange juice. She turned to Amane,

&quot;Is Hikari not attending?&quot;

The dark haired Spican shook her head, replying softly,

&quot;She has classes this morning. She won&#39;t be able to get away until 
lunch.&quot;

With everything in place, Chikaru eagerly pronounced,

&quot;Which makes a full house then. Shall we begin?&quot;

Chikaru stood, holding a collection of notes before her, addressing her 
fellow council members,

&quot;I hereby call this meeting to order, and welcome representatives from 
Miator, Spica and Lulim to the table. I&#39;d also like to take this 
opportunity to welcome our new Etoile to her first meeting.&quot;

She smiled pleasantly at Amane before continuing,

&quot;First item on the agenda is the forthcoming Christmas Ball. As is 
traditional each fall before the dormitory girls return home, we are 
required to...&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s attention switched, Chikaru&#39;s voice fading into the background 
as she thought she caught an odd look from the Spican Etoile in the 
corner of her eye. Scrutinizing Amane&#39;s face, she waited to see if it 
returned, but the tall fifth year&#39;s eyes were locked on Chikaru as she 
gave her speech. Miyuki pondered inwardly, wondering what Shizuma had 
told her newly appropriated friend, before returning her attention to 
the checked uniform of the Lulim president.

If she stayed the course she intended, Miyuki thought to herself, things 
were certainly going to get interesting.

- - - - -

Hikari sat alone at recess, sheltered in an alcove next to the water 
fountain, away from the other girls as they chattered over soda and 
snacks in the courtyard.

Class had not gone well, and regardless which subject she had attended, 
the Sensei had all made a point of singling her out, asking her to talk 
on various aspects of the lesson, or give an opinion for the other girls 
to consider. Hikari was certain some of her classmates must be getting 
sick of it.

All the while, Yaya had remained distracted, her usual class companion 
either day dreaming or responding to conversation half heartedly. Hikari 
hung her head in dismay, disappointed that being with Amane seemed to 
have cost her such a dear friend.

She wished she&#39;d dealt with Yaya&#39;s feelings more sensitively, but the 
past weeks had been so over whelming they&#39;d been side tracked on the 
way.

Lost in her thoughts, she jumped when Kaname&#39;s dulcet tones startled 
her,

&quot;Surprising to see you sat alone. I would have expected to find you 
swamped in admirers.&quot;

Hikari turned to find the tall fifth year perched next to her, leaning 
over the ornate stone fountain in curiosity.

Hikari looked back down at her feet, which she shuffled uncomfortably 
under the alcove bench.

&quot;I just wanted to be on my own, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Noting Hikari&#39;s defensive posture, Kaname sighed and replied,

&quot;You don&#39;t need to be wary of me anymore Hikari, I would hoped you&#39;d 
have realised that.&quot; She ruffled the third year&#39;s blonde locks and 
chuckled,

&quot;You were never my type anyway.&quot;

Wondering if that was meant to be a form of consolation, Hikari glanced 
up into Kaname&#39;s dark eyes.

&quot;Do you know if Amane-senpai is finished with the school council yet?&quot;

Smiling wryly, Kaname responded,

&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid not. They&#39;re still thrashing out the Christmas Ball. 
Shion and Miyuki are squabbling over the venue as per usual.&quot;

Hikari looked disappointed. She sat silent for a moment, her blue eyes 
welling as she blinked back gathering tears. All of a sudden, she felt 
intensely lonely, longing for a friendly face; someone to sweep her up 
in their arms and tell her everything was going to be okay.

Kaname was genuinely surprised to see the young girl so distressed, and 
for a few awkward seconds she stood there watching tears roll across 
Hikari&#39;s face, unsure what to do. Eventually, she reached forward,

&quot;Hikari, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

The tiny third year shrank back from Kaname&#39;s touch. Just as she did, a 
particularly loud voice broke above the others in the sea of chatter 
from the courtyard,

&quot;It&#39;s not like she deserves Etoile anyway; any tramp could have stood 
alongside Amane-sama and looked good.&quot;

Hikari&#39;s eyes widened in pain and she covered her face in the darkness 
of the alcove, gentle sobs taking her.

Kaname snarled protectively, looking out into the courtyard. Noting the 
particularly obnoxious looking individual, Kaname turned back to Hikari, 
moving to rest a hand on the young girl&#39;s shoulder. She stopped midway, 
thinking better of it, before adding,

&quot;Stay here.&quot;

White uniform bright in the high sun, the fifth year strode out across 
the courtyard, straight toward the loud mouthed fourth year who stood 
chatting to her friends. Curious eyes followed her path and the circle 
of bodies parted as Kaname forced her way face to face with the chubby 
brunette. A mess of greasy curls, braces and acne, she was never going 
to win any Etoile elections herself, her taut Spica uniform barely 
coping with the rolls of fat. Athletic, sultry and wearing an imposing 
scowl, Kaname towered over her. The other girls around the face-off fell 
silent, turning to watch the show.

The younger girl swallowed uncomfortably, looking up in trepidation.

&quot;Council member Kenjo-san.&quot;

&quot;Do you have a problem with either of our new Etoile?&quot; Kaname demanded, 
her tone dry and inflammatory.

The younger girl stammered back, &quot;I.. I was just saying - &quot;

&quot;Well don&#39;t.&quot; Kaname snapped.

She waited for a cocky reply, but her presence alone seemed to have done 
the trick, so when none came she gave the blob a final look through 
slanted eyelids and turned on heel, heading back to where she&#39;d left 
Hikari.

To her dismay, the blonde third year had gone and Kaname turned to see 
Hikari&#39;s blonde locks bobbing as she ran off towards Miator.

&quot;You have the attention span of a gold fish.&quot;

Noting the venom in the statement, Kaname turned to face Momomi&#39;s 
familiar voice.

She looked her roommate in the eyes, waiting patiently for the rest of 
the inevitable tirade.

&quot;You threw our chance at Etoile out of the window sulking after Amane, 
and now I find you doting over her plaything. What is it with you?&quot;

Kaname sighed, caught off guard and lacking the motivation for come 
back.

&quot;She looked lonely, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Momomi&#39;s face was a stark picture of puzzlement.

&quot;Since when did you care, you practically raped the girl only a month 
ago.&quot; Momomi&#39;s whispered snarl nowhere near quite enough for Kaname&#39;s 
liking.

&quot;Momomi - &quot;

Long brown hair whisked past Kaname&#39;s face as the agitated brunette 
flounced, turning and striding off in a huff.

Kaname sighed and let her go, knowing full well there would be more to 
come later when she returned to her room. It didn&#39;t matter, Momomi would 
still finish the night in her bed as she always did.

Expression changing, her attention returned to Hikari, and she looked 
with unfamiliar concern in the direction the young Etoile had run off.

- - - - -

Leaning over the table, Shion&#39;s shoulders slumped in tiredness as the 
double doors of the council chamber banged close behind Miyuki, finally 
signalling an end to the meeting. The blonde haired President of Spica 
watched as they came to rest, and then flopped in her chair exhausted, 
her head resting in her hands for a moment. Letting her nerves calm, she 
listened to the shuffling of the others around her, before lifting her 
eyes to the Lulim President opposite.

&quot;Any idea what that was about then?&quot; she asked, watching as Chikaru 
carefully packed her notebook and belongings into her satchel. Chikaru 
frowned, looking at the clock before answering. The forty minute 
discussion had snowballed into a three hour row, with neither Shion nor 
Miyuki happy to give ground.

&quot;She certainly fought her corner this morning didn&#39;t she,&quot; Chikaru 
commented. She closed her satchel and looked to Hitomi and Mizuho as 
they made their way round the table to the door, looking to follow the 
other Miatorian representative.

&quot;No idea Minamoto-sama,&quot; the red headed Hitomi replied. &quot;I&#39;ve not seen 
her that agitated during a meeting for a long while.&quot;

The pair nodded their farewell and left to head to their classes. 
Chikaru&#39;s assistants had already departed long ago with Spica&#39;s second 
and third representatives, the unusually drawn out meeting conflicting 
with other commitments and lessons. Only Shion, Amane and Chikaru 
remained in the room, the Spican Etoile sat at the head of the table, 
gazing out of the window in quiet thought.

&quot;You usually have your nose into everything going on here Chikaru, are 
you really telling me even you don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into her?&quot;

Chikaru shrugged, then admitted with a smile,

&quot;No, but I&#39;d love to find out.&quot;

Amane sat silently as Shion turned to her, scratching the back of her 
head.

&quot;Etoile-sama?&quot;

Amane turned, regarding the other two with deep brown eyes.

&quot;You seem to be talking to Shizuma a lot recently; has she mentioned 
anything about Miyuki?&quot;

Amane frowned, considering to what degree she should break the 
former-Etoile&#39;s confidence. After a moment, she opted to a blanket no, 
deciding that the things spoken about in the green house weren&#39;t council 
member business.

&quot;No she hasn&#39;t. However, I&#39;ve not spoken with Shizuma this morning, so 
if she was going to mention Miyuki she hasn&#39;t had the chance yet.&quot; She 
turned her gaze back to the window and added, &quot;That said, Rokujo-san was 
adamant that the Christmas Ball be held at Miator wasn&#39;t she.&quot;

Shion nodded,

&quot;Despite the lack of facilities. After all, it&#39;s Spica with the new 
sports - &quot;

Amane cut in before Shion had the opportunity to get going again,

&quot;Yes, I noted your concerns earlier Tomori-san.&quot;

Shion pouted and got up to leave.

&quot;Well we&#39;re not going to get anywhere in a hurry if she continues like 
this. Perhaps Etoile-san might apply some more forceful persausion next 
meeting.&quot;

With that she left, disappearing down the hall in a mood.

Amane sighed and smiled at Chikaru,

&quot;Is it always like this?&quot;

Chikaru grinned back,

&quot;I would say yes, but this morning was acceptional I have to admit.&quot; Her 
eyes winked with intrigue,

&quot;And there I was thinking everything would go back to normal after the 
election.&quot;

Having made sure she&#39;d collected all of her belongings, Chikaru also bid 
Amane farewall and took her leave.

Sitting back in her chair, Amane sighed, enjoying the solitude. This was 
certainly becoming hard work; Shizuma hadn&#39;t understated anything when 
Amane had first asked her about the position as Etoile, that was for 
sure. Looking up at the clock, she abandoned the thought, noting that if 
she didn&#39;t hurry up, she&#39;d be late for class herself.

- - - - -

It was cold out by the lake, and Shizuma pulled her long cashmere coat 
tighter around her as she walked. The sun was losing a running battle 
with thick grey clouds, and she knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before the snow 
would return. Why she was out here at all was fast becoming a good 
question.

Looking out at the frigid water, the moody sky reflecting in its 
surface, she pondered the morning&#39;s events with Miyuki.

It wasn&#39;t as though her room mate hadn&#39;t lost her temper before; on 
several occasions in the past Miyuki had thrown books and clothes at 
her, even going as far as slapping her across the face once. But this 
morning had been different, the anger in Miyuki&#39;s eyes still burned in 
Shizuma&#39;s mind.

Anger, or pain; which of the two words being more appropriate Shizuma 
was unsure.

Had she really mistreated the sixth former by that degree? Shizuma 
looked back over their many years of friendship, considering the 
countless times she&#39;d teased or flirted with the dark haired council 
President. She&#39;d tickled her, groped her, even gone as far as the 
forceful kiss that had landed her the slap. But even then, Miyuki had 
seemed to take it either in jest, or at least in understanding. Had 
Shizuma really misjudged Miyuki that much?

Were her feelings really that strong?

She thought back to the day she&#39;d been introduced to Kaori; Miyuki&#39;s 
words as she described the tiny raven-haired beauty.

&#39;Just my type&#39; she thought to herself. Surely then Miyuki should know 
that she herself, could never be.

Shizuma sighed, and stopped to look at the gentle waves as they reached 
the shore, the growing wind stirring ripples far out across the water.

&#39;Isn&#39;t it time this got easy again?&#39; she asked herself.

The wind nagged at her hem, and she slid her hands deep into the silk 
lined pockets of her coat for warmth. Confused, she rolled a cold, hard 
item around at the bottom of her right-hand pocket. Feeling a chain 
attached, her face flashed with recognition as she drew forth the gold 
key to her vacation home.

Handy, she&#39;d be needing that the night after next.

Pondering, she turned the key over and over in her hand as Miyuki&#39;s 
words came back to her, the delicate chain swinging in the wind.

&#39;..it&#39;d have been me at the summer house that first night you went 
back...&#39;

Shizuma sighed, realizing that yes, perhaps it should have been. After 
all, it was Miyuki that had shared the months of anguish at her side 
after Kaori&#39;s death, Miyuki that had stood outside Kaori&#39;s room, waiting 
at the door as Shizuma cried herself to sleep in private, knowing that 
she couldn&#39;t enter but waiting all the same in case the former-Etoile 
had called her.

True friendship some would call it. Pity perhaps from a more cynical 
angle. But understandably, also perhaps the actions of a prospective 
lover.

Shizuma bowed her head. Someone else she&#39;d chewed up on her way through 
it seems.

Turning the key again, her mind wandered to Nagisa. Looking over her 
shoulder in the direction of Kaori&#39;s tree, she smiled fondly. Colour 
she&#39;d told Nagisa; it was Nagisa who&#39;d put the colour back into her 
world. Without doubt, the cheery, easily embarrassed fourth year had 
been the jolt she&#39;d needed, the spark to restart her world.

Surely Miyuki could see that, understand the difference. There was 
nothing Miyuki could offer her to replicate the same feelings in 
Shizuma&#39;s previously locked heart. She was too connected, too integral 
to the experience with Kaori to play the role of her savour.

Like it or not, Miyuki would have to settle with a bit part; the friend 
that held her hand in the darkness between dusk and dawn; not the sun 
itself as it rose again the following day.

Resolute, she turned from the tree; the visit to her usual place of 
thought unnecessary. Nagisa was everything she&#39;d needed, everything she 
could want for, and regardless of Miyuki&#39;s new behaviour, Shizuma wasn&#39;t 
going to let those feelings slip away. She&#39;d lost out once through no 
fault of her own; she wasn&#39;t going to cause herself the same pain by 
choice, nor by anyone else&#39;s.

- - - - -

Yaya looked at the empty chair behind the table in front of her as she 
packed her things away at the end of class. She nagged herself for not 
having noticed earlier on in the lesson; perhaps she could&#39;ve excused 
herself to go looking for the missing Hikari then. Their English teacher 
more understanding that most.

She over heard whispered comments as the other girls shuffled past 
towards the open classroom door, noting the Etoile&#39;s absence and 
conjuring wild reasoning for it. Some of which was less than pleasant.

Yaya sighed at the negativity. More than once today she&#39;d over heard bad 
comments about her room mate, and while being less than eager to 
confront the speaker as she&#39;d heard Kaname had so aggressively earlier, 
she wished she knew the reason for the backlash. Jealousy perhaps? Amane 
was easily one of the most popular Etoiles of recent years, behind of 
course the beautiful yet tragic Shizuma. Perhaps the relative youth of 
the second Etoile this time round had led to some feeling she&#39;d been 
unworthy of the position.

Whatever the reason, despite Yaya&#39;s recent state of distraction, it was 
beginning to get on her tits.

And what in god&#39;s name was the altercation with Kaname about?

Yaya laughed to herself. The local bully gone good?

She shouldered her satchel after closing it, and headed for the door.

To her surprise, the smiling face of Amane greeted her as she stepped 
out into the corridor.

&quot;Etoile-sama,&quot; Yaya nodded politely in greeting.

&quot;Hello Yaya-san. Is Hikari not with you?&quot; Amane asked in surprise.

Yaya looked at the floor, unsettled and feeling somewhat guilty at 
having ignored the absence for so long herself.

&quot;I&#39;ve um, not seen her since this morning Etoile-sama. My apologies.&quot;

Amane smiled fondly, replying,

&quot;You&#39;ve no need to apologise Yaya-san.&quot; Then with puzzlement, she added, 
&quot;Have you?&quot;

Yaya shuffled again, then looked at the floor, Amane&#39;s gaze 
uncomfortable.

&quot;I um, may have been a little distracted of late. I hope Hikari&#39;s not 
taken that the wrong way, but I&#39;ve not had the chance to talk to her 
about it.&quot;

Amane looked up from the tiny Spican and glanced along the corridor in 
either direction.

&quot;You&#39;ve no idea where she could&#39;ve gone?&quot; Amane asked, returning her 
gaze to the third year.

Yaya looked up and replied,

&quot;There is one place.&quot;

- - - - -

Hikari sat alone, fingers running through the icy water of the pool in 
front of the statue of the Virgin Mary. Tear stains covered her cheeks, 
and she sniffed occasionally in the cold air. The cutting winds were 
growing fast, and she knew it would soon be time to go back to the 
Dormitory for dinner.

She&#39;d cut the remaining classes of the day, unable to face the continued 
remarks and the stress that came with them. Struggling to find Amane, 
she&#39;d given up traipsing the school grounds and returned to her usual 
place of solace.

She looked at her reflection in the pool, framed by the thunderous 
heavens.

Was this the face of someone deserving the title Etoile? Was she really 
worthy of standing beside Amane, when so many others had dreamed of the 
same opportunity?

Hikari sighed.

Was she worthy of anything anymore? Even her best friend had abandoned 
her after mistreatment.

She blanched again at Yaya&#39;s continued distraction. Not sure the cause, 
but thinking she could probably guess, she wondered if things would have 
turned out differently had she responded to Yaya&#39;s kiss more calmly.

A tear rolled free from her eye, splashing in the pool and disturbing 
the image staring back up.

In her tiny world, right there, Hikari felt so intensely alone.

&quot;Hikari-chan?&quot;

A voice called through the trees, followed by another, deeper voice,

&quot;Hikari?&quot;

The blonde Etoile looked back towards the Dormitories, wiping her eyes 
quickly. She couldn&#39;t let anyone see her like this. The last thing Amane 
needed was for Hikari to prove the critics right, to be found snivelling 
in self-doubt.

She pulled a handkerchief from her pocket, wiped her eyes again and 
straightened her hair. Taking a deep breath, she finished just in time 
as Amane and Yaya rounded the corner to the statue&#39;s garden.

&quot;Hikari?&quot; Amane hurried over to her, kneeling before her fellow Etoile.

&quot;Hikari are you alright?&quot;

Yaya stood a few paces behind, looking nervous and concerned.

Hikari smiled, her big blue eyes gazing into Amane&#39;s face.

&quot;Amane-senpai.&quot; She nodded, &quot;I just felt a little ill. I thought I&#39;d 
come for some fresh air.&quot;

Amane looked at her, an expression of doubt replacing the concern, 
although the notion wasn&#39;t vocalised by the older Etoile.

&quot;It&#39;s getting cold Hikari, and we have dinner soon. We should get back 
to the Dorms.&quot;

Hikari nodded, shivering slightly in the cold.

Amane unbuttoned her riding coat, wrapping it around the younger girl&#39;s 
shoulders.

&quot;There. Let&#39;s go before it starts snowing.&quot;

Hikari nodded again, before getting up and brushing her white Spican 
skirt down. She looked across at Yaya, who returned the gaze.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Hikari, I should have come looking for you sooner.&quot;

Hikari shrugged,

&quot;Yaya-chan isn&#39;t Hikari&#39;s keeper. It&#39;s okay.&quot; Hikari continued, faking 
the sentiment. &quot;I should have said something before leaving afternoon 
class, I knew Yaya-chan would be worried.&quot;

Yaya looked relieved, and smiled.

&quot;As long as you&#39;re okay?&quot;

Hikari&#39;s eyes turned to Amane, who held an arm round the young Etoile&#39;s 
shoulders, trying to keep her warm.

&quot;I am now.&quot; Hikari added.

- - - - -

The head table had been quiet at the evening meal, with the two Etoile 
both lost in thought, and Shizuma, Nagisa and Tamao quietly discussing 
earlier events with Miyuki. Amane had briefly recounted the school 
council meeting to the others, but had then fallen silent, pondering her 
fellow Spican&#39;s sullen nature. Concern grew in her mind as the meal had 
progressed, and she glanced occasionally at her girlfriend who sat next 
to her, eyes down, toying with the remaining food on her plate.

The five girls had also fallen extremely quiet as the brooding Miyuki 
stalked past, sitting off to one side with some of the other senior 
Miatorians.

The atmosphere in the hall leaving an unpleasant taste in everyone&#39;s 
mouth, they opted to leave earlier than usual, heading back to their 
Dormitories together.

&quot;Remember to pack some clothes for town as well,&quot; Shizuma added, 
discussing the weekend&#39;s plans. &quot;I have every intention of picking 
something up for the Christmas Ball while we&#39;re out.&quot;

Amane looked away. She&#39;d never been the best at choosing clothes, and 
hated shopping for them with a passion.

Shizuma noted the look and chuckled,

&quot;Yes Amane; I know full well you&#39;d wear your jockey shorts and riding 
jacket all day given the option.&quot;

Amane smiled, replying,

&quot;I&#39;m not gifted with Shizuma-sama&#39;s grace I&#39;m afraid. Dresses and gowns 
make me feel like a scarecrow.&quot;

Shizuma laughed, though Hikari looked distraught,

&quot;Amane-senpai is not a scarecrow!&quot;

Amane smiled, squeezing the young Etoile&#39;s hand.

&quot;Thank you Hikari.&quot;

Tamao tried to stay out of the way on the journey back, feeling like the 
tag nut amongst a group of friends that had history going back years. 
Pondering her own gown for the Christmas Ball, she gazed at the floor 
while she walked.

&quot;Is Tamao-chan going to come to town with us?&quot; Nagisa asked, ribbing her 
room mate to wake her up.

Tamao baulked.

&quot;I&#39;ve not got permission to stay out,&quot; she said, not realizing she was 
invited.

&quot;I know, but there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t accompany us to town is 
there?&quot; Nagisa asked, looking disappointed that the dark haired fourth 
year was suggesting she wouldn&#39;t come.

&quot;You can&#39;t stay home alone all day,&quot; Shizuma added. &quot;Besides, Nagisa&#39;s 
taste in clothes is awful, she&#39;ll need all the help she can get.&quot;

Nagisa looked at her lover with a face of surprised rejection, but 
Shizuma only smiled back, her green eyes twinkling with the tease.

Tamao smiled.

&quot;She is a bit hopeless isn&#39;t she,&quot; Tamao remarked, then brightening up 
she added, &quot;Perhaps I should come along just so I can laugh at 
Nagisa-chan&#39;s choices.&quot;

Shizuma grinned, and Nagisa ribbed her as well for good measure.

&quot;Bah, you can both sleep outside if this continues.&quot;

The girls laughed as they turned the corner.

Stopping dead, the five found themselves facing Miyuki, a scowl covering 
her face as she regarded the friends.

For an awkward moment, the group looked at the school council President 
without speaking, Miyuki staring back firmly.

Then with a swish of black uniform and hair, Miyuki strode past, 
disappearing down the hall.

The jovial atmosphere broken, the group continued in silence, splitting 
by school when they reached their appropriate corridors.

Certain Tamao was asleep; Shizuma gently rocked the auburn beauty lying 
next to her. With a sigh, Nagisa&#39;s soft brown eyes opened, and she 
turned under the cosy cotton covers to look at the former-Etoile.

&quot;Shizuma-sama?&quot; Nagisa lifted a hand to Shizuma&#39;s face, brushing back 
the long silver hair from her eyes.

Shizuma shuffled slightly, sitting up in their bed. Reaching back behind 
her, she lifted her long black overcoat quietly from the desk, putting 
it in her lap in front of her. Whispering, she explained,

&quot;There&#39;s something I&#39;ve been meaning to give to you Nagisa, but with 
this morning&#39;s events I&#39;ve not had the chance yet.&quot;

Nagisa sat up, facing Shizuma as she reached into the coat pocket. 
Shizuma closed her hand over the object she sought, and then stopped for 
a minute, looking at Nagisa until she knew she had the younger girl&#39;s 
unreserved attention.

&quot;When I first gave this to you, as strong as my feelings were for you at 
the time, I know now my prime concern was for myself, not for you.&quot;

Nagisa looked confused, but Shizuma put a finger to her lips before 
continuing,

&quot;When I took it back again, I promised myself I&#39;d never hurt another 
person by pulling them into my sorrow. That I was going to deal with it 
all on my own, without dragging anyone else down.&quot;

She looked at the bed cover a moment, constructing the words in her 
head.

&quot;Even now, the extent of the mess I&#39;ve made whilst trying to do that is 
still dawning on me.&quot;

Miyuki crept into Shizuma&#39;s mind for a moment, and briefly her resolve 
broke. &#39;Dear Miyuki... what have I done to you?&#39; she asked herself.

But gritting her teeth, she pushed the thought from her mind, determined 
it was a going to stay a separate issue.

&quot;That said, I know now that although I may have been wrong to give it to 
you originally; to put you through helping me with that burden without 
telling you what lay ahead or explaining to you why, you and you alone 
should be the one to keep it now that burden is gone.&quot;

She pulled her hand from the coat, slowly opening her slender fingers. 
Nestled in her palm, glittering gold in the low light of the dormitory 
lay the key to her vacation home.

Nagisa looked at it, swamped in emotions. The pain of the night in the 
green house came back to her, and tears gathered in the corner of her 
eyes.

&quot;Shizuma - &quot;

The sixth year cut in,

&quot;You were the only person that could reach me Nagisa. The only person 
able to unlock my heart. To open it again after being closed from the 
world for so long.&quot;

Leaving the key on the bed, she reached forward and un-buttoned Nagisa&#39;s 
night shirt. Brushing soft red hair behind Nagisa&#39;s ears, she took the 
chain in both hands, uncoupling the catch before holding it between them 
for a moment.

&quot;This belongs to you Nagisa, just like the heart you rescued, and I 
promise never to take it from you again.&quot;

Tears rolled free, sliding down Nagisa&#39;s cheeks as she bowed her head 
slightly, allowing Shizuma to reach over her shoulders, closing the 
catch firmly before resting the chain around Nagisa&#39;s neck. The key spun 
idly in the valley of Nagisa&#39;s breast, and the fourth year touched it 
softly with her fingers.

Looking up into Shizuma&#39;s emerald eyes, she whispered,

&quot;I love you Shizuma Hanazono.&quot;

Shizuma, gazing back, ran her thumb across Nagisa&#39;s cheek, wiping away 
the tears.

&quot;I love you too Nagisa.&quot;

In the dim light of the dormitory, the two girls embraced, holding each 
other dearly for long moments before sliding under the covers and 
curling up together.

Lying as silently as possible on the other side of the room, her 
breathing halted and her eyes staring blankly at the wall next to her, 
Tamao quietly cried herself to sleep; only the pillow beneath her 
witness to the salty shower of tears that rained onto it.
