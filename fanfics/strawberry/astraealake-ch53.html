<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Some say  Amane's horse is Star Bride. Wiki says Star Bright but I've taken to  rendering that Starbright, because the pronunciation feels better. My  proposition, with apologies to Flower-san, is that we call him Star  Birdie from now on. Sophisticated irony, ne?</span></p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Crushing.  Liking. Loving. A sliding scale of similar but individual emotions,  difficult to pinpoint and define. If you were taking it very seriously,  you’d have to include other phrases as well, such as hero worship and  puppy love. God, that phrase has always irritated me. Aren’t puppies  allowed to fall in love now? But whatever. The fact remains, it’s hard  to work out whether any of the three applies to you, and if so which.  Even if everyone around sounds so certain that they understand, it  isn’t easy for you to be so sure. Probably because you, and you alone,  know the complexity of those feelings. Even when it’s a certain thing,  I doubt love is all that simple. My suspicion is that it waxes and  wanes like a tide, it can certainly fade and it might even be able to  grow again. But emotions are like colours, almost. It’s impossible to  verify exactly what other people experience which they call emotions,  so you can’t exactly you feel or what you should call it. If it’s anger  or sadness, everyone quickly builds up enough experience to describe  them quickly and accurately. Crushing, liking, loving… romantic  feelings are something else entirely, because we are slow to gain  experience of them. But they’re important, supposedly one of the most  powerful emotions. No, more than that, in literature and film, in the  psychology of society, romantic love is considered the foremost,  strongest emotion. This strange thing “love” can forgive courses of  action that would otherwise be inexplicable or even inexcusable.  However, those characters are always confident and assured, absolutely  certain of their feelings. Individuals like the Etoiles are probably  the same. They’ve leaned their place on that sliding scale together.  But for me and my feelings, I can’t know. I’m only a child, after all.</span></em>Kaname  leaned back on her bed, savouring every detail of the long lunch with  Momomi. Her features and gestures, mannerisms and words, the way her  voice moved along with her hands, the way she ate, all those things  were burned into her mind. She remembered the sight of those small,  pretty lips and touched her own. She blushed and shifted uncomfortably,  snatching her hand away. The bandage felt tight round her knuckles,  soaking with sweat and a little blood. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But love can be a platonic  as well as a romantic concept. Love, in itself, is horribly ill  defined. The Greeks had it better organised, with Eros and…what was  it…Deimos? No, that’s a moon. I forget. You are supposed to love family  and you can also love friends, but neither of those emotions are  supposed to be the same as romantic. The first is apparently sick and  the second is merely dangerous to friendship, if your feelings are  romantic ones. But it’s also impossible for me to know why I lie on  that scale, too. It’s a complex picture. Where is the line drawn?  Ultimately, romance is a prelude to…well…sex. I may be young, but I’m  not that young. Perhaps not in every relationship, but a romantic  relationship is in itself something like an understanding that  eventually-maybe-under-the-right-circumstances sex might occur. And in  the meantime, perhaps, the stuff that comes before it. I think, anyway.  But can you want to kiss someone without entertaining any thoughts  about…other stuff? Is that romance or a kind of extended friendship?  Should you start a romantic relationship if that’s all you can  contemplate? Platonic romance…is there such a thing? It sounds like  such a contradiction in terms. Well, I’m thirteen. What the hell do I  know? I guess I’m taking myself too seriously again. Just play things  by the ear and see what happens, right?</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yeah, right. Momomi’s too important for my usual flighty charge. </em>Kaname’s fingers traced little circles on her duvet. <em>But  still, that sliding scale is very difficult for someone like me. Some  things are hard to deny. I love Momomi’s company, and for preference  I’d be with her more often than not, as much as physically possible. I  also like having some sense of physical intimacy, the touching,  hugging, even holding hands; those are all things I enjoy, because they  make me feel closer to her. I still find it weird to be loved but I’m  beginning to understand some sense of attraction. I can look at her and  be interested with even little details, watching her is a pastime and  an end unto itself. She is beautiful, and that’s clear for me to see.  I’m beginning to wonder what it’d be like to kiss her, and I no longer  automatically assume it would be a traumatic experience. No, more than  that, I’m beginning to…well…fantasise about it. Just a little, before I  stop myself. If that romantic love? Or am I just wilfully deluding  myself, because I’ve grown so used to those stories and that way of  thinking at this school? Everyone is basically pressurising me into  this, ostensibly to make me realise my true feelings. They may be  right; they may be doing just that. Or they may be pushing me to think  I’m going through something that has no depth or reality to it. I can’t  tell. Feelings are so transient and I have no experience with these  feelings to know. I feel like I need…something. Something solid and  absolute and there. And when I think of that, the only thing I think of  Momomi, and how warm she feels in my arms.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Someone knocked at the door. Kaname went through some mental calculations, based on what she knew of her friends. <em>Shion, Serané or a Sister. Everyone else would simply walk in. </em>She rolled over, facing the wall, and hoped that they went away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou-kun? Can I come in?” Another knock. It was Serané’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname closed her eyes and tried to still her breathing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you’ll excuse me.” Serané opened the door and stepped in, closing it  behind her. “You know, it’s not polite to stay silent under these  circumstances, Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone has been skipping lessons all day. I have a duty to investigate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you the one skipping lessons here, and as my senior?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  would have a private study period right now, actually. But some things  are best dealt with at this time, not at other times. For instance,  what Kariya’s dealing with right now.” Serané shook her head. “Some  Lulim first years were bullying their compatriots in Miator. You’re a  little lucky. I have a gentler touch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unlike them,” Kaname replied, sounding bored. “Wait… hang on a second. <em>Lulim </em>students bullying people? Let’s-make-paper-aeroplanes-and-watch-clouds Lulim?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Teenagers  are teenagers everywhere, Kenjou-kun. The good and the bad.” Serané  walked over and sat at the head of the bed, where Kaname had no choice  but to look at her. “But I won’t let you change the subject. Why are  you skipping out on lessons?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it to you?” Kaname glared at the wall. “I wanted to skip for the hell of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I doubt that. You haven’t done that since you and Kiyashiki-san became friends.” Serané smiled. “Lovesick?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t screw with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  prodded her on the forehead. “That’s don’t screw with me, Etoile-sama  to you, thank you very much. But I still think it’s probably something  like that. Ohtori-san and her… it’s an interesting situation, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She said she’s not interested,” Kaname muttered. “It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you have talked about it. Well, I think it’s a pity. They’d make a nice  couple, though I shouldn’t say such things.” Serané shrugged. “More  importantly, Kiyashiki-san may be able to do for Ohtori-san what she  did for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t speak as if I’m the disease and Momomi’s the cure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané laughed. “Heaven forbid. But the two of you have improved each other’s behaviour, somewhat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that got to with anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  made no reply, and to her surprise, Serané didn’t move at all, or say  anything either. They stayed like that for a few moments. Kaname stole  a nervous glance upwards, only to find Serané sitting gracefully with  her hands folded on her lap, blue eyes looking round the room with  apparent interest. She looked away. <em>Okay, so that’s how it is, is  it? Well, screw her. I don’t know what she’s trying to achieve, but I’m  not going to fall for it. I don’t have anything to say to her. She can  sit here and stare at the wall all day for all I care. I don’t have  anything to say to her, and I’m not going to go to lessons unless she  forces me to do so, so forget it. I’ll just lie here like I was going  to do anyway, and say nothing at all, and just think about what I was  going to do anyway. Or… well… oh, screw it. There are times for dignity  but this isn’t one of them. I just need answers. And this is someone  who understands the sliding scale, according to my theory.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say,  Serané… if I ask you a question, would you promise not to tell it to  anyone, on the pain of torture, dismemberment and death?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That depends on the question, but… that would probably be fine. Certainly, for a personal matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not even Kariya. Especially not Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right… well… that’s to say…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?” Serané asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  closed her eyes. Perhaps this would be easier if she pretended she was  talking to herself. “If you… like someone, how can you tell?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I presume this isn’t the innocent friendship meaning of the term?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think so, no.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you know how to ask a difficult question. I wish I had a definite  answer to give you.” Serané was silent for a moment. “Well, I’ll start  with myself. To me, a liking that became love… that was a long time  ago, but I remember it quite well. It was a shift in awareness to me,  from friend to something more, and I was never certain about it until  well after that fact. Physical attraction, curiosity, emotional  attachment and a mental possessive sense, <em>my </em>Kariya, increasing  jealousy, enjoyment of her conversation and her silence, a general  fascination with her… I’m blabbering. But all those things are  involved. I became aware of other possibilities and started to think  about them. That’s important, I think. Someone who isn’t interested  won’t even notice other possibilities, in my experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, this has been brought rather forcibly to my attention.” <em>All the same, I don’t do badly under those criteria…wait, this isn’t an exam, damnit! High marks doesn’t make me happy!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  the same, you plainly aren’t pushing it to the back of your mind and  forgetting about it.” Serané shrugged. “Well, since then, and  especially since I became Etoile with Kariya and made everyone else’s  business my own, I’ve seen a lot of couples in all states of emotion.  People get together and break up for good and bad reasons, love and  lust and crushes and admiration and even boredom, and the concept of  liking can’t easily be defined.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, thanks for the answer.” Kaname kept her eyes closed and tried to disassociate the voice from Serané specifically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  now. I didn’t say I was finished. It’s difficult to tell. But, one  thing I’ve noticed and learned from everything… feelings you keep  locked in your heart are worthless. When you have the courage and  strength to know you want to say <em>yes, I feel something for you, I want to get to know you as more than just a friend</em>… perhaps that, in itself, is what it means to truly like someone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Feels a little backwards,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  liking someone and desiring to confess should be the same thing, to my  mind. There are very few circumstances when I consider suppressing  one’s feelings a good course of action.” Serané sighed. “But of course,  you’re right. I haven’t really answered your question. I think it’s a  realisation you have to find on your own terms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “You suck at giving guidance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there is one very useful way to clarify things,” Serané began, her tone lighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. What’s that, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kissing someone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what?” Kaname demanded, startled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  when I kissed Kariya after our first date… that was very memorable. I  knew, then, that I really did like her.” Serané giggled. “Even if we  did miss on the first try and banged jaws the second time. That was  awkward, of course, these things tend to be. But for all that, I still  didn’t fault that first kiss… it was a rush, of course, but somehow,  between all the hormones, I knew it as well. It was clumsy and awkward  but also gentle, somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why does everyone have to pick the  most dramatic and excruciatingly embarrassing solution?” Kaname moaned.  “On top of that, you managed to make it sound like it’s a generally  horrible experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It isn’t at all. Just don’t expect to get  things exactly right the first time.” Serané giggled again. “But that’s  a positive, you know. It gives a new couple something to learn  together. Quite the bonding exercise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you’re  at an age that takes this very seriously, Kenjou-kun. I understand  that, but not everything has to be perfect. The matter of a kiss is a  good metaphor… you want things to be right the first time. I think they  probably never will be. That’s not because I’m superior to you in any  way. It’s just a matter of perspective.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you getting at?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  date her. Just once. At the end of the day, you kiss, and talk it out  from there. By then, you should know either way. If you do like her,  that’s good. If you don’t, then it’s not a big deal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’d all be fine if she was some girl I don’t know very well, but it  isn’t like that, is it?” Kaname sighed. “I could wreak an important  friendship if I do this wrong…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané smiled at her  affectionately. “It’s not really a matter of right or wrong,  Kenjou-kun. Try and see, that’s all. But I’d say that keeping this kind  of thing locked up inside is even more dangerous for a friendship than  giving things a try. If it really doesn’t work, she’ll know too. She  won’t be too hurt by it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there’s that case when my  hypothetical friend definitely likes me, for whatever reason. If things  are like that, it just feels almost cruel, to go on a date, and then  say no thanks. I’d be getting her hope up and disappointing her, and  that wouldn’t make either of us happy. Plus kissing her is… well…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané chuckled. “Alternately, you might want to tell her to wait a little. You’re young, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright,  alright.” Kaname sighed. “I wouldn’t mind kissing her. I think. If I  can’t say that, you’re right. I might as well give up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t let you force me into anything. Too early is as bad as too late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. Well, I’m just exploring my options, that’s all. Don’t get any funny ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. Perish the thought.” Serané sounded amused, though Kaname had  closed her eyes again to avoid seeing her face. “But for what it’s  worth, that is my advice. Date her, kiss her, talk and clear things up  between the two of you. At the very least, it’ll be a new experience  for you...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname groaned. “So’s being shot… that doesn’t make it a good idea…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One  more thing, Kenjou-kun. I can offer you some more hypothetical advice  about what, in my experience, makes for a good relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to regret this,” Kaname mumbled. “I just know I am. Fine. Fire away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m no social scientist. But what works well, with my relationship and  with others I know…” Serané frowned for a moment, then began to count  off on her fingers. “Friendship, you have to get along well… honesty,  you have to straight with each other, and you also have to be  comfortable with telling them anything, even personal things about  yourself… that’s probably separate, though… mutual physical attraction,  of course… communication, if you have a problem you have to express it  clearly… matching or at least tolerable values, beliefs and preferences  in a relationship… compatible senses of space, you have to want to  spend as much time with her as she does with you… empathy,  understanding and caring… mutual respect, even if it’s a cliché… a  willingness to make sacrifices while clearly indicating where the line  is drawn…” at this point she ran out of fingers, “and sharing things  together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such as?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bothering an entire school’s worth  of teenagers, for example.” Serané laughed. “I bet I just sounded  really sappy. But it can’t be helped, love often is pretty sappy.  That’s how it goes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, you did sound like that,” Kaname  muttered. “Do you have to state so much of this stuff? It’s  embarrassing to draw lines so clearly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said, Kenjou-kun,  communication is important. As long as you’re comfortable talking to  her, though, it should be alright. Though some people prefer to show  their feelings in public or not. That’s something else to worry about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why does everything have to be so complicated and painful sounding?” Kaname moaned. “It’s very off-putting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  speaking with the benefit of hindsight. With Kariya, I didn’t exactly  think things through, and we had our rough moments… but we scraped by  somehow. But if you mean who I think you mean, I think you two should  work out okay.” Serané shrugged. “It’s not like you’re getting married,  or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God. Don’t even mention things like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  be sure to tell her things, Kenjou-kun.” Serané prodded her on the  forehead again. “Us women are very troublesome, you know. We need to  told we’re beautiful and precious about five times a week. We need to  feel appreciated. So, if you think something like that, do say it. Even  if you sound like an idiot it’ll at least be better than giving her the  silent treatment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “Right. I’ll bear that in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  take things too seriously, but move at your own pace, too. You’ll be  fine.” Serané clapped her hands. “But, more importantly, you can’t  skive off lessons forever. I’ll take you back to whatever you’re  supposed to be in now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Yeah, tell me that after the huge counselling session.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before  you’d only brood and angst your way through the day. Now I’ve given you  my sublime advice, you should be able to concentrate, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not exactly. You’ve basically given me even more to worry about. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  well. It can’t be helped.” Serané patted her on the shoulder. “But  you’d better get going. Kiyashiki-san would be very worried if she knew  you were skipping lessons again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright. I don’t have a choice, do I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, you don’t. I just like to be polite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.”  Kaname sat up and brushed herself off, slipping her shoes back on.  “I’ll go to French, for what it’s worth. But what am I supposed to tell  the teacher? That I was deliberating over whether to date my best  friend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think that would go down too well, no. If  everyone in this school did that, no one would ever go to lessons at  all.” Serané smiled. “Don’t worry, I’ll just say you were helping me  out with something important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Damn. I owe you one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  definitely do owe me one… don’t get used to this, okay? The next time I  catch you bunking, I’ll feed you to Kariya. She is not kind to people  who skip lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bet,” Kaname replied, her mind dominated by visions of Kariya coming at her with her katana. “I’ll be good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you’ve quite ruined your uniform, Kiyashiki-san will be furious,”  Serané remarked, walking towards the door. “What did you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was just lying around in grassy places, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the hands?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t talk about the hands.” Kaname stuck them in her pockets, feeling a slight twinge of pain. “It’s a little embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s very nostalgic. I remember when Kariya used to come to me beaten black and blue, thanks to her kendo…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That Kariya? She’s the fricking invincible swordmistress of the blue moon or something, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. But that was at her place in the holidays, being trained by her father’s people. They drove her very hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Does <em>anyone </em>here get along with their parents?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do, somewhat. Though I’ve yet to really clarify what Kariya is to me. They suspect, all the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t count. That’s just an argument that hasn’t happened yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’ve managed so far. We’ll see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those  are famous last words, you know,” Kaname remarked, looking up at  Serané. She tried to imagine the girl, years younger, messing up her  first and second kiss with a shorter, less ferocious Kariya. It really  didn’t work but it was very funny. She smirked despite herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something funny, Kenjou-kun?” Serané asked innocently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all. But that’s something else. Why Kenjou-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not? It suits you, Kenjou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “I wish people would stop saying that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Poor Kenjou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname walked in silence for a few moments, then changed the subject. “Well… how did you go about confessing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me? Oh, I must admit that I was a lucky girl on that front… Kariya did that for me. I just had to accept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, fine. How did <em>she </em>do it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  let’s see… I was doing homework in our room, and she was fiddling with  her bokken. She’d been distracted and irritable all week, so I asked  her what was wrong. She said nothing, and I said of course it’s not  nothing, and then we had a row… well, I ended up giving her the silent  treatment for a few days. At the end of it, she waited up outside my  geography lesson and dragged me onto the roof. Then she confessed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Trust her to make things overcomplicated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I was doing even worse than her, considering I’d already got a rough handle on my feelings and I <em>still </em>gave her the silent treatment. Actually, my reasons were in part because she wasn’t opening up as much as I wanted her too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. If you two started out so unromantically, there’s hope for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  I found her awkward bluntness very romantic… but I suppose I would.”  Serané looked down. “Any particular purpose behind your inquiry,  Kenjou-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Purely hypothetically, okay… is there a general  rule or something?” Kaname looked away awkwardly. “Engineering a row  just for that sounds a little overcomplicated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You need help  with that?” Serané shook her head. “In your hypothetical example,  Kenjou-kun, you are in the most obscenely easy position. You already  know her feelings. You could offhand it at the end of a lunchtime  conversation and after you’d repeated it three times to make sure you  weren’t joking she’d fall into your arms if you wanted her too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well… I don’t know, it’s still important, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  looked after those flowers and watered them nicely, haven’t you?”  Serané remarked. “They were a very nice gesture. I can understand your  concern, if you have such a romantic example of confession so close to  hand…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well… that sort of thing comes more easily to her. I’m not really that kind of person, so I’m not sure what to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do have it easy. I’m sure you’ll manage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still,  after all this time, I feel I should make a gesture… an apology, as  much as anything else…” Kaname closed her eyes for a moment. “You  understand her flower-language thing, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané nodded. “Quite well, actually. Shall we stop for a moment and discuss this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That might be a good idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good afternoon, Ohtori-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced up, then moved Ganymede closer, stopping by the fence. “Good afternoon, Serané-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blonde leaned on the fence, watching the other girl with interest. “I  won’t stay to ride, I have something I need to do. But I thought I’d  talk to you for a little while, while I’m here. You don’t mind, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How is Rafaela? Is she getting on alright?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  nodded. “She’s fine. She’d prefer it if you came by more often, I  think, but the rest of us keep her busy. She’s a good horse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  good to know. And how are you? With Perez-san busy with her own  matters, it must be inconvenient for you. Ganymede must be missing her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. It’s fine. We both manage. Perez-san tends to spend a little time with us in the evenings, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. Well, I wouldn’t like it if you two were growing apart. You don’t have many friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You appear to have a new one, though.” Serané leaned forwards. “Momomi Kiyashiki-san… well, you may know her as Phareli-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s very unusual of you to spend time with another girl your age,” Serané pressed. “Is there any reason for your preference?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine, isn’t it? I only see her in the mornings and at breaktime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. Well, it’s more than fine. For a problem child like you to  socialise a little more… that’s a very encouraging thing.” Serané  frowned. “But still, it’s unusual for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged and said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That kiss earlier. Just what did that mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That?  Oh, yes… that was interesting.” Amane smiled. “So many people making so  much of so little. Even you, Etoile-sama. People work in strange ways.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not making anything of it. I know enough to clarify first and conclude  later.” Serané smiled and cocked her head. “But in any case, you caused  Kenjou-kun no small amount of stress. She was quite introspective when  I talked to her earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good. I talked to her. She doesn’t have a sensible attitude, or much self-awareness. Some thinking will do her good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané chuckled. “That was unusually rude of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I’m sorry. But Kenjou-san irritates me, somewhat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Why is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She has an enormous amount of potential. She completely wastes it, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané looked thoughtful. “I suspect she would say the same about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The comparison isn’t entirely correct. Kenjou has something to fight for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you don’t? So I take it you aren’t interested in Kiyashiki-san after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané gave her a calculating look. “Aren’t you going to be more forthcoming?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can tell you about Kenjou-kun. If you are interested in the two of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stared at her for a long moment, then nodded briefly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san is not someone I care about substantially. At the same time, she is someone I could have come to care about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Serané nodded briefly. “Is that why you kissed her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I kissed her to stop them from bothering me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How does that work?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Phareli-san  by herself is quite interesting. But with Kenjou fighting possessively  over her, it becomes quite bothersome.” Amane folded her arms. “I’m  using the easiest method to make Kenjou move and so remove the problem.  That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then you’ll be alone again, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  nodded. “So that’s how it is, then. As for Kenjou-kun… if I’m not  entirely mistaken, your intentions are bearing fruit. Hopefully, things  will turn out well for them both, though you can trust teens your age  to overcomplicate things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At the very least, you’ve made her think about things.” Serané glanced at her kohai. “What do you make of those two, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  smiled again, looking a little distant. “They’re very strange. I don’t  really understand them at all, but they are entertaining. Very  passionate, but very dishonest, and even though it should be easy for  them to be happy, they overcomplicate things. It’s as you say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suspect those two are worse than most, even.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.  But they’re also frustrating at times. Kenjou doesn’t admit her own  feelings at all and lets Phareli-san do everything. Phareli-san doesn’t  bother to recognise how likely it is that Kenjou made a mistake and  keeps complaining about her own feelings.” Amane sighed. “Her opinions  on dreams were also very unsound, considering she has a fair few.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  giggled. “I see. Well, they’re both problem children, as well. Nothing  can be easy for them, even more than with normal girls your age.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki is a surprisingly good horse rider, though. That’s something.” Amane frowned. “She’s a good person. Not a <em>good </em>person, but a good person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t look very happy about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  perhaps you can explain it to me. I don’t get it at all. Why Kenjou?”  Amane shook her head dubiously. “Even accounting for Phareli-san’s  reputation, I’ve never been able to make sense of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t have a clear answer myself. But I do know why.” Serané shrugged. “Simply put, your Kenjou is not her Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane’s brow wrinkled. “You mean she’s bipolar?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  Serané sighed. “Was that a joke? Well, never mind. What I mean is that  Kiyashiki-san knows her a lot better than you do, and has probably  discovered a lot of likeable things about her along the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is everyone like that?” Amane frowned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  a greater or lesser degree, depending on the person. Kenjou is an  exceptionally defensive person, so for her it’s truly a matter of a  greater degree.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds like something of a waste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I prefer to think of it as a special gift to your special someone. But I’m just an unreconstructed romantic at heart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I’ll never know everything about someone unless I date them…” Amane  sighed. “And I’ll never know whether I want to date them unless I know  about them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Poor Ohtori-san. Well, you can always go by appearances. See if any of the girls catches your eye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “I sincerely doubt that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  toyed with her hair, glancing thoughtfully at Amane. “Well, I won’t  keep you much longer. But there’s one more thing I doubt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane gave her a neutral look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  reasons for your actions are indifferent and cold, as I’d expect of  you. But I do wonder. For you to accept and acknowledge someone who  approached you, that’s practically a first. Ever since Perez, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s just using me. I’m happy to be used.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  also what’s unusual. However I look at it, Ohtori-san, you’ve been very  acceptant of Kiyashiki-san’s impositions. For someone so impatient with  people, that’s exceptional indeed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was bored.” Amane shrugged. “Don’t read too much into it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  is that a favour to?” Serané glanced intently at her, lips curling into  a smile. “Kiyashiki-san, for being interesting? Or Perez-san, as a  favour to her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Neither. I chose this path myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re well informed, and well advised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m sure it’ll be fine.” Serané nodded. “One last question. Tell me, if  Kiyashiki-san had responded to your advance, what would you have done?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I don’t have to answer that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose not. You may not even know yourself.” Serané pushed herself up  and brushed herself off. “Well, I won’t interrupt your training any  longer. Thank you for your time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. It’s no problem.” Amane turned her horse and rode away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané watched her go reflectively, then turned on her heels and headed towards the greenhouse.</span></p>
