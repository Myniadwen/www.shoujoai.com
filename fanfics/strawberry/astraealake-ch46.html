<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane's  relationship with Hikari is pure wish fantasy in structure; the dream  that an ordinary girl can be noticed by a prince who cares for no one  else, even though she only watches the prince from afar. In Kaname's  words, though, life isn't that convenient.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Hiya, guys. Sorry I’m late.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  snorted. “It’s like five minutes until the start of lessons, you know!  Considering when we got up, that was one heck of a morning walk!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She has a point, you know.” Shion gave her a gentle smile. “We’d probably have left if Kenjou-kun didn’t insist on waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  mistake that for concern,” Kaname snapped. “I just wanted to be here in  time to chew you out. It’s annoying, you know. Aren’t you the one who  insisted that I should be a more social person? Whatever happened to  that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I am sorry I missed you guys until now, but I thought you could cope with the trauma of my absence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We managed, somehow,” Shion replied. “Not sure how, but we made it through the darkness… something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  lay it on too thick.” Amiki shrugged. “But you’re certainly smug today,  Kiyashiki. Any time you feel like getting over yourself, that’d be fine  too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’re still a sweet, well-mannered girl,” Momomi replied, lips quirking into a smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’re still a hypocrite,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As it turned out, I wasn’t being hypocritical. I ended up talking to Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You what?” Kaname snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was rather surprised too,” Momomi replied blithely, trying not to sound too smug. <em>Actually, this is way too enjoyable. </em>“But I happened to be passing by and she invited me in to help her feed the horses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Shion beamed in a way that screamed <em>I’m in on it. </em>“That’s pretty surprising… Amane is an extremely asocial person. She doesn’t ask for anything from anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s not asocial.” Olesa glanced at Shion. “She’s just choosy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  smirked. “Choosy, is it? Refresh my memory… who is the girl that she  occasionally tolerates the existence of in her year, who isn’t part of  the stable group?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shamelessly  literal, aren’t you?” Momomi teased. “Well, I actually got to talk to  her for a bit, which was surprising. Mostly about horses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s to be expected of Amane-san.” Olesa closed her eyes. “She’s very… restful, in that respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,  what? What’s so impressive, though? You spent a quarter of an hour  being bored to tears by the girl with brains made of horse manure.”  Kaname snorted. “Great going, Momomi. Now you know not to do that  again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I don’t know.” Momomi smiled thoughtfully. “She… intrigues me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell’s intriguing about her? She’s a stuck-up, diffuse absent bitch!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.  She’s… strange. I don’t really know anything about the real Amane, and  that’s interesting.” Momomi closed her eyes. “I suspect even Shion  doesn’t know much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I do know <em>some </em>things. But not  much about the inner Amane.” Shion played with her hair and gave them  innocent looks. “In short, she reminds me of you guys before I got to  know you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, while Kaname fumed. “Us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Four  people who had a persona but not a personality. It wasn’t until I got a  lot closer to you that I came to understand who you really are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you understand us, now?” Amiki challenged. “That’s a pretty big claim, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course.” Shion looked happy from the attention. “But you are all pretty simple people, at heart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. <em>Did  she offer to help us just to get close enough to learn about our  personalities? Surely not even she’s that single-minded, and we’re a  few people amongst many. I get the impression she at least wants us to  think that, though.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if you’re any different.” Kaname  folded her arms. “Eat. Sleep. Watch detective shows. Stalk people.  Sounds pretty simple to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion just gave her a smug look.  “There’s nothing wrong with being simple, you know. People are normally  one thing then another… so people who are more consistently one thing  are simple but unusual. And if the one thing they often are is unusual  in itself, then they’re even more unique. So like all people, you’re  complex and chaotic but with dominant traits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dominant traits?” Amiki demanded. “Intelligent, athletic, beautiful and cunning, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Principally,  you’re all manipulative and conniving.” Shion rested her head on the  table. “That makes you unusual and fascinating, like the villains of  Shakespeare. You’re all steeped in the qualities of Iago and Edmund.  Fun, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know what that means, but I’m getting  annoyed.” Kaname rolled her eyes. “Everyone knows stalkers are such  saints, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t take me too seriously,” Shion  remarked, waving a hand. “I just have a penchant for the theatric,  that’s all. You’re all perfectly normal…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki snorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  had taken the chance to eat much of her breakfast, but now she looked  up. “Knowing what you want, and aiming for it, that’s not so bad, is  it? I’d rather be Iago and Edmund than Othello and Lear, definitely,  because they were played for complete fools.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true  enough,” Shion agreed. “Supposedly, they were noble fools. The truth is  that people like me span things one way or the other, and made them  come out looking better than the villains. That’s not so hard to  reverse, if you’re so inclined. It’s called the art of storytelling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t tempt me, or we’ll give you a horribly skewed version of the tragedies instead of Twelfth Night,” Momomi warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be interesting,” Olesa agreed. “We should do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  for this play,” Shion warned. “If you can convince the student council,  when you’re in the higher years, perhaps. That would make an  interesting if controversial upper school play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’d have the wrong actors,” Momomi noted. “I’m trying to imagine Kariya as Iago, and it just doesn’t work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’d just have to hope for Etoiles just like you, won’t you?” Shion said lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  right, though, it’s interesting.” Kaname was looking thoughtful again.  “I mean, I don’t know those plays, but I know what you mean. Stories  are told from a certain perspective, and however bad the character is  the audience can generally at least empathise with that. Even if they  hate it, they’ll understand, where the antagonists can be  incomprehensible. Good writing helps, but in the end, it’s a matter of  which side you’re standing on, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so…” Momomi agreed, giving her friend a strange look. <em>She’s being weirdly delightful again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People  are the same, I suppose. They’re all the main characters of their own  lives, and they all empathise with themselves far more than others.  That’s just the way the world is. Provided you’re working from where  you’re standing, you can justify almost any action to yourself.  Literature just reflects that.” Kaname shrugged. “Of course,  literature’s heroes are selected by the assumed collective morality.  But that’s just what it is, assumed, there’s no absolute rule.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So Kenjou-kun is a moral relativist,” Shion noted. “I’m not particularly surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Another  thing is that people respect competence, talent and success, even if  it’s applied in immoral ways. That’s because they want to identify with  success, so they’ll forgive a successful, effective villain even if  he’s committing far more atrocities than an incompetent one.” Kaname  closed her eyes. “Basically, people don’t care how they act provided  they get rewarded for it. But it’s harder to derive benefits from  immortality, without a lot of skill and determination, and above all  the rejection of the collective morality. Simply put, society made it  that way, for obvious reasons. But it’s not innate in people. If they  could do it and get away with it, they would.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “It sounds so terrible when you say that. You’re very cynical, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “You know I’m right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  the depths of Kenjou-kun’s dark, murky and morally impaired soul aside,  breakfast is all but over,” Shion observed. “And we didn’t get to talk  about all the interesting details of Momomi’s conversation with Amane.  Lunch, perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not lunch,” Kaname grunted. “I’m tutoring her for the scholarship exams starting today. We don’t have time for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re working all lunch?” Shion asked dubiously. “Surely you’ll at least stop to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  can eat while working. Perhaps you guys don’t know because you have  people to pay your way, but this exam isn’t exactly easy. Even for me,  I have to work.” Kaname glared. “And for me, this is a critical time  not unlike Momomi and her father; if I mess up, I’m kicked out,  considering my behavioural record. I know I can’t expect the support  Momomi got, thanks to you guys, but I’d like it if you kept out of my  way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have to be so confrontational, Kaname,” Momomi  said gently. “I don’t know whether I even can help, but if I can I  definitely will. At the very least, I will work at this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Why bother?” Kaname scowled. “Can’t you just go to Amane instead? She’s smart, too. Then I’d be left in peace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  I pass and you fail, attending this school is a lot emptier than it  would be otherwise.” Momomi folded her arms. “That’s why I’ll learn  from you. For myself, and for you. I can’t believe your work ethic will  force you hard enough without me to coddle you, like always.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  even if being alone and working alone is cool, it’s not like that’s the  case.” Shion folded her arms and smiled. “Really, Kenjou-kun, you  shouldn’t say things without asking people first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is  touching, and I’ll be cheering for Kenjou so I can keep beating the  hell out of her in kendo, but… we’d better go.” Amiki stood up with  Olesa. “We’re going to be late for lessons, as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, we  have a good excuse. Kaname and Momomi watching… I’m surprised it’s not  a school sport.” Shion sighed theatrically, brushing herself off.  “Well, genius is never recognised in its own lifetime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t make us sound like birds or a painting,” Kaname warned. “That’s just too weird, even for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi said her goodbyes then went to her first lesson, History. <em>I  should actually pay attention this morning, between the exams and my  own determination to become an outstanding student. But that doesn’t  leave me with any time to think…I guess I’ll just have to get all that  over with now. </em>She smiled. <em>Principally, this is easier than I  thought. Kaname was hopping mad just because I snatched five minutes  with Amane in the morning, talking about nothing. That’s definitely  because Amane is her rival, rather than because it’s me doing the  talking to her, but still, it’s definitely a start. And now I’ve got a  compound goal, to crack Amane and to annoy Kaname as much as humanely  possible, so I’m feeling pretty good again. It’s just like I predicted  this morning, the goal doesn’t matter. I don’t think there’s any  romantic feelings in Kaname for jealousy to drag out. But I don’t care  about that any more, the process itself is challenging and fun. In a  way, it’s an exorcism. Playing Kaname to make her react requires my  concentration, and it makes me forget how beautiful and compelling she  is to be around. It makes me guilty to use her like that, which is  unusual in itself, normally I’ll use anyone on principle. But Kaname’s  always been different, I can accept that, and I’ll accept the guilt.  She’ll definitely prefer it when I’ve got these dangerous thoughts out  of my head, so I’ll forgive myself for hurting her now. </em>She touched her cheek, wondering why she was frowning in such a melancholy way. <em>That’s  right, isn’t it? It would better for everyone if I didn’t like Kaname.  I should say that even if, no, because it pains me to do so. I just  wish I knew why in my heart I’m so against making these feelings  disappear, if they bother me so much…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And in the end, she  didn’t pay much attention in lessons after all. She got a shock,  though, when she walked out of the English classroom after break and  found Kaname leaning against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her, crimson eyes unreadable. “Yo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heya.” Momomi frowned. “How did you get here so fast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Said  I wanted to go to the toilet just for break, then whined until she let  me go.” Kaname smirked and pushed herself off the wall, walking after  Momomi. “Imai-sensei is way too soft.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gave her a cunning look. “Okay, so why did you get here so fast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I could. Isn’t that reason enough? Besides that, it was even more worth  it when you saw the look on your face. That was too funny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  don’t blame me,” Momomi retorted. “I was just worried about the fact  that you were going all Shion on me. Heck, you still are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  fine if it’s just once, isn’t it? You can be just as bad, can’t you?”  Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets. “How were your lessons?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  still have concentration problems.” Momomi sighed. “I guess you can’t  magically adopt good study habits after a good half-year of laziness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha.  Well, I’ll cure you of that. At cramming, I’m pre-eminent. I can adopt  cram psychology months in advance of a test if I really have to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds really unhealthy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah, it is.” Kaname shrugged. “But I’ve never burned out before a test yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yet?” Momomi frowned. “Come to that, what about after?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t talk about after. It’s embarrassing.” Kaname looked sidelong at  Momomi and sniggered. “Don’t look so distressed. I’m screwing with you.  It’s not like I’d ever work that hard for anything, even the  scholarship exams.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re playful all of a sudden,” Momomi teased. “Are you that happy to see me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, it’s just breaktime. I like breaktime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  Well, I thought I’d go and see Amane again.” Momomi narrowed her eyes,  watching for a reaction. “Do you want to come with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her, then closed her eyes. “Sounds like a plan to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Ah… so admit it, even you’re curious about what she’s really like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not it.” Kaname grinned. “You’ll see when you get there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted at her then turned away and raised her nose haughtily. <em>Well, if you want to play it like that, I’ll play.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know what you’re doing, by the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at her friend as they walked over the grass. “Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Associating with Amane to get back at me. It’s pretty obvious, really, and a little cute too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled, undeterred. “Looks like I’m not the only one who uses lessons to do all their thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Kaname smiled, apparently pleased with herself. “I always make the most efficient use of my time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  lounging around doing nothing, for example? Very efficient.” Momomi  closed her eyes for a moment, twisting a strand of brown hair in one  hand. “In any case, you’re right in that I had intended that from the  start. But now I’ve changed my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? You’re going to stop playing your little game?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.  I haven’t talked to her for very long, but Amane is interesting enough  in her own right. Getting through to the year’s ice prince… that’s a  great challenge, isn’t it?” Momomi brushed her hair against her cheek.  “I’m going to give it my best shot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared at the trees.  “Still talking like that? I’ve no idea why you think she’s worth the  energy. It’s just boring, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t say that,  Kaname, because a lot of people probably think that about you. But  you’re a fascinating person underneath.” Momomi smiled innocently,  trying to look like Shion. “Amane’s similar, like Shion said, but  especially to you. And just like you, there was enough animation even  in her shell for me to bother digging deeper.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted.  “You’re way too patient. But Amane’s different. I was alone and said  that I wanted to be alone. Amane’s the opposite, someone who is  popular, still choosing to be alone. She’s made a real choice, so she’s  not interested in your interest. That’s why we’re not the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right, of course,” Momomi agreed. “I’ll just have to work hard, then, won’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  arrived at the paddock, and Momomi blinked several times before the  scene registered in her mind. There was already a dozen students there,  mostly Spican lower-schoolers, leaning casually on the fences and  watching Amane riding. There were probably more coming, a lot more. <em>A huge Amane fanclub.</em> <em>No,  not exactly a fanclub. Even though they’re so close, they don’t  interact with her at all. This is something like an Amane Watching  Club, just a chance to stare at her and talk amongst themselves. What  do they talk about? How wonderful she is? Or about lessons and homework  and completely normal things, but they just happen to hang out in her  less than secure abode? That’s not exactly the problem here, though.  This is a problem, and all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And that’s another difference between us,” Kaname said, her voice containing just a trace of smugness. “I know all about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So she has a few fans. It’s not like I didn’t know that.” Momomi drew herself up. “What of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  you befriended me, you were unopposed. This time, you have competition,  a lot of it, and all of it means Amane isn’t kindly disposed to  strangers.” Kaname shrugged. “If you really think she’s the same as me,  you’re an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not really very constructive, are you?” Momomi asked irritably. <em>What the hell is her problem? Is she that jealous of Amane? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s obvious, isn’t it? What’s there to distinguish you from all of  those, in her eyes?” Kaname pointed. “Look at them all leaning on the  fence, so distant from her. You’re worse than that to her.” She closed  her eyes and shook her head. “You can do what you like, but you’ll be  wasting your time. Don’t get too arrogant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gritted her teeth. “Is that a challenge?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What if it is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it is, you’re an idiot, because you’re wrong.” Momomi glared at her  friend. “We’re not the same at all, not to you, not Amane, not to  anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her with calculated disinterest. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really.” Momomi pulled her jacket off and thrust it at her friend. “Take this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grabbed it automatically, frowning. “What now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  loosened her necktie, pulling it free. “I’m not the same as them.  Compared to them, I’m an outstanding person.” She wrapped the necktie  round her hair, drawing it back into a ponytail. “I’ve sat in a room  with you for so long I’d almost forgotten that.” She pulled the  improvised ribbon tight. “But I remember now. When it comes to it, I’m  different from them. And different from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stormed  forwards. She didn’t know how Kaname was reacting and she didn’t much  care. Right now, she was just annoyed beyond belief. <em>So I can’t do it, can I? So I’m not good enough, is it? Screw that. I don’t back down. </em>She closed her eyes for a moment, collecting herself as she walked straight past the various fangirls. <em>You  taught me, Luigia. The world’s a stage, someone said that once. And  acting is all about poise. Even if I never enjoyed it, I have it; the  ballroom poise, the confidence that’s nothing to do with personal  quality and everything to do with self-belief. Arrogance…in the right  hands, that’s useful. </em>She pushed open the stable doors and looked  around, eyes narrowing when she saw a spare riding jacket hanging on a  hook. She took it and shrugged it on as if it was the most natural  thing in the world, doing up the buttons and striding up the rows of  horses. She stared at the one called Sol, then opened the door and  stepped through, grabbing the saddle from the side and beginning to  strap it to the horse. It all came back- she hadn’t forgotten anything.  Every strap secured, she patted Sol on the nose then walked round and  mounted, struggling a little with the height.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing? That’s Ohtori-san’s horse!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned her head slowly to regard the other rider in the stable. A fourth year, most likely. <em>You’re slow. You’re timid. You’re quiet. And shy people always want things to be easy, not right. </em>“What does it look like I’m doing?” She glanced down at her. “This horse needs exercise. Help me take her out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about my riding, I’m more than good enough for this.” Momomi  clicked her tongue. “Hurry up, girl. Amane-kun won’t wait forever, you  know.” <em>That’s right. It’s a lot easier to lead her out first, then  mount. But I can’t do that now, it would kill the effect. I know  exactly what I’m doing. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ri-right.” And the girl led Sol out of the stable and onto the paddock. It was that simple, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  fought hard not to smirk, keeping her nose held high. The reigns were  held lightly in her fingers, the wind blew lightly through her hair,  and the fangirls were wondering who she was and what the hell she was  doing there. But that didn’t matter. Momomi locked eyes with the only  important one. “Ohtori-san! I hope you don’t mind if I join you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Phareli-san…”  And, for a moment, Momomi saw something very rare. A surprised Amane.  The sight made her face flush with triumph. “That’s Sol, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  considered taking another, but I like this one best,” Momomi explained,  feeling exhilarated. The horse was obedient beneath her and she trotted  forwards until she was close to Amane, walking in the same direction.  “She really is magnificent, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane managed a frown. “I’d appreciate it if you asked me first…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi made a sweeping gesture with her hand, managing to embrace everyone watching them. “And have <em>them </em>ask you as well? Wouldn’t that be a bother for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… well, I’m not sure why you’re here-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  thought I’d do you a favour,” Momomi replied. “You work very hard,  Amane-san. Three horses yourself, and caring for the others as well… to  exercise them properly, that must be a lot of work for you, yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have people to help with that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  I’m one of them, right?” Momomi smiled. “But I’m indebted to you,  Amane-san. I know I said I didn’t like riding, but it was a matter of  curiosity to me all the same. Was it like I remembered? Now I know. It  feels quite good actually, though I can only do the simple things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane paused for a moment, staring at her. Then she just said “ah” and turned away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi felt a flush of triumph hit her in the stomach and race upwards, running through her entire body. <em>That’s  right, Amane, you’re no different, are you? If it’s too hard to  understand or too much bother to correct, just accept it with  indifference. You’re not a forceful personality, you just create an  illusion of superiority. It’s all too fragile, Amane, one just has to  dare. </em>She looked over the people watching with interest. “Do they bother you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked like she was wondering whether to reply. “Not as much as you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Good answer. But where’s the harm, Amane-san? I can ride a horse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a precedent, isn’t it? Even if it only looks like I’ve accepted you.”  Amane frowned. “More than that, if everyone starts to do that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’d better let it be known that I was invited,” Momomi pointed out. “If you don’t, that’s even more troublesome, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that blackmail?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good advice. I don’t really care either way.” Momomi shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  Kaname said I couldn’t be here.” Momomi smiled. “She’s been bothering  me, so I’m bothering her. You’re useful for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced at the clouds. “It works, too. She’s very aggressive, she says  she has no idea why I’d want to spent time with a dull girl like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane didn’t reply to that, falling into her habitual calm as she rode about the paddock.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  inclined to agree with her, actually.” Momomi gave the other rider a  thoughtful glance. “You’re not a very good conversationalist,  Amane-san. Weren’t you taught at polite dinner parties, like I was?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here, there’s no point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so, but that’s a matter of curiosity to me in itself. Ignoring  me, I can understand. But why don’t you talk to anyone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s tiring.” Amane glanced at her briefly. “You’re the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,  but I can talk if I want to. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here.” Momomi  touched her own cheek thoughtfully. “Well, that attitude would explain  why you like talking to Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. She told you to talk to me, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps.” Momomi smiled. “I suspect she told you to talk to me. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s a calculating girl, is she not? I’m surprised you enjoy her company.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She is… simple, to me at least. I don’t really know her, I just talk to her. But it’s less tiring to talk to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Momomi frowned. <em>Longer than before. </em>“Why is she easy to talk to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because she only wants to talk to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “I see. You know, I always thought that introverts were supposed to pair with extroverts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And for that, you’re an extrovert now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane still wasn’t looking at her, and her tone remained neutral, but it was something. “Do you mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s troublesome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it would be even more troublesome to chase me away, am I right?” Momomi  decided to take a chance. “Well, I’m not an unkind person. If I’m  annoying you, I’ll go back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned, then shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Silence is tacit consent, you know.” Momomi frowned. “As I’ve said to Kaname, several times before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane’s eyes were far away, while her fingers tapped the saddle thoughtfully. “With her, you’re an extrovert.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And to ride out here too, that’s an extrovert’s action. But you have few friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi winced, surprised by the comment. “You don’t say that kind of thing in polite conversation, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane frowned. “You’re very strange.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed at that, long and hard. Amane ignored her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eventually,  Momomi managed to compose herself. “I’m sorry… but it’s odd to hear,  coming from you. Aren’t you a little strange too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked around. “That’s why I was thinking, and I noticed something.”  She paused for a few moments, glancing at the fangirls. “This paddock…  it’s a cage. You’re here, on display, but they can’t come in. And  they’re quite separate from you. I’m going to sound like Kaname, but  that’s your life, in a way. I know, because I’m like you in some ways.  Family is the name of your god and your fate is to marry who they  order, and in the meantime you must be beautiful and inactive. No, you  can be active, you can ride horses. But you can’t be free. It must be  limiting for the horses, and for you, to be stuck in this tiny space.  It really is a cage, in a way…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A bird cage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve thought about these things.” Amane rode on without saying anything else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why a bird, in particular?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Birds are beautiful, elegant, kept things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “You’re right, I suppose. I can’t be the first person to think such things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Them.” Amane nodded at the crowds. “They’re the same, for the most part. So I don’t understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why would caged birds watch other caged birds?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know.” Momomi glanced at her. “Do you have any theories?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.” Amane frowned. “Perhaps they look up to me, because I’m excellent at fulfilling my function…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dowdy caged birds like to look at beautiful caged birds, is that it?” Momomi sighed. “You’re quite the egotist, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the one who used those words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “So I did. Well, truthfully, there’s a value in honesty. You are all those things, to them at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Etoiles are the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps  not as people, but does that matter?” Amane closed her eyes. “Again, a  cage, or a frame. A picture-frame. In people’s eyes, the things they  represent are still caged qualities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “You’re surprisingly cynical, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi cast about for something else to talk about. <em>She  finds it tiring to talk to people…well, it takes a lot of energy to  talk to her. This is worse than Kaname when we barely knew each other. </em>“Does it worry you? Being caged, so to speak?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not particularly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. So… why are you so melancholy when you talk about it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “Even if I say I’m unfortunate, it’s a lie. I’m a fortunate person. I shouldn’t complain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  because you were born into that family, that doesn’t mean you have to  follow all their orders,” Momomi said reproachfully. “I was in the same  position as you, but I managed to stay at this school, even though they  wanted to take me back. That was hard and tiring, but I did it, and I  feel better for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Why? Well, because that makes me my own person-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you resist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, right.” Momomi frowned. “You should be more specific when you ask a question. Well, I enjoy it here-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why wouldn’t I? It’s interesting, and I’ve always liked Japan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why you? When you’re lazy as you are. Like me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I had friends, didn’t I? I didn’t want to leave them behind. That  happened to Shion, you know, she had this girl called Isae-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Olesa told me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. Well, that’s a good example, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  She told me, she only became your friend well after you’d dragged you  into helping her.” Amane patted Starbright’s flank idly. “And that  before that, there was only Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I suppose, but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was it Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  rubbed the back of her head awkwardly, surprised at the interrogation.  “It was a lot of reasons, okay? But Kaname was one of them, I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane was silent for a moment, then she spoke again. “Why her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s with all the questions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t understand, that’s all.” Amane closed her eyes. “Kenjou is  violent, bad-tempered, ill-mannered, socially awkward and extremely  difficult to deal with. She isn’t like us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “Not exactly. But that doesn’t mean I’ll let you say those things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s different from you, she’s had a much harder life-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does that make my words any less true?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t just judge someone without looking at where they came from. It’s an arrogant simplification. For Kaname-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?”  Amane closed her eyes. “Even if you can understand why she’s like that,  why would you want to spend time with her? Isn’t she just a low person?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you wouldn’t understand, because you’ve never bothered to understand  anyone!” Momomi said aggressively. “So what if she’s like that? That’s  just her being defensive. She has a lot of wonderful characteristics,  as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really!” Momomi scowled. “She’s  tough, loyal, dependable, clever, witty, and strong. All those things  and more. Even though she’s had a hard life, even though she was more  caged than we ever were, she broke out and she lives her own life. She  can be stubborn and annoying, but she’s proud and principled and  honourable! She’s not low at all, she’s far more noble than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane looked away indifferently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  you dare ignore me! What the hell do you know? This is why she hates  you! You have none of her problems, you have everything she wants, but  you don’t even care!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that my fault?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps it  isn’t, but you can’t insult her or call her a low person! That’s just  unforgivably arrogant.” Momomi ground her teeth. “She’s right, too.  This is why you don’t befriend anyone. You’re just a stuck-up,  aristocratic idiot with a superiority complex!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane closed her eyes. “No doubt about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi choked back the next insult she was going to throw. <em>Did she just…agree with me when I said that? Is she really so indifferent that she doesn’t even care what I say?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still in love with Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blushed. “Wh… what? What the hell are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was worried. It would be difficult if you were really coming after me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  defending her just makes me a decent friend! Love doesn’t come into  that! More to the point, do you have to sue such a dramatic word? What  do you know about it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane checked her watch. “We should  go back to the stables and brush them down. There’s only two minutes  left until the end of break.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded, feeling shaken. “Right.” <em>That…  was that all planned out? Baiting me by insulting Kaname until I  snapped? No, more than that, she’d taken control of the conversation  long before then, and she was always leading me to this. Was it just a  coincidence that we ended up like this, or what? If I wanted to prove,  I’d do it that way as well, but Amane shouldn’t be the same as me. On  the other hand, what do I know about her? Perhaps she really was  leading me all along, even if she sounds slow she’s very smart and she  is a confident person. But what would the point be? Just to confirm my  feelings? And she’s so firm about it, as well, firmer than I am! Isn’t  that just inappropriate? But-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there a problem?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Momomi replied automatically. “Not at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane turned away. “Kenjou looks troubled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at Kaname. It was hard to tell over the distance, but she looked angry. <em>Damn,  I’d love to talk about this to her so I can hear her opinion, but I  can’t, can I? Not without sounding like I’m gloating… wait, isn’t that  the idea in the first place?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane dismounted and led  Starbright into the stable. “For someone who’s rusty, you’re a  surprisingly able horsewoman, Phareli-san. You may borrow Sol at your  leisure, if you want to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… thanks…” Momomi replied uncertainly. “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  safe. Perez-san is the same.” Amane offered her hand, red eyes looking  up at Momomi’s flustered face. “If it isn’t too annoying, it doesn’t  bother me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi took her hand hesitantly, sliding out of the  saddle and landing awkwardly, before hurriedly snatching her arm back.  “Thank you, Amane-san.” She managed a smile. “You’re surprisingly  forwards, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line.” Amane shrugged off her  riding jacket and swapped it for her white Spica uniform. “You should  get your own. They aren’t expensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will.” Momomi hung her  borrowed coat up and pulled the necktie out of her hair. She shook her  long brown tresses out, before beginning to redo the tie. “Just tell me  one thing, Amane-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you want from me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane paused for a moment. “This is not a zero-sum situation.” Then she walked away, leaving Momomi to watch and wonder.</span></p>
