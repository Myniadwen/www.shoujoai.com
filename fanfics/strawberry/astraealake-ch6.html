<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I tried a different dialouge style for this chapter, in deference to review advice. Tell me how I did.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  breathing was very regular. She was definitely slumbering lightly,  without snoring. If she did snore, it would no doubt be a genteel  mockery of a snore. <em>It’s pretty ironic. She’s the one going through  a major crisis, one that will probably determine the course of her life  from now and forever. But I’m the one who can’t sleep. </em>Kaname  glanced across the room, just about picking out Momomi’s features in  the half-dark. Her hair fell in thick, untidy locks around her, spread  across the pillow. Her baby-like face moved gently as she breathed,  making her seem far too young for her true years. It was a childish,  sweet face, that made her cutely petulant when she was frowning and  radiant when she smiled. <em>In short, a face that bears no relation to  her personality. In a very weird way, that entirely suits her  personality… she’s the one who deceives people. Even now, though, I  find it hard to work out why she doesn’t play on that prettiness and  innocence more. She could take the whole school in, but she doesn’t.  Does she really trust no one, not even to draw them close with lies?  Oh, I’m exactly the same, but I was born to be like that. On her, it  feels like something’s actually wasted… what exactly am I meaning,  anyway? My head hurts.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed and looked at the ceiling, closing her eyes for a moment. <em>I  feel stupid. Even so, there’s too much to think about. Why did all that  have to happen in one day? It feels… unfair. Somehow. That’s a stupid,  childish expression of frustration when the world throws something  unexpected your way. In a way, this should be fun. Showing up a bunch  of aristocrats is always good. Plus this way, Momomi will need me, just  a little, I know that. It’d be very easy to call this a game I’m  playing, to kill time. I may even have told her that. But I’m up this  late and thinking, because I’m afraid. That’s right. This sense of  unease, discomfort with the future, that’s definitely what you’d call a  kind of fear. It’s playing on my mind and nerves. Because I don’t want  to lose. Really, genuinely, and totally. At the same time, I’m afraid  of that fact that I’m afraid to lose. Even when I lost to Amane, it  didn’t matter really, when I never cared. Now I’ve started to care and  that means it’s far easier to hurt me, and I live a life like this  because I don’t want to be hurt. Isn’t Momomi the same? Exactly the  same. But she can sleep, and I can’t. That’s one of the things that  worry me most… at the same time, why is it important?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  scowled, rolling over and pressing her head into the pillow, trying to  block out her thoughts. But they continued to spiral, dozens of  electrically spreading thought, contradicting each other moment by  moment, and thoughts about thoughts that was sensation. <em>I feel like  my life was, perhaps, one of Momomi’s mirrors. A very smooth,  reflective surface, that took in nothing at all, but turned it all back  flawlessly. Only she broke it, and now there are shards of glass  everywhere, and light reflecting off a thousand different facets and  scattering that simple invulnerable purpose everywhere. I’ve always  walked in a straight line, but now it’s fading, breaking and  diffracting. </em>She smiled despite herself. <em>Momomi’s right, </em>she thought wryly. <em>I  can’t do figurative language at all. Even so, though, I’m surprised.  I’ve grown used to being alone, and even when I’m not alone, I keep my  mind apart. I thought even if I had to tolerate Momomi just a little,  I’d be able to do that. It seems that friendship is more dangerous than  that, to someone weak like me. But, can you even call it that?  Friendship? We love to hate each other, and that’s hardly friendship,  but neither of us are as simple as the caricature we project to each  other and the world. Before, perhaps, I was that. But now it feels like  I’m playing a role because I myself don’t understand the more complex  truth and so I stick to the simpler me because that’s all I know… but  that’s not it, as I say things the simple me would never say, and they  seem right even though they sound wrong. All I can do is go with it.  I’m not complex like Momomi, or strong like her. I’ve never been  anything but myself, and I’ve always been simple, until now. I can’t do  anything but trust my instincts, but I can’t know that those instincts  can keep me safe any longer. So I don’t know what to do at all. I’m  useless and weak like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname decided to stop thinking before she went any further. <em>That  kind of idiot self-doubt could go on all night. My life was a lot  easier when I had no doubts at all. Only I did have doubts, and I still  do… no. That’s enough. It’s simple, isn’t it? If we win, I can think on  it. Just like Momomi won’t have a reason to not be popular after that,  I’ll have a chance to think and act. If we lose, I won’t regret keeping  this kind of idiot doubt locked inside. Only I might, after all… </em>she laughed again, softly, then muffled it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re noisy,” Momomi whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname almost tripped over herself as she twisted to look at Momomi. “Did I wake you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wasn’t asleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  put a finger on her lips, a gesture that somehow carried across the  dark room. “I’m the deceptive one, right? I couldn’t sleep at all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You too,” Kaname winced. “I thought you were deep asleep!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t want you to think I was afraid,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That stilled Kaname’s voice in an instant. Then she sighed. “So you couldn’t sleep either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked at the ceiling. “Yeah. I guess it isn’t as easy as we pretend it to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s easy!” Kaname exploded. “We’re just afraid to lose. But we’ll win!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not so loud. The sisters will hear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted quietly. “I think we both know that the sisters let others get away with more than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Momomi murmured. “And you’re afraid to lose, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  turned her head, looking annoyed. “It’s just to win. I don’t like to  lose, and I won’t lose, not to someone like your father.” Even she had  to admit that her words sounded hollow. It was always like this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled slightly. “I’m glad. It reminds me that I have a chance, with someone like you on my side.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course,” Kaname said, closing her eyes for a moment. “It’s not that I’m doubting myself. But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps Kaname is worried because she has to look after me as well, and I’m a weak little girl?” Momomi suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something  like that.” Kaname looked guarded. “You’re not completely useless. But  having objective aside from oneself is a novel experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think I know what you mean.” Momomi chuckled softly. “In fact, I know I know what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If we make mistakes together, it cancels out. Didn’t you say something along those lines?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not that exact phrase, but that was the spirit,” Momomi agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a moment’s silence. Kaname suppressed a sigh. <em>First one then the other, we mess with each other, or maybe both at once. </em>“So we’ll get by.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Momomi was silent for a moment. “I guess you’ve done this before, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When you came here, that was your freedom,” Momomi said. “So it’s possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I suppose so. But that was breaking away from a mother who was happy to be shot of me, and a father who had been shot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My situation’s a little less convenient in that respect,” Momomi said thoughtfully, looking up at the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be too jealous,” Kaname said. “You do have a family to go back to. Your sister, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Momomi whispered. “But really, I don’t know…” she sighed. “It’s  a hard feeling to place, but home was never somewhere where I could be  safe or happy. I’m sure you know that feeling. If you don’t have that,  it seems to me it doesn’t matter how many family members you have. It’s  all the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname thought for a moment, then shrugged.  “That’s right. But it’s not like I’ve ever been secure or happy  anywhere else. Except this room, perhaps, just a little. But it’s a  tiny little boxy space and the outside of the school is definitely not  the place to feel safe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned to face her for a moment.  “Funny how alike we are in that. But you’re right, in a way. Its not  like I want to be away from home forever… but I don’t want to go home.  Does that make sense?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just…” Momomi sighed. “When you came here, it felt good, right? To do something on your own?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  felt happy,” Kaname said. “But it also brought home to me how little I  had, except everything I could seize for myself. You have something, so  you should think more on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think about sis, sometimes. I wonder what she’d want.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  have to look after yourself.” Kaname stretched, pretending disinterest.  “If your sister’s anything like you, she’d recognise that. But you’re  not me. You have to think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Momomi said. “But I can’t  live like that. I don’t want this. I want to be… like you. To know that  everything I have is everything I could take- it’s my dream. Ever since  I met you, I knew that. Before, I just knew I hated my life without  ever knowing why…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smiled. <em>We’re both so stupid. </em>“Never let yourself regret that. But if you can hold onto that, then we can win.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We won’t lose,” Momomi said softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And after we win, things will be different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Such a sweet, mysterious voice. A promise rich with promise. </em>Kaname was awake long after the brown-haired girl had fallen into genuine slumber. <em>Just a test… just a test. Always a test. Right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  dressed in silence, that comfortable silence that was entirely theirs.  This time Kaname was a little more careful with her hair and necktie.  Then they left together, eating swiftly and silently. When everything  had been planned and said, there was nothing that needed to be  articulated. In a way, those moments were relaxing. A sense of purpose  was as good as routine, after all. Kaname watched Momomi, and waited.  This was Momomi’s battle, after all. The girl’s eyes darted across the  canteen, picking out Shion, a reserved figure at the edge of a group of  chatty third-years. “Let’s go,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now.” Momomi stood and dragged Kaname up by the shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re feisty today.” Kaname followed her, still slightly sleepy. So much excitement this early in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Things  to do, and little time.” Momomi tapped Shion on the shoulder, ignoring  the girls who had turned to stare at them. “We need to talk to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  third-years gave her hostile looks, but Shion just closed her eyes and  smiled. “10:45, by the large elm by the lake. Is that alright?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine,” Momomi said tensely. “Don’t be late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Remember to go to your lessons.” Shion smiled even more luxuriously, cocking her head. “There’s no excuse not to do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.” Momomi turned and walked away without another word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked back to see Shion glance back at her, running a hand through her  blonde hair and smiling ironically. Then she walked after Momomi,  catching up. “We’re really going to lessons?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  right,” Momomi sighed. “We have no choice. What can we achieve right  now by skipping them? The Etoiles sure as hell won’t be doing that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Remember. 10:45, the elm. We’ll both need to be there; I intend to promise you as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.” Kaname paused by the door and looked round. <em>Yep.  Everyone’s looking at us. I hate that. They’ve probably heard about  Momomi, haven’t they? What’s it to you, you aristocratic twerps? </em>She glared, feeling her body stiffen, then stepped quickly through the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They parted ways, heading to their morning lessons. <em>I  hate to admit it to myself, but today of all days I can only despise  the facts that they were in different classes. As it was, I can’t  concentrate at all. No, I’d probably be even more distracted if Momomi  was near her. How is the girl taking it? What is she feeling? Was she  fretting nervously, drifting through the droning of the sister with her  mind on these stupid, introspective thoughts? More and more, I compare  myself to Momomi and wonder. More and more, Momomi is becoming my frame  of reference. If Momomi is feeling the same fears, facing the same  uncertainty, it’s okay. Other people don’t matter. It isn’t like anyone  cares about me. If they noticed the way she was, they didn’t show it.  I’m alone. I’ve always found that comforting. But Momomi would care. I…  care about Momomi. That was why it’s okay just so long as she is the  same. As long as Momomi doesn’t think I am stupid, it’s fine. And, more  and more… Momomi is eclipsing Amane as the one person I care to measure  myself against. Am I lowering my standards now? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked. <em>No,  Momomi is worth far more than Amane. Maybe she doesn’t have that girl’s  absolute edge, in studies and in sports, maybe she’s not as popular,  perhaps she can’t call herself my absolute rival, perhaps she isn’t as  perfect, but… Momomi has a battle to fight, and people important to  her. Do you even understand, Amane? What it is to struggle? Do you know  what it means to work and suffer for your ideals against the world? Or  are you just too sheltered to ever know? You’ve never wanted anything,  because you’ve always had everything. That’s why you’re so indifferent.  Perhaps I can’t beat you, you snooty little bitch, but Momomi’s  stronger than you’ll ever be. From her background, she had to fight.  From the same background, you’ve never done anything but graciously  accept everything offered you, and a lot of the time, you don’t even do  that. Is that what it means to a be chosen one? Society likes fixing  the card games of life…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou! Pay attention!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Sister,” Kaname muttered, bowing her head and returning to work.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  glad I’m worthy of your valuable attention,” the Sister said, to  general amusement that had nothing to do with wit and everything to do  with Kaname’s unpopularity. Well, she was used to that. “Now, where was  I… the critical moment of the campaign was when Napoleon split the  allied armies. They had anticipated an attack on Mons, which would have  allowed for a lightning attack on Brussels, splitting the British and  the Prussian forces apart and driving them to the sea. Instead, he  aimed to seize a crossroads known as Quatre Bras and split the allies  apart, by cutting off their routes of communication. He was partially  successful in this, splitting the allied armies apart. It appears that  the initial intelligence reports of the march on Quatre Bras were  disregarded by cavalry officers due to the anticipation of an attack on  Mons, and never reached the British High Command.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Misdirection, poor communication, and a little boldness. </em>Kaname sighed. <em>I’ve  heard about so many battles. They’re all the same, though, just the  same human strengths and flaws being exploited and exaggerated until  they determine the fate of nations. It feels almost stupid.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“However,  Quatre Bras was barely held on the first day. This was despite the  unreliability of the Dutch allies present, many of whom considered  themselves French. Outflanked with the retreat of the Prussians,  however, who had faced the majority of Napoleon’s army, the Anglo-Dutch  forces were obliged to retreat to the village of Waterloo. On the  following morning, they made a stand in the face of Napoleon’s main  army…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname drifted away again. She’d heard it all before.  She’d always reckoned she’d make a good general. She could think  straight and see her object clearly at all times, it was what she did.  Maybe Momomi could do the trickery and stuff… but that was something to  do. She looked down and picked up her pen, switching to a fresh page.  This was a war, after all. It was time for General Kenjou to plan her  campaign. She started by listing words across the page, their allies  and enemies. That made sense to start.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Me. Handsome,  incredibly intelligent, strong, uninhibited, experienced with the  scholarship exam…has no friends, social skills or money. </em>Kaname sighed. <em>More willing than useful, truthfully.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Momomi.  Beautiful, intelligent, weak, uninhibited, a great liar… has no friends  or money and uncertain social skills. Not so different from me, despite  the leagues of distance that separate our pasts.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked up surreptitiously. The best thing about this was that it looked like she was studiously writing notes. <em>Shion,  who’ll be of uncertain use. The Etoiles, who are very important. Serané  who loves family and is reasonable and sympathetic. Kariya who is  fierce, independent and doesn’t like me at all. The Sisters, especially  the Superior, who mostly dislike us. Momomi’s family, who are the main  foes. Her sister, who might come around. Her mother, who might also  agree while remaining useless. And… her father. The belligerent and  stubborn final boss. Oh, and list that horrible enemy “term fees” along  with all the others. It’s a long list and I don’t like anything on it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked down at her scattered list, feeling vaguely pleased with herself. <em>Now,  think like Napoleon. No, Napoleon lost, think like Napoleon’s love  child with a female Wellington from a parallel universe. Now that’d  make one heck of a story. Napoleon and Amy Wellesly, a tale of tragic  love. But that’s off the point…misdirect, indeed. Divide and rule. But  allies make you strong, that’s how the British and Prussians won.  Weaken the enemies and their will to fight. Set them against each  other. Don’t just recruit allies; make their battle your battle. That’s  what war is. I won’t lose.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She worked out her plans in her  head and on paper until break time, trying to work out how Momomi would  react to each suggestion, and how practical they would be with the  resources at their disposal. She tried to work out their priorities,  too, what came first and what came later. It was difficult to work with  so little information, but this was only a preliminary. Momomi had more  information on her family. Shion was an enigma but, all things being  well, would eventually show her hand. It wasn’t going to be easy or  complete. Even if everything went flawlessly, they’d need luck and  improvisation. This would merely be the best way to maximise their  chances. In Kaname’s experience, all plans came down to that, in the  end. But the process reminded her of that day, almost two years ago  now. She’d realised that primary school was ending. She’d realised the  dreary future that lay ahead of her, in an under-funded school stuffed  with drug addicts, nymphomaniacs and vandals. <em>And that was just the teachers. </em>So  she’d done research and thought things through and planned something,  for the first time in her life. It didn’t come very naturally to her,  and she was acutely aware that her plans tended to have rough edges.  But it still felt good. It made her feel in control again. <em>I wonder whether Momomi has something similar. We can compare notes.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  threw her books into her bag the moment the bell rang, shouldering it  and racing out of the classroom. Not for the first time she cursed the  excessively long corridors they had at Astraea, carrying on down the  stairs. She thought she heard a Sister shout, but pretended not to  hear, shoving past an alarmed first-year. Break was way too short. They  had far too much to talk about. She ran out the door of the main  building and charged up the path, dodging out of the way of anyone too  inconvenient. Then she reached the verge of the forest, ducking inside  and sprinting between the tightly spaced trees. She was an excellent  runner, and the experience exhilarated her enormously. The track club  had actually solicited her a few times, usually by senpais who hadn’t  heard of her fearsome reputation. She’d never accepted, of course. It  was too much like hard work. But just occasionally she wondered how  good she’d be if she actually applied herself to something outside her  studies. <em>Yeah, right. As if I have the time with my studies. If you  pay stupendous sums of money to be here, you have time for  extracurricular activities, but honour students can’t afford to be that  casual. </em>She jumped past another tree and almost crashed into someone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou-san?” Serané said, her eyes widening slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname slid to a halt. “What are you doing here at this time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané cocked her head, resting a hand on her cheek. “You shouldn’t run so fast, you know. You almost ran me over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” Kaname said. “Gotta go.” She turned and moved on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané fluttered her eyelids slightly, watching the girl run. “Such a strange girl,” she murmured, stepping on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname heard that, gritting her teeth, but bore with it. <em>What the hell was she doing? Whatever. No time. I’m there. </em>She  slid to a halt in front of the elm, a single lonely tree in the middle  of a slight clearing in the forest. It was a popular spot whenever  people wanted to be alone, or more generally, alone with someone else.  Which was one of the reasons why she’d run there. Hopefully Serané  wouldn’t spot where she was going and think something strange.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of  course, she was the first one there. When she actually stopped to  think, she wasn’t sure why she’d run so fast in the first place. Now  she was out of breath. It was probably something to do with being  cooped up so long in a classroom, when she wanted to get out and do  things. Even so, it was pretty embarrassing. She stuck her back against  the tree and tried to get her breath back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion turned up a few  minutes later, rather more composed. “Kenjou-san,” she said politely,  nodding. “Kiyashiki-san isn’t here yet, I take it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right.” Kaname folded her arms. “You know, you’re a lot more polite when you’re not calling us sad losers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  never polite,” Shion replied. “But it’s moot. I hope Kiyashiki-san has  something interesting to say. This is to do with the rumours of her  being taken out of Astraea, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s already a rumour?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Shion said, closing her eyes. “For those who know where to  listen, there’s nothing that can be hidden. It’s true, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right,” Kaname admitted. “Honestly, how did this happen? It was only yesterday we heard about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  guess is that Kariya talked. Serané is the conscientious ones who would  deal with these things, but Kariya is talkative. Besides, we knew  something was up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “Christ, why did she even tell that bag of hot air? It makes things so difficult for us. The stupid bitch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bed talk, possibly,” Shion said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was speculation I wasn’t ready for, thanks a lot.” Kaname closed her eyes and trying to scrub her mental retina.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speaking  of that, you and Kiyashiki-san have been getting on better recently,”  Shion said. “I heard someone saw you together by the lake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was just a trip outside for me and my roommate. Nothing more. So don’t think disgusting things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Annoyed,  Kaname fell into the silence that she was most comfortable with,  closing her eyes and pretending that the other girl present didn’t  exist. The third-year already felt like an annoying intrusion, someone  that spoke far too readily of the society of Astraea. Something she was  all too willing to shun, personally. So it was definitely annoying. <em>Who the hell cares what she thinks, anyway? Stupid loner girl.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion herself looked equally comfortable with the silence, leaning against the tree a few feet from Kaname and closing her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Suits  me just fine. Useless blonde bitch. I don’t know why Momomi thinks  she’ll be any help, a girl like this. What talent does she have? </em>Kaname frowned. <em>Well,  fine. Even I have to admit it sounds like she has a knack for  information gathering. But is that worth making a pact with this devil?  She’ll want something in return, and however I look at it, it’s going  to be a bother. Something for Spica, whatever the hell that means. I  just want to go through life without having to fight battles that don’t  involve me. Why should I care about something as intangible as a mere  school? </em></span></p>
“No Kiyashiki,” Shion noted. “She’s taking her time.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But I’ve already betrayed all that, haven’t I? For Momomi, that’s  either for her sake or my sake. It would be even more painful to  believe that I’m doing that for my sake. Either way, this is a battle  I’ve chosen to fight. To win, I’ll do whatever becomes necessary. </em>She  didn’t tell Shion that, though. She’d definitely be sure to discourage  the girl if the topic was ever broached. Perhaps she could wriggle out  of it somehow. In the meantime, she wouldn’t dignify Shion was a reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  five minutes, however, it became impossible to ignore, especially as  Shion was starting to check her watch in a very pointed fashion. “I’m  sure she’s just held up by something,” Kaname said irritably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t say a word,” Shion replied serenely. “But now you’ve broached  the subject, she is very late under the circumstances. Did she get lost  or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not my problem, I suppose.” Shion flicked a stray strand of hair over her shoulder. “It’s not my problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You aloof bitch,” Kaname growled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you any different?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gritted her teeth, restraining herself. <em>So annoying. </em>It  would be way too easy to punch some sense into this girl, but she  couldn’t do that. She had to consider Momomi now. That was pretty  inconvenient at times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, this isn’t an impressive-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going,” Kaname said, pushing herself off the tree.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to find her.” Kaname spoke as if it was obvious. “And I’ll drag her back here by the ear if need be. Happy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you <em>are </em>worried about her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Worry has nothing to do with it. I’m just annoyed that she made me wait.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  left the glade at a slow walk, not looking back at the blonde girl. She  gave herself ten seconds, stopped when they passed too fast, and  repeated the process, making herself count slower. Then she broke into  a run.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, you’re going somewhere,” Akimi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yes.” Momomi leaned back, trying to look unconcerned. “That’s why I’m walking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smartarse. You’re leaving the school, though, I hear? Finally worked out you don’t belong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re mistaken. I’m not leaving. Sorry to disappoint you in that respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, what a shame.” Akimi narrowed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  tried to walk on but the girl stepped in front of her, expertly shoving  her against a tree. “Was that strictly necessary?” she said as lightly  as she could manage. Her eyes flickered but the other girls cut her off  from any possible retreat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re a mouthy one. But that’s all you are. Talk. You don’t have anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  put on her best mocking smile. “I’m satisfied that I’m not like you. At  least I have a talent. I’d hate to be a completely plain girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akimi slapped her, almost lovingly. “What right has a freak like you have to condescend to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m not the one harassing an innocent girl five to one,” Momomi  riposted, ignoring the stinging pain on her cheek. She earned another  slap for her trouble.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really shouldn’t go to the forest all alone, you know. Trees are very dangerous things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  eyes flickered between the girls, resting on Olesa for a moment. She  stood slightly apart from the others on several levels. Another  half-European. Quiet, cunning, ostensibly innocent. As a master of the  false image to another, she had to recognise the girl’s skill. Olesa  was the real enemy here. She managed to slip one hand into her pocket,  closing it around her camera phone. “Why are you doing this?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Akimi  laughed at her. “Do you really want to know? This is revenge for what  your fucked up girlfriend did to us. Besides, a freak like you should  be punished.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But why do you bother to come back again and  again?” Momomi laughed. “Kaname hurts you every time, you’ve never  beaten her outright. And it’s only a matter of time before you’re  caught.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Sisters are way too complacent. Besides, no one’s going to stick their neck out for someone like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the ones sticking your necks out, though,” Momomi said thoughtfully. “What’s the point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because we enjoy it? Isn’t that obvious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You enjoy having your nose broken?” Momomi said, raising her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time, Amiki punched her in the stomach, making her double over. “You sure are noisy,” she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  really, you’re just being used, because you’re pathetic. You’re just  used by someone who doesn’t care to get her own hands dirty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  ignored her. “And I do wonder why I’m targeted. What value is there in  attacking a loser like me?” She looked at Olesa with challenging eyes.  “I suppose that’s a way of acknowledging me as a dangerous rival. I’m  flattered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get too up yourself, you bitch,” Amiki slammed  her hard against the tree and slapped her repeatedly. The other girls  merely watched. Momomi had no idea whether they found the spectacle  distasteful or entertaining. As it was, she tried not to react too  much, but couldn’t help a gasp from escaping her lips as the pain  continued. Amiki was good at what she did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She fell to her knees, choking back tears. <em>Come on. Come on now, damnit! </em>Amiki  slapped her in the face, knocking her over. She pushed herself, looking  up at Olesa again. “And when I’m going, too,” she managed. “Are you  this afraid of me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell is she talking about?” Amiki said, turning to her friend. “Anything important, Perez-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  pressed the buttons blind, praying silently that she was getting it  right. “She knows,” she gasped. “She knows what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing,” Olesa said quietly. “Just nonsense. She’s trying to distract you, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  isn’t nonsense,” Momomi said. That should be it. She’d catch  “distracted”, hopefully. “I’m not a target that’s been selected at  random.” <em>Acknowledge me, you bitch.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t be talking,” Amiki said. But it looked like she thought that further effort was unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it you want? Why do you see me as a rival? Exams? Popularity? The  student council? Etoile?” Momomi managed a cracked smile. “I must say  I’m flattered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa said nothing, looking at her in an odd way,  as if she was mad. Sometimes Momomi wouldn’t whether she was. Perhaps  she was totally misjudging the situation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she didn’t think  so. “But, all the same, it’s pathetic that you pick on a target like  me,” Momomi said. “That just shows you don’t have the strength to  assert yourself after real threats. But I’ll give you credit for seeing  that I could be so much more than I am. Shall I oblige you? Shall I  rise to your challenge?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no challenge,” Olesa said. “Only your delusions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This girl, this girl, this girl! </em>“And Kaname? How does she fit into your world? Is she your main rival? You’ve been after her a lot longer than you chased me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa said nothing. The others weren’t doing anything, simply because Momomi’s apparently mad ravings were entertaining.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I can guess,” Momomi continued. “Etoile is a position for two, after  all. A pair, joined by love and perfection. Kaname shines a lot  brighter than either of us, so it would be fine to bathe in her glow.  Except she has such a troublesome attitude… wouldn’t it be so much  easier if she feared you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa frowned, looking bemused.“You’re still nonsensical. You shouldn’t strain yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really? I think that’s it. Or something else. It could be Amane,  couldn’t it? She’s even more perfect to most people, and you can’t deny  Kaname’s obsession. Eliminating your rivals might be sensible, but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa quirked an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’ll  never acknowledge you.” Momomi savoured the words. “Never ever. Amane  is an untouchable star, a star alone. She’s way beyond your reach.  Amane’s a better match for her, and even that will never work. It’s  hopeless, Olesa, you’re the one who’s delusional. There’s no way anyone  will touch Amane’s heart. Least of all a minor, scheming two-faced liar  like you. Didn’t you know? The truth is something you find in the  light.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Silence, then Olesa turned away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Riding on Amane’s  horse,” Momomi whispered. “Standing by her. Holding her hand. Using her  power, her radiance, reflected on yourself, because you aren’t that  great alone. Or perhaps you really have fallen in love with her. You  want to be with her and steal her glory. Because of that, you hate us  both. Kaname’s who’s closer to being Amane than you can ever be. And  me. Smarter, more beautiful and a better liar, someone who knows what  you are. Perhaps that. Or with Kaname or me or anyone else, because it  has to be with someone and it can’t be you alone, you’re not that  popular… I’m smart enough to know it’s just a dream. You’ll never be  Etoile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s being annoying,” Olesa said quietly. “Hurt her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  ma’am,” Amiki said, turning back to Momomi and cracking her knuckles.  “You do talk some crap. Done embarrassing yourself now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m done.” She tried to stop her body from shaking as euphoria flashed through her. <em>Yes! I got you. I got you, you little bitch. Checkmate. Checkmate!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked up, the triumph in her eyes fading slightly. Unfortunately, that victory wouldn’t stop the pain that was to come.</span></p>
