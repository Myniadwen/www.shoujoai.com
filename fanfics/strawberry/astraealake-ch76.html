<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Around a year ago, perhaps a little more, I watched the end of Strawberry Panic and thought, broadly, <em>sucks to be those two evil hot lesbian girls. </em>Of  course, it just plain sucks to be Miyuki or Tamao, but Shizuma didn't  deserve Miyuki and Tamao never worked for me anyway. So I thought I'd  throw together a nice 5000 word oneshot providing Kaname and Momomi,  once I could remember their names, with some plot closure.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once  I'd written 5000 words, however, it wasn't enough. So I thought I'd do  a little 10-15 chapter run as a character study, exploring their past  and possible motivations. I'd spend perhaps 3-5 chapters on their  second year and move on, up to the present and then the future.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once  I'd written 25,000 words, I got bored and went off to do something  else. Six months later, I came back and decided to pick the story up  again. After a while, I noticed I probably <em>wasn't </em>going to get  past their second year. So I decided to just write that instead. But  that hasn't been neat, either. I can say with absolute honesty that on  every round number since chapter 40 I said the next round number would  be the end of it. So much for that. Astraea Lake is essentially a case  of project creep gone critical, but that's okay. I should have known  better than to think I could control the energy of characters like  these.</span></p>

“So? What are you  going to do now?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, looking  up at a very blue sky. Below them, a very blue lake glittered. “I  don’t know. I’ll have to think about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you? Do you  have anything in mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not in particular,”  Kaname admitted. “Really, we didn’t make any plans for what came  after. One way or the other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t it ironic,  though? We didn’t even get on that damn stage. It’s been four  years and we still didn’t even get as far as that stage…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It can’t be helped.  Shion was against us from the start, and she’s still a powerful  person. And even if we wielded a lot more influence than Amane, she  made far less enemies, because she was a strictly neutral person.  Like that, we’d always be a controversial choice, and divisive  figures-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that,”  Momomi replied testily. “Don’t insult my intelligence, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if I can  understand the logic and the politics, it’s a very long time and a  lot of effort to go to waste, without anything to show for it at all.  I can’t be happy about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. But it’s  not important. It’s just a title, isn’t it? There’s no meaning  in it. The Stars… say that to yourself and show me the sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s obvious,  isn’t it? The sense is in the stars that shine, where everyone  looks at them.” Momomi tilted her head, looking calmly at Kaname.  “In other words, the title of most outstanding student. To be the  best, not for any rhyme or reason but for its own sake, is a  motivation you understand. For as long as I can remember, Kaname,  that’s been your fascination. I’ve sacrificed a lot for that, so  don’t disown it now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. But you were  the same. Don’t portray yourself as a victim strung along by wicked  old me, the truth isn’t that convenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know.” Momomi  chuckled. “You know, perhaps talking isn’t very useful after all.  We know each other too well; there’s no meaning in it at all. The  only question is whether or not we want to accept that meaning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If it’s said out  loud, it’s something that will have to be accepted. Perhaps.”  Kaname sighed discontentedly. “But honestly, this kind of life  doesn’t satisfy me at all. It doesn’t suit us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Defeat doesn’t suit  us, Kaname. But we’ve lost.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could care less  about that. Didn’t you learn anything from our race with Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was there to  learn? Asides from your affections-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Etoile is a title  for two, even though it’s a singular concept. For as long as Amane  remained apart, it didn’t matter how outstanding she was. She  didn’t have any right to claim that title. It’s not just the most  outstanding student, but a student who can cultivate that kind of  connection…” Kaname smirked. “Even if the second one isn’t  very outstanding at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hope that wasn’t  me you were referring to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you stupid?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat up, running a  hand through her hair and looking down at the lake. “Sometimes I  wonder…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sat up, sighing  and following her gaze. “That bad, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So the Etoile is a  position for two… that much is obvious. But, if I was to be bitter,  then that’s pretty damning in itself. For better or for worse, and  excepting that phase of yours-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. That was  your phase too!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve been through  a lot, over a long time. Real, not ideal, sometimes troubled but  always passionate… compare that to those children and their puppy  love, how are you supposed to justify that? Doesn’t that pervert  the whole system?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you know this  school,” Kaname remarked. “It’s all about appearances. That’s  all that matters. The idea of a destined love, as opposed to  something real, sells well. It doesn’t even have to last, does it?  It just has to last for long enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true enough.  But still, if you’re talking about emotions, then I won’t  compromise. Our bond is greater.” Momomi picked up a pebble and  threw it at the lake. “That’s what I would have said before,  anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname closed her eyes.  “I know. But did I ever tell you the difference between the fakes  and the real thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not in so many words,  no,” Momomi replied irritably. “Though I have some idea of where  you’re going. Something about cracked girls, perhaps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not exactly. But the difference  isn’t in appearances, that’s for sure. It’s very easy for fakes  to appear just like the real thing, and often there isn’t a great  deal of difference between them. How you seem and how people see you  is something that remains very easy to manipulate… more than that,  though, it isn’t anything that requires conscious manipulation.  Simply put, you’ll never tell just by looking at the generalities.  Just like a decent forgery, the distinction is in the detail.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s nice  to know,” Momomi muttered. “Now I’m good enough to almost pass  for that third-year brat and her sickening smirk and her warbling  voice and her diffuse attitude-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, don’t get  agitated.” Kaname stood, brushing herself off and taking a step  towards the lake. “It’s not really a matter of personality,  either, or rather the general thrust of your personality isn’t all  that important. To all intents and purposes, if it works at all it  will probably work well enough to begin with, and certainly people  aren’t too picky about personality. Even when someone’s  personality flaws are deep and blatant, their antisocial tendencies  wide open for all to see and their disinterest in everyone around  them clear, that will be ignored if they have enough of an  indeterminate something. It’s not anything that can be described.  But if you have it, anything will be forgiven. Even if you aspire to  the title of Etoile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so? Well,  aren’t we lucky…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, how should I put  this?” Kaname closed her eyes. “The difference between a fake and  the real thing isn’t anything that can be observed in a single  moment. A single moment can, perhaps, be perfect, but that’s  meaningless in an ever-moving world. Appearance, personality and  attitude, whether real or projected, aren’t differentiated in a  single moment. That’s just a dead still-portrait, a pretty picture  that has nothing to do with the real world. Even if it’s a moving  picture, a string of pictures, a film, if you will… that’s just a  neat excerpt, edited and framed by the time spent on it, the result  is completely fake. It’s like a fairytale, framed between a  beginning and a happy ending. Real life is contiguous. That’s why  you can only distinguish the real thing from what others can affect  over a great span of time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it’s our fault,  then? Because we could never compete with Amane, as she’s the real  thing? Is that what you’re saying?” Momomi scowled irritably.  “Your worship of her really does know no limits. But I don’t  understand it at all. Why are you claiming that fundamental  difference now? You always said you were as good as her! You were  always as proud as her! So what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re noisy. I  never said anything about that.” Kaname looked over her shoulder.  “Let me finish. The difference between the real and the fake is  time. The fakes can look perfect for a while but they won’t last.  The real thing doesn’t even have to look perfect, because it’s  far stronger at heart… it’s not about appearances or personality  or anything like that. It is, unto itself, an end to itself, forever  consistent. A fake is a happy summer romance, a fairy-tale with a  prince and a princess.” She walked towards the lake. “The real  thing is sadness and stupidity, an endless parade of mistakes that is  completely ugly… but for all that, and forever, it remains. I’ll  remain here with you, and you won’t abandon me. That’s what  reality is.” She stopped, glaring at her reflection. “As ever,  reality fucking sucks. But it’s not like it ever pretended to be  kind. It’s something everyone has to deal with in the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that complex of  yours won’t disappear so easily after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sure enjoying  having it both ways, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s fine.”  Momomi shook her head. “It suits me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Kaname  looked away again. “Well, it’s not like I’ve ever pretended to  be an honest and sincere person, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you  pretended, you wouldn’t fool me for a moment anyway.” Momomi fell  back, looking at the sky. “But, when you say with such assurance  that I’ll stay, that doesn’t exactly make me satisfied.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess trust is well  past its sell-by date in this relationship. But that’s fine. If you  can’t quit, it’s as good as if you won’t, and even if you have  niggling resentments I’d rather you were here slashing me to  ribbons with them than elsewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re a surprising  sado-masochist, aren’t you. You always talk in such violent ways,  after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m a violent  person. But you’re a cruel person, so either way it works well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And is Amane a cruel  person?” Momomi asked sarcastically. “Or is it the fact that  she’s kind something that appeals strangely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. She is a cruel  person, in her own way. But you know that already. In any case, from  now on, I could care less about Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s nice to  know. It’d be even nicer if I could believe you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not still  going on about that, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know you very well,  Kaname. And if you’ve become very accustomed to me, you’ve also  become very accustomed to Amane.” Momomi held her hand up at arm’s  length, frowning thoughtfully. “Always, always, you hate her and  watch her, compete with her and acknowledge her, think about her and  obsess over her… this isn’t anything like the first time when I  wondered who is more important to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re right,  of course. Amane is my most important rival, and I’ve spent years  trying to beat her. My consistent failure is frustrating enough. And  you’re right, too, in that there were certainly times where she was  the most important person I was worrying about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi let her hand fall  back, turning her head and looking at the trees. “I thought so.  Well, it was obvious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Anyone  would be like that.” Kaname snorted. “Whoever heard of anyone who  castles when their Queen is in the enemy lines?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?” Momomi closed  her eyes. “Okay, you won’t get me twice. If I’m a person you  can count on, then you shouldn’t spend time on me. You should waste  all your energy on the other person you recognise in this school…  perhaps the only other person you acknowledge here at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. You know,  don’t you? That’s the kind of thinking you use when you intend to  live an uncompromising life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or alternately, it’s  just a cool way of saying that you’ve been taking me for granted.  Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I’ve been  taking you for granted. But if you hadn’t noticed, I just said that  I’m through with Amane. If you don’t believe me, I can’t help  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can say that all  you please, but you’ve said all you need to say anyway.” Momomi  folded her hands behind her head. “Because you can’t count on me  anymore, you’re concentrating on me. You’ll live me attention,  energy and dare I even say love. But that’s just castling when the  enemy queen is in your lines. Once you’ve fixed things between us,  you’ll go running after Amane again. In short, you live in a  selfish way, following your interests.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you let me get  away with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I let you get  away with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s a very  elegant simplification as well, isn’t it? The fact that I wanted to  beat Amane is undeniable, but who is the one who wanted to become  Etoile?” Kaname knelt, grabbing a pebble, and threw it at the lake.  It skipped twice before sinking without trace. “That would be you.  In that respect, you turned a lot of your own energy outwards. You’ve  always been the one to drive me to that, after all. You had your own  obsession, and it’s the end of that obsession as much as my  betrayal that has damaged our relationship. It mattered to you, and I  broke it. That was my mistake, but it’s nor yours to say it didn’t  exist at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?  Certainly, I wanted the title, and it would be wrong for me to deny  that. But it is absolutely wrong for you to pretend that my  ‘obsession’ is the same as yours. Didn’t you notice?” Momomi  snorted. “Well, I never let you notice, because you hate insecure  people. But I’d spent months without the smallest sign of affection  from you. You always had my attention, I always supported you and you  always took the lead with Amane… but with everything else, I always  took the lead. You know what I mean. I woke up one morning and  noticed that my own girlfriend was too busy to have sex with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you seriously  telling me you don’t like to take the lead? That’s how your taste  runs, nothing to do with victimhood. No, I’d believe in that if I  never had the time or if I kept making excuses. As it is, it was just  an easy routine for both of us. That’s what I thought, anyway.”  Kaname stooped again, searching for another pebble. “If you had a  problem, you should have just told me. That shows a lack of trust in  itself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As ever, you’re quick to deflect  blame, even as you feign contrition.” Momomi folded her arms. “And  unusually for you, you’re missing the point. It’s not just about  the sex. You let me, but that was all. You granted me permission. You  never said nice things, or that you loved me, or bothered with  anything superfluous at all… you just did what you had to do. By  the time I noticed that, I didn’t know your feelings at all. I  didn’t even know whether I was a desirable person to you anymore,  and for someone like me to have such doubts… that really is wrong.  So I pushed even harder than before, but that hardly helped at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you know how I  am,” Kaname muttered. “I don’t need to hear these things,  because I know. And you should be the same. I don’t like to say it  over and over; it’s just the way things are, something that won’t  change. I love you. I love your body, and everything you do with it.  You shouldn’t get insecure about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And how was I  supposed to take all that on faith when you said nothing? When you  just sat by and let things happen? When Amane had your full  attention?” Momomi gritted her teeth. “You tell me, Kaname. I’m  smart but I’m not a telepath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if you didn’t  know that perhaps you aren’t so smart after all!” Kaname snapped.  “It’s always been that way, right? And I’ve always been that  way too. This isn’t anything new.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, you’ve always  been that way, alright! It’s something I hate about you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I hate people who  make me say it over and over. So where are we then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very troubled. But  what am I supposed to say, Kaname?” Momomi frowned unhappily. “I’m  just a girl. I need you to say these things. I need you to care. If  you don’t give me that, I don’t have anything to take from this  but sex and emptiness inside…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another pebble plopped  into the water. “Isn’t it enough to just know?” Kaname asked  quietly. “It’s always been that way with you… I knew in my mind  that you cared so much for me, and that feeling alone was enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t make yourself  the victim here. I was the one who had to suffer like this for so, so  long.” Momomi shredded several blades of grass with her free hand,  scattering them to the wind. “How hard would it be? Is your dignity  really that important to you? Because even if it’s you, Kaname, if  your ego is more important than my feelings…” Momomi closed her  eyes again. “I can’t be in that kind of relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If my ego was more  important, I wouldn’t feel like crap right now. But you know that  I’m a proud person.” She sat abruptly, picking through the grass.  “And I know I screwed up on a lot of things. I wish I could say  that I’d make it up to you, but I can’t even count on myself for  that. I’m that kind of person. Someone who takes without giving,  forever. It’s not like I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Self-pity’s  useless. Do something to change, or just go… even if you say I’ll  always be with you, there’s a limit to what I can take. And it’s  been far too long for us to be anything like friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That suits me fine.  I’ll have everything or nothing. I’ve always been that way.”  Kaname picked up another pebble, weighing it in her hands. “So I  will take that chance. I’ll take that chance on myself, and do  whatever it takes… I’ll say it over and over… and I will make  it up to you, after all. I love you and only you, and you are the  only person who truly appeals to me in a world full of miserable  idiots.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And, if it’s any  consolation, I prefer it when you take the lead. To know there’s  someone who I can’t dominate in this world, it’s a wonderful  feeling in a very strange way. But also, I could only allow that from  you. What am I trying to say?” Kaname rubbed the back of her head.  “Well, you get the idea. But from now on , I won’t just rest on  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She threw the pebble. It  skipped six times before sinking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “You  know, I’ve been wondering…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  would <em>they </em>say, if  they were here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They. Everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About anything in  particular, or just generally?” Kaname chuckled. “Don’t answer  that… but I really don’t think they’d be too surprised. They  knew who we were, or else they were even more stupid than I’ve  given them credit for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so. That’s  how it is,” Momomi agreed. “But you know, sometimes I wonder  whether we know each other least of all, and they knew us better…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  just psychology. We always make people think we understand them  better than they do, even if that isn’t the case. It’s a trick of  manner and the mind. All it takes is confidence, and you can make  someone else doubt. And if they think you can see their innermost  soul, that’s all to the good.” Kaname chuckled. “And it’s  even better if you actually <em>can</em>,  and we can. People like little Hikari and her friend, what is her  name… small people like that are far too easy to read.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re an expert at  changing the subject, as usual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You started this  conversation. If you want to go back, you can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. This is fine.”  Momomi chuckled. “That’d be the best hit we landed on those,  wasn’t it? It’s too bad that she’s with her second choice now,  twisting the screws there would have been fun and productive. But  considering she’s more dangerous than Hikari and less lazy than  Amane or Shizuma, this way also works. We can destroy the person who  can destroy us. That’s how it should be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your vicious streak  hasn’t gone away, either. Well, I know who you are too, of course.”  Kaname chuckled. “You’d play mind games with an innocent little  third-year?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only if she tried it  with us. As things stand, we have nothing to gain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true enough.  But still, the art of manner which they used on us, it’s ours now.”  Kaname frowned. “Though I can’t say I’m confident that I kept  my promise now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi raised her  eyebrows. “Your promise?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even then, I told you  that we’d outshine them. Kariya and Serané.” Kaname paused  for a moment, looking down at the lake. “Looks like we fell just  short of the goal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. “You  think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what can I  say?” Kaname turned and looked down at her, smiling wanly. “I  make a terrible Kariya. Though you do shine brighter than Serané,  but it’s a dark light you cast, too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do know there’s  no such thing as a dark light, right?” Momomi sat up. “But it is  a light I cast, all the same. Even if I’m not called Etoile. There  was a lot more to those two than their title. No, the title was the  least important thing. Serané and Kariya would be Serané  and Kariya regardless. And even now, impossibly enough, I have a  little faith in Kaname… though that’s because I’m stupid. But  it can’t be helped, can it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re saying this  now? You know, my life would have been a lot easier if you’d  reached this epiphany earlier than now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’ve had a  long time to think. And it looks like I’m a little further than  you, because you haven’t noticed the truth yourself. You gave me  unending trouble because you had to beat Amane. But you’ll be  yourself, regardless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s very cute.  But I’m at my most outstanding when I’m fighting her. Oh, and I  make my most monumental fuck-ups, as well. All the same, you know I  won’t ever believe in being happy just to be myself. That’s just  too lame. If I was satisfied with that, I’d be a very long way from  here. Probably on drugs and even more over-sexed than I am now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think the  latter is possible. But aside from that, I won’t stop aspiring  either. That’s who I am. And for as long as you chase after Amane,  I’m entitled to that.” Momomi scratched her nose. “But it’s  not like we ever put much stock by public opinion. This is fine as  well, for now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad,” Kaname  admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The truth is that the  title Etoile can have so much or so little meaning, depending on the  person… but there’s plenty of options without the title, all the  same. I have a few in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that time. Now  you’re planning again, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Was I  likely to be beaten by this forever? Not even you matter to me that  much, Kaname. I’m stronger than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Yeah, you have  your stern face on. Is this the same girl that was so whiny just  now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least I wasn’t  apologising in such a craven way,” Momomi retorted. “Now, come  on. If you think you’ve broken your promise just with this, then  you’re a useless idiot and you can leave now. I’ve come a long  way from who I was then, and I’ll go further.” She raised her  hand. “So, hurry up, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled, taking  her hand and pulling the girl up. “Does this mean I’m forgiven?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not for ten thousand  years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… then I won’t  ask for your forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who needs it, anyway?  You can just remember this forever, as I will.” Momomi brushed  herself off. “If I’m going to be stuck here anyway, it’s  irrelevant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “So  what’s the plan, commander?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Plan? I haven’t had  that long to think, you know. I’m still worrying about my certain  most troublesome, saddening person.” Momomi stuck her hands in her  pockets. “But the first step is obvious. You’re going to be  Spica’s Student Council President. That much is natural. Not even  Shion can keep that from us. If she moved, we would, and Spica would  implode. That’s how things are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Amane, Hikari and  friends? All three of them, that is…” Kaname shrugged. “The  Etoile could keep that from us easily enough. However I look at it,  we continue to exist with our reputations intact on their  forbearance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As I noted before, we  can pressurise that Nanto girl fairly effectively. Hikari is  essentially passive, despite it all… no, despite it all, she’s  trying to reach us. Which is ridiculous, but she is a ridiculous  girl. I think we can play on that, actually. We weren’t on the ball  earlier, but if we go to her with enough contrition that should be  enough to leverage an opening. If you compare Hikari to Amane,  they’re not on the same level, at anything. Hikari is Amane’s  weakness, a unique one, and one she’s never had before. As we said  before, Hikari is a chance. But we’ll play smarter than we did  before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “And is  Amane going to let us do as much? Even if she didn’t move against  us before, she won’t be fooled by any of our acts, and she’ll  definitely try to keep Hikari away from us. If she was the one who  moved against our nomination… she doesn’t even have to mention  that. She just has to say she thinks we’re a bad choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane is not a  confrontational person. If it came to that, we’d be forced to  yield, but I don’t think she’ll let it come to that. And even if  she did, we can let it be known that we wouldn’t go down quietly.  We still have strong support from the younger years as well, and  while Amane is a good idol she is not a good friend. From now on,  you’ll be leading the kendo club again, and I’ll return to the  literature club. Further, when the new year truly begins along with  the arrival of the new first years, we can work on them.” Momomi’s  eyes were closed now, her lips compressed in a kind of concentration.  “No, this is another chance. If I know Amane, she will fulfil her  duties to the letter, unlike Shizuma… but she doesn’t possess any  drive to go further. Whatever you say of Shizuma, her habit of  sexually harassing the lower years made her strangely popular. She  noticed them. But Amane is the most diffuse person I’ve ever met.  That hasn’t changed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rubbed her  forehead. “You’re scaring me again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. I told you,  didn’t I? Even if I’m upset, I can still think. On that note, a  lover’s reconciliation is a touching story. It’s a pity we were  completely upstaged by Shizuma, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That woman… she  always had a flair for the dramatic, but that was so theatrical as to  be one of your more audacious stunts. Who does she think she is? A  character from one of those crappy romances with the runaway brides?”  Kaname snorted. “Incidentally, I’m not what you might call a  traditionally-minded person, but those kind of stories annoy me.  Abandoning your groom on the altar is what I’d call… critical  failure of mental clarity, really. And men who treat women that way  get a less gentle treatment, of course, but it’s not enough. What  kind of idiot doesn’t realise their own emotions until then? And  how are you supposed to trust someone who abandoned a marriage on the  day for you anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a little  off-topic, Kaname,” Momomi chided.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s on topic. Like  I said, Shizuma did that… and that Aoi girl is that kind of person.  Well, it’s irrelevant insofar as Shizuma won’t matter any more,  and someone as weak as Aoi isn’t anything to worry about either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And of course  Shizuma’s little stunt rather upstaged Amane’s election, as well.  That can’t be bad for us. They’re settling in well enough, but  only time will tell whether they really have the ability to support  the role. That, and the strength of emotion to keep up their  relationship…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you going to  suggest sabotaging them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not. That was your plan. It sucked, to say the least. Those  two can do what they like all on their own.” Momomi frowned  thoughtfully. “Though, for all I dismiss Hikari, she does have a  certain fundamental… what’s the word? Niceness. She’s <em>nice.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So are digestive  biscuits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite. But  unlike Amane, Hikari actually likes people. So she might gain some  friends, as she’d put it, amongst the lower years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That shy girl?”  Kaname asked cynically. “I can say with one hundred percent  confidence that she’s one of nature’s victims. She managed to say  one good thing, but that’s as far as she goes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Well,  considering the light that reflects off Amane, she may exponentially  grow in confidence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s the case,  we can shoot her down.” Kaname caught Momomi’s glare. “Subtly.  But what’s the goal, anyway? This is a long way to go for something  as lame and difficult as Student Council President… and it’s so  obviously the consolation prize. Look at them. Rokujou who wanted to  be with Shizuma and Shion who wanted to be with Amane. It’s what  you might call an admission of defeat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “Well,  that’s true enough. But didn’t you notice, in that election?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t so much a  contest between Spica and Miator as it was a contest between Miyuki  and Shion. Both of them handpicked and worked hard with their  prospective candidates. Aoi and Suzumi wouldn’t have run without  Miyuki. Of course, that goes a thousand times over for Amane in  particular and Hikari as well… though Shizuma’s interference was  pretty fatal, it’s still Shion’s victory. Even now, I think our  senpai has something left to teach us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  closed her eyes. “So you want that role? The term would be<em>kingmaker</em>, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s such an  aggressive term. It’s nothing so dramatic. But it’s natural that  the Student Council President, the greatest advocate a school has,  should guide selection of the new Etoile candidates. Besides, you’ll  be the Student Council President. You have a stronger reputation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you’ll plan  this stuff. That makes you the power behind the power behind the  throne, at least for a little while…” Kaname laughed. “You’ll  hate me for saying this, but that role suits you far better than the  title ‘Etoile’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right, I  think. Kingmaker, you say? It has a nice ring to it.” Momomi  smiled. “Perhaps we’ll call ourselves that after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that’s where we  go from here, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More or less. I still  need to iron out the details, and there are bound to be other  dimensions… I need to find our candidates, too, but-” Momomi  stopped abruptly, glancing at Kaname’s face. “What’s with that  serious look? You’d better not have gotten soft on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, nothing like  that. I’m just…” Kaname stepped forwards, glancing at her with  serious eyes. “Welcome back… Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you really think  I’d go anywhere?” Momomi asked quietly. “You said it yourself,  I wouldn’t just leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.” Kaname  threw her arms around Momomi, glaring over the girl’s shoulder.  “Just because I can say something, that doesn’t mean I can  believe it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.” Momomi’s  face relaxed and she hugged Kaname in return. “And you call me the  insecure, whiny one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said, welcome  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi closed her eyes.  “I’m home.”</span></p>
