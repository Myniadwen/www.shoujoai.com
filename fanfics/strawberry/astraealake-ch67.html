<p>“So, a play?  Amane-san is actually taking part in a play?” Yuho leaned forwards over  her chair, looking interested. “Is that true, Kenjou? You’re also  involved, aren’t you?” </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s true. But it’s got nothing to do with me. Go talk to Amane yourself, if it interests you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  matter how many times you say that, Kenjou, it’s easier to talk to you.  Plus you’re fairly funny when you’re annoyed.” Yuho shifted her head  sideways, smirking. “Besides, it’s rare for Amane-san to talk to  anyone. That’s why her relationship with Kiyashiki is such an  interesting thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She talks to Olesa as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so… well, she’s not here. You’re closer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  groaned. “Isn’t it more like the fact that her part is old whereas  Momomi’s is novel? You people have short attention spans.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  weird when you talk about it is as if you’re not involved.” Yuho  flicked a finger against the table. “But still, Amane-san in a play  will definitely be interesting. I thought it was just a waste of time,  but if even she’s involved, it must be good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “That doesn’t make any sense, but whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what’s the play? Twelfth Night, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? So you can read posters now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, thank you, Kenjou. Who is Amane-san playing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Viola. Though I doubt that means anything to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not, so tell me who Viola is, dumbass? The main character?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  girl who spends most of the play dressed as a guy. So obviously Amane’s  really well suited for that part.” Kaname folded her arms. “And one of  two twins. I’m playing the other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds weird. Well, I can’t wait to see her acting. She’ll probably be really amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Save  that for when you actually know anything about her acting. If you just  say it because you’re a fangirl, it’s far too stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, they say she was amazing at the audition,” Yuho retorted. “You were there too, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yeah. She was decent.” Kaname shrugged. “That’s no reason to treat her  like a God of thespianism, though. She’s not a specialist, just a  talented amateur, and she’s no more than decent either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. That’s not what I heard. I bet you’re just jealous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who’d be jealous of her?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you would. Very visibly, before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever.  That was a long time ago, and if you don’t think I’ve changed you’re  stupid. I don’t see why I should be threatened by someone who doesn’t  even have a social life to speak of.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so. You’re still competitive about her, though, aren’t you? Always downplaying her achievements.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean I have a sense of perspective where you girls hype everything she does?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  that’s the case, you’re someone with a sense of perspective in a  minority of one. That doesn’t seem so likely to me, anyway.” Yuho  looked at her, eyes amused. “In any case, I was never sure why you  bothered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho shrugged. “It’s obvious, isn’t it?  With you and Amane-san… of course you always lost. Competing with her  is a pointless exercise. She’s a genius, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that just the laziness of someone who can’t be bothered to compete?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you haven’t really challenged her for a while, either. Why? Because it’d be pointless, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Even if it suits you to think she’s invincible, she’s not true. She can be beaten.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,  but not by me and you, right? Compared to us, Amane is something  completely different.” Yuho’s eyes met Kaname’s. “Don’t you agree?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Different? In the sense that she has no friends, yes. But that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho shrugged, raising her hands. “There’s no helping you, is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted, turning away. “As if I want to be helped…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, how are things with you and Kiyashiki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  an obvious question, isn’t it?” Yuho sat up. “I’m surprised you managed  to get a girlfriend like her, but I suppose it’s because you are  roommates. It gives you a head-start, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. Things are fine. That’s all, isn’t it?” Kaname replied, frowning. <em>It’s strange, though. Not so long ago, Momomi was what Yuho called a strange girl. Is she cool now? People are way too fickle.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  all? You’re so boring to talk to.” Yuho leaned forwards. “So, how far  have you got with her? First base or second, or what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stared at her for a few seconds. “You’re nuts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess I shouldn’t expect too much from you, after all… but never mind.  I’ve heard you do some nice things with her, though. Kenjou the  romantic. I never thought I’d see the day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you don’t know anything about me, so you don’t even have the right to be surprised.” Kaname looked around impatiently. <em>So where’s that blasted teacher? </em>“We’re a normal couple, nothing exciting. What did you expect?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing, in particular. I’m just wondering. Of course, I still have know idea why she picked you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I stood by her while the rest of you saw her as a weird new girl to be  avoided if possible. Perhaps you’d forgotten that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho blinked. “Oh? Have I touched a nerve?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow I don’t think you’re going to apologise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. But it’s still curious. Considering Amane-san’s apparent interest, why did she pick you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  the same reply,” Kaname retorted. “Because I was doing a thousand  things for Momomi while Amane sat on her ass and thought of horses  without even knowing her name. That’s why. I’ll take a lot of crap from  you, but that comparison doesn’t even make sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The advantage  of a roommate, I suppose, like I said before.” Yuho smiled. “But at  least you have some pride when you talk about it. Hmm… I wonder,  actually. Is this why you’re fixating on Amane-san again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not the one obsessing with her here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I had a girlfriend spending a lot of time with Amane-san, I know I’d be worried.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’d be a wasted worry. She’s dead from the waist down, or possibly, you know, straight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder… but whatever. It’s your problem, not mine, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  opened her mouth and was about to reply irritably when the teacher  finally arrived. She leaned back, folding her arms tightly and closing  her eyes. <em>Annoying girl…she’s always talking about stupid things. I  guess she’s a perfect representation of most people in this school,  which is a pretty damning indictment of the people in this school. If  it isn’t about how awesome Amane is it’s banal gossip about  relationships. How pathetic can you get? I’ll give Shion credit; at  least she’s professional, systematic and efficient. Making up theories  for the sake of it and engaging in random speculation based on  half-baked rumours is completely pointless, though. And so bloody  changeable! Momomi’s just a case in point. It hasn’t taken long for  Amane’s obscure magic to rub off on her. At this rate, our entire group  will be promoted from a bunch of losers to the new cool kids, all  because of our association with Amane. That’s just beyond ridiculous. </em>Kaname leaned forwards as the teacher began, resting her head on her hands and pretending to pay a semblance of attention. <em>And  it would be seriously annoying, as well. If people like Yuho and her  friends disturbed our mornings talking to us I doubt I could be able to  stand it. The friendships where, if nothing else, we can be who we are  and talk about the weird things that are exclusively ours would be  totally destroyed. Instead, I suppose, we’d make polite, empty  conversation. Something befitting Amane, a series of friendships  without friends, with no individuality and personality. I can’t take  that kind of crap.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But… but. There’s also a problem. What  Momomi wants to do now and what I often what to do will also result in  that kind of thing. It’s something that comes with that dubious  blessing popularity. </em>Kaname sighed, looking down at the desk. <em>It’s  hardly a new issue. Fame or the localised equivalent is nice for the  most part, but it’s not all good. For someone like me, the bad presses  down pretty heavily. I can’t just do what I would normally do without a  thought like Serané or someone, I’m not that kind of person. And I do  enjoy being peaceful and undisturbed by most people. It’s Momomi’s  aspiration, though, to be popular, the good and the bad alike. She’s  smart enough to know what that means. And I said it myself, that I’d  support her aspirations provided she helped me with my own. I meant  that. I want people to recognise me, acknowledge me, and respect me.  Even if I try to pretend I don’t need anyone, that is true, and Momomi  instinctively understood that. No, I think she knows that I need  acknowledgement more than a lot of people in this school, and that’s  why I struggle so hard to hide it. My mother never recognised me and  very few people had kind things to say about me. That’s why Momomi, who  says I’m important, is also important to me. And that’s why I’d like to  surpass the Etoiles and become a magnificent person. But when people  can see you they can judge you. Negative judgements hurt as well, and  I’m as self-conscious as I am praise vain. It’s an unpleasant  contradiction. But I’ve decided. I am going to go all out, for Momomi  as well. I just have to hope that things turn out alright for us both.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Amane,  too. Because my aspiration is to beat her, still, for so many reasons,  whatever I might say to Yuho. Why? Since when? If I’m truly pressed,  even I’m not sure, though I have a lot of things to say about Amane.  She’s someone I waste a lot of time thinking about. Well, I’m doing the  same thing now, aren’t I? That’s not even funny, damn her. But still,  her bloody acting and this bloody play are both very annoying right  now. I couldn’t believe it when she acted like that at the audition.  It’s extremely frustrating. </em>Kaname sighed thoughtfully. <em>But at  the same time, I’m almost glad, which is just perverse. It’s got to the  point where she’s proved so hard to beat at everything that I never  want her to be easy. This way is worthy of her, or somesuch. Though I’d  never say that to anyone, not even Momomi. It sounds far too stupid.  Well, Momomi would just smirk at me, which wouldn’t be so bad. But it’s  still a painful thing to admit. Her performance, ultimately, doesn’t  change anything. I only want to beat her all the more because of it.  There’s plenty of time left in this play, after all. I’ve committed  myself, though, to those two goals. To become popular and to beat  Amane, which are both tied to this play. It’s time I get serious about  them, about everything. I will definitely succeed, however I much I  have to struggle. I’ll do it for Momomi, and also for myself. </em>Kaname tapped a finger against the desk. <em>But  how far do I go? How popular is popular enough? Is it enough to beat  Amane at any one thing, or do I have to be consistent? And am I fine  with things as they are? However I look at it, my melancholy loneliness  watching those two together hasn’t gone away. I don’t know whether I  should fight that or not. I don’t know a lot of things. Momomi, for the  most part, makes everything more complicated.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Friendship.  Popularity. Competition. Our aspirations. The comfortable present and  the desired future. Our relationship, too, our commitment and the pace  we should move at. All these things differ between the two of us, and  they’re all things we need to discuss. </em>Kaname scowled, slumping forwards and resting her chin on the desk. <em>However  I look at it, some things will probably always stay the same. We’ll  always have our own worries and insecurities. But, in a way, that’s  reassuring. Only a love-drunk idiot thinks they’re in a “perfect”  relationship. It’s better to see the problems for what they are now,  and then talk about them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The lesson dragged out for far too  long, Kaname’s attention drifting and wavering between a dozen  different subjects. She just wanted it to end, so she could finally go  to lunch and see Momomi again. But that was also something she was  wondering about, especially when the bell finally went and she was  free. They met, talked, brought their lunches and retreated to the  comforts of their own room. They weren’t doing anything special. It was  just routine. It was strange to enjoy routine so much. But that wasn’t  something she could say out loud.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi, predictably, kissed her  full on the lips the moment the door closed. Kaname placed a hand on  her shoulder, not quite pulling her in and not quite pushing her away,  either. “Honestly. You’re really impatient, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t tell me you don’t enjoy that,” Momomi replied, smiling flirtatiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  flicked her on the nose, smiling. “Don’t get too full of yourself.” She  picked up a pair of books on History, then went and sat on her bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat next to her, notebook balanced on her knees. “Alone at last, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We have work to do, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  still far too professional. It’s annoying.” Momomi put her arm around  Kaname’s shoulders, leaning forwards and staring at the history books  she was holding. “So? What period are we studying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The 1905 Russo-Japanese war,” Kaname replied neutrally.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not romantic at all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, not a lot of History is romantic, when you get down to it. What do you expect?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know. You’re right, I suppose. History isn’t a fertile ground.”  Momomi clicked her fingers. “How about the middle ages? Knights are  quite romantic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean the knights who used chastity belts on  their wives then went to fight in the Crusades, often adulterating with  local prostitutes while they were at it?” Kaname asked. “Not to mention  the rape and pillage, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still too literal.  Remember what I told you before, pretty lies are good!” Momomi smirked.  “It’s not like I don’t know this stuff, right? I’m willing to suspend  my disbelief, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname kissed her on the cheek, smirking. “Isn’t that a lot easier?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Romance is still important. Verbal foreplay, too. You should be less impatient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me being impatient? Yeah, like that makes sense-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  was cut off when Momomi kissed her again. “Actually, I take your  point,” the brown-haired girl replied, eyes bright. “You do talk too  much from time to time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was  talking to Yuho earlier,” Kaname remarked. “And you appear to have gone  up in her estimation. Now she’s asking me why you’re with me rather  than calling you a weird person unworthy of Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? I’m flattered… I think.” Momomi shrugged. “She sounds like a strange girl, from what I’ve heard of her, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s an understatement, but still, she’s a good and confident example  of a certain type of person.” Kaname sighed. “A type of person we get a  lot around here…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everywhere, probably. We’re the strange ones, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite. It’s annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  when I think about it, you go on about Amane-san a lot as well. And  didn’t you say something similar about how she should be an untouchable  person for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up. Are you any different, talking to her and about her so much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little different, is what I hope,” Momomi replied amicably. “But I’m  not sure. Perhaps we’re less different from other people than we’d like  to think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “It doesn’t matter. In any case, this is probably good for you, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I suppose so, yes. It shows that people can get used to anything, if  they’re given long enough.” Momomi smirked. “And that something which  is a big deal one day becomes a small one the next. That’s the problem,  of course. If you want to continue to be known, you have to do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Kaname asked, frowning. “It’s not like Amane works at this stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-san  is pretty exceptional, isn’t she?” Momomi teased. “That’s mostly  because of who she, I suppose. The fact that she’s so very mysterious,  and the way she never get involved in anything but riding her horses,  which she’s very good at… if you don’t partake of activities where you  might lose, you’ll gain a reputation as an unbeatable person. We said  that before, right? And if you don’t involve yourself much, it makes  things even more interesting when you do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See? You think about her way too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?” Momomi rubbed her head against Kaname’s shoulder coyly. “Jealous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little. Hardly the point, though. I think I know what you mean. Even if  it isn’t for those reasons, she doesn’t work at this. That’s why if you  become popular, you’ll stay that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-san’s a special  case, though. Not just anyone can do that, right?” Momomi glanced at  her face. “For someone like me, I’ll have to take Shion’s approach. She  gets involved in a lot of things, talks to people and maintains a small  core of… well, fans, I suppose. She pays attention to them, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a more sincere kind of fame, don’t you think?” Kaname muttered. “A lot better than Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s strange for you to praise Shion. But if it’s drawing a comparison  with her, I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.” Momomi raised her head,  nodding. “But I do take your point, as well. That’s why this play is a  good thing, too. She’ll be using her talents for something, this time  around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true enough,” Kaname admitted. “It’s damned inconvenient for me, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you don’t have to make it a competition between you two if you don’t  want to. Shion’s right. A play is principally something people work on  together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Teaming up with Amane? Are you kidding me?” Kaname  smirked. “I don’t think so. Get back to me when the world’s in mortal  danger. Even then, only maybe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose not. But still, you  know you don’t have to compare yourself to her all the time. If it’s  annoying for you, then stop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know I can stop. But this is my choice. I don’t back down from a challenge, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flicked her playfully on the forehead. “You’re one hell of a thick-skulled girl, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you say so. I prefer the term tenacious, myself.” Kaname chuckled  suddenly. “Actually, that’s funny, isn’t it? There aren’t many  qualities in this world which can’t be inverted by using a different  word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think so?” Momomi asked. “Well, let’s see… unfaithful?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Free spirited.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bigoted?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… that depends on the context. But ‘moral’ appears to work nine times out of ten.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Simple-minded? Down-to-earth? Personally, though, I’d make a case for innocent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Violent?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Strong or protective. Something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded, frowning. “Hmm… in denial?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s another tricky one.” Kaname scowled, tapping a finger idly. “It depends on context, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dishonest, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That depends on the context as well. There are plenty of cases where people would agree that a lie was moral.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a bit of an evasion, Kaname…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so. Well, you are right, those two are harder to twist.” Kaname  closed her eyes for a moment, smiling. “I think that’s quite telling,  actually. People have a morbid fascination with the truth as some  important thing. If you say that you possess a truth that will make  their life a misery, they’ll still want to hear it nine times out of  ten. People are obsessed with it. So, whether it’s to yourself or to  others, altering facts is considered very dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  true, isn’t it? I think it’s an evolutionary thing. People need to know  things to make the best decision for their own interests. If others  manipulate the information they receive, it’s possible to control  them.” Momomi back, smiling. “And every person believes deep in their  hearts that they and they alone are best qualified to judge on  anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Pretty stupid, really. Truth or lies, it doesn’t matter as long as you are fed, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  even if you say that, you’d hate it if I hid the truth from you about  anything important. Regardless of whether or not it was for your own  good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s also true.” Kaname shrugged. “What can I say? I’m only human.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  something that relates to trust. That’s an important concept for people  as well. I’m sure this all relates back to tribal structures, somehow.”  Momomi leaned on Kaname’s shoulder again, smiling thoughtfully. “How do  I know that I can trust you? You betrayed my trust! I’ll never be able  to trust you again! Stuff like that is big in relationships, isn’t it?  I mean, objectively monogamy is bizarre. When your association with a  person passes a critical point, you can’t be at that level with anyone  else… it’s a strange concept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does that mean I can cheat on you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope. I’d kill you.” Momomi giggled. “I’m only human, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I know what you mean. Truth, trust and fidelity… they’re not exactly  concepts animals need, but we worry so much about them. Animals only  need to worry about when they get food or get laid.” Kaname frowned.  “So does that mean we’re more advanced? Or does that means we’ve  regressed in a strange way, having so much more to fret about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think the fact that we can afford to worry about such things proves our  dominance. We don’t have tigers to spear any more, so this is the stuff  we expend our energy on instead.” Momomi grinned. “But in any case,  self-knowledge and truthfulness are important to people everywhere… so  I’m sure we’d be hated if people knew who we really are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right, I suppose. It’s an interesting thought.” Kaname glanced at her. “No need to tell them, though, is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.  But is that kind of lie a white one or not? If it’s the only way to  avoid us being hated… that’s something to think about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think  that’s a false choice. We could become honest, God-fearing reformed  characters if we really wanted to, we just can’t be bothered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  right. And in any case, the distinction between kinds of lies are  dubious at best. As far as I’m concerned, I can be liberal with the  truth as much as I like, unless it’s with you. Perhaps Olesa too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m flattered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With you two, I’m merely partly liberal with the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great.” Kaname laughed. “You really haven’t changed at all, have you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? You think I had changed?” Momomi smirked. “You don’t know me very well. There wasn’t anything to lie about, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m a little better about admitting my own feelings, if you ask me,”  Kaname retorted. “I’ve changed, even if you haven’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So when  you won’t say romantic things, that’s because you have no romantic  feelings for me?” Momomi pouted, looking sad. “That’s just too cruel,  Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname flushed. “I- well, that’s to say… I mean- oh,  shut up.” She turned away, looking furious. “You don’t really think  that, so it’s no problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing’s changed.” Momomi kissed her on the cheek. “And you still blush far too easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah.” Kaname sighed. “In any case, what were we saying before… Amane.  I’m going to carry on, so don’t worry about it. I’ll always compare  myself to her. I’m expecting you to back me up, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you  say so. But why are you so insistent about this?” Momomi smiled,  touching Kaname’s cheek. “You don’t need to beat Amane to be a special  person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, if I’m to impress anyone but my girlfriend something has to change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you saying I’m easy to please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  But if I couldn’t even please you, I would be useless.” Kaname sighed,  looking at the wall. “The truth is that I struggle, trying to follow  people like you and her. Competition makes it easier, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.  Taking things too seriously again…” Momomi rolled over, resting her  legs on Kaname’s bed. “You don’t have to force yourself for anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t <em>have </em>to  breathe, either, but it’s generally a good idea,” Kaname retorted.  “With Yuho, it was simply confirmation of something I’ve already  noticed. You are moving forwards. So I’m not going to be left behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  slid sideways, resting her head on Kaname’s lap. “You won’t be left  behind,” she replied, looking up with vivid brown eyes. “I’m not going  anywhere.” Brown hair spilled about her like a tousled eagle’s halo.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot,” Kaname muttered, looking down at her. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re a good pillow. Simple enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed. “I feel mightily abused. But you should remember, I have my  pride as well. I’d never be able to stand being second to anyone.  That’s why I have to keep up with you. If I didn’t, I’m sure I’d tear  this apart.” She touched Momomi’s cheek gently. “No matter how much I  enjoy it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. I’m the same. But you don’t have to worry.  You’re doing fine, aren’t you?” Momomi smiled. “Look at me. I’m the one  you have to keep up with, I’m the one you have to stand beside. Not  Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. Even if what I’m doing is the same as what I did  before, it’s for a different reason now.” Kaname smiled back. “And that  makes all the difference in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded, closing  her eyes. “The same for me, I suppose. This is probably what Luigia  would expect me to do, but not for the reasons she’d expect. Not for  reasons she’d approve of either. I’m not becoming popular just for the  sake of it, after all.” Her eyes flickered open and she gazed at Kaname  again. “There are things I want to do which require being like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reasons?  That’s another strange, human concept. Objectively, only actions matter  to the world, but we always look at people’s reasons. That’s what makes  you human. Even if it’s something simple and stupid, everyone has a  reason for what they do. For instance, the reason you’re doing this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Because it’s fun and comfortable. That’s enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course.” Kaname ran her thumb over the skin beneath Momomi’s chin.  “That’s true enough. But in this position, it would be relatively easy  for me to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “You have quite the way of making me feel secure, you know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  why things like this feel good. If you lower your defences, you can be  hurt, but it’s also a show of trust and a means of understanding.”  Kaname touched Momomi’s ear gently. “Physically and mentally, that’s  what a relationship is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, from time to time you are surprisingly romantic. You’re all mushy at heart, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really… I’m just normal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… oh, well.” Momomi chuckled. “Let’s leave it at that, before you take it back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  were silent for a while, merely enjoying each other’s company. Kaname  gently explored Momomi’s face, neck, hair, quietly amazed that she’d  let her do so, lying there so gently and so contentedly with her hands  in her lap. It was strange. Almost ridiculous. But she wasn’t going to  fight it. “Your hair… it’s very beautiful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that a compliment from you? That’s still a very unexpected and precious thing, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname pinched Momomi’s cheek playfully. “You impudent girl. Can’t I say anything without you being sarcastic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. It’s just what I do.” Momomi smiled back at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s hauntingly beautiful… I’m sure I could lose myself in those eyes, even if it’s a cliché. </em>“It’s  just what you do far too much,” Kaname quipped. “No wonder I never say  nice things about you, though, if this is how you treat me when I take  you at your word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sure are stubborn most of the time, and  oversensitive when it’s convenient for you,” Momomi teased. “Aren’t  your feelings very useful to have?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If I ended up like that,  it would be far too stupid. So I have to keep saying something,  anything, so I don’t notice her scent and her smile and her warmth and  the look in her eyes. </em>“Of course. Almost as much as your words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I try. I’m glad you’ve noticed. It’s my art, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>For her, too? Does she feel something similar? Is that why she says the same empty things? It’s weird to think about. </em>“I prefer your writing. Even if I hate the archaic wording.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, don’t be boring. I know you love it really. It makes you feel important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so,” Kaname replied, giving up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shifted her head slightly. “You know, I’ve been thinking about what you  said earlier. Isn’t it more true of positive qualities?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it? I wonder…” Kaname shrugged. “I guess we’ll see. Happiness?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ditziness?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little, I guess. But nor really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s more of an emotion, to be fair. Emotions don’t come with the same connotations as positive or negative things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. Optimism.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naivety.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Creative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Impractical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Imaginative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Easily distracted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… it’s hard to argue with that one.” Momomi giggled. “I suppose that’s one of the very important things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Handsome or beautiful, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As qualities unto themselves, they’re always good too, I guess. You can say stuff like pretty-boy, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rich?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Impractical, again. Everything you’d say about me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smiled. “Well, quite. That doesn’t make it good to be poor, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I suppose the experiment doesn’t work so well after all. However you  look at it, there are some things that people regard as good, all the  time.” Momomi looked thoughtfully at Kaname. “Is that annoying or  encouraging about people in general?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. I’m not finished yet.” Kaname looked down, smirking. “Big breasts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Always a positive, within reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some people would disagree with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some  people have no taste, is all I can say.” Momomi pouted. “But that’s no  reason to say nasty things to make a growing girl insecure! You should  let her flower into a beautiful woman in her own time!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes. Well, there’s no rush,” Kaname teased. “Take as long as you like, it’s fine. It isn’t important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “When you say that, though, it doesn’t exactly make me happy. I think I’m being mocked somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Kaname brushed the hair away from Momomi’s forehead. “One more, then. An emotion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shoot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s easy, isn’t it? Lust.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true… well, how about things associated with that?” Kaname glanced at her. “Trust, for example.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naivety, again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Interdependence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Over-reliance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Love at first sight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, apart from the ever-present other l-word, changeable and fickle affections.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A budding crush, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think the term crush is pejorative all on its own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked at that. “Protective.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Over-protective…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Giving the other space and freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not being close enough to each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then always staying by the other person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Being far too clingy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Commitment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Limitations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A long-lasting love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A stale, passionless love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A young, passionate love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A brief, vainglorious love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They giggled. Kaname shook her head, amused at the word-game. “Okay, you’re good at this one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  seeing a pattern. You can’t really be too smart or too beautiful, but  in terms of this, it’s more complicated, isn’t it?” Momomi replied  wryly. “You can have too much or too little of almost anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damned if you, damned if you don’t.” Kaname chuckled again. “It’s all so nonsensical. How about true love, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… no, that’s something everyone agrees on, isn’t it? But then again, how do you tell what true love is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a bit pointless without being able to tell, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  at the end of the day, the only designation everyone agrees on is  basically arbitrary and semantic,” Kaname observed, shrugging  theatrically. “What a dreary world we live in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One more thing,  though. About true love?” Momomi giggled. “Could true love have  something to do with sitting around for an age when we should be doing  revision?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “Damnit! That’s not true love! That’s you being a deceptive pain in the arse! Get off, we have work to do!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  I only just remembered myself,” Momomi complained, sitting up. “So  don’t get all righteous. It’s not like you didn’t forget yourself,  madam cold and cool.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you were distracting me,” Kaname muttered. “But whatever. We should just do everything we can now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do we have to? We haven’t eaten yet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should eat while you write,” Kaname replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Next time, I won’t tell you, and see how long it takes for you to realise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you dare.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I dare. I also know you love it really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… looks like you admit it too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname tried to find the right page in the History book, sighing herself. <em>The  downside of having a girlfriend. It’s bad for your revision schedule.  But at least it gives me something to think about besides Amane and her  damned good acting…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly, though. You’re still so dishonest. What’s the rush, when you were so serene a few moments ago?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re going to do some work this lunchtime,” Kaname replied. “Even if it kills me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted. “Still so proud and stubborn. You’re as bad as Amane-san…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I take it back! You really do distract me and annoy me all the time!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  So I distract you when I’m around you?” Momomi teased. “That’s good to  know. I guess it’s good I’m not in the same class as you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you could stop flirting with me for two seconds-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not on your life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you want to pass this exam or not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll just plead mitigating circumstances with the Etoiles. They understand this kind of thing, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure girl’s love will cut a lot of ice with the Superior!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows? Perhaps she’s a closet romantic…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That old bat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not as strange as you being romantic, but that appears to have come true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s just an insult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just the way it is…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname put on an annoyed face, becoming aware that she was putting it on. <em>Actually,  I’m enjoying this. That’s far too weird. But then again, we’ve always  sniped at each other like this, and I’ve always enjoyed it. Is that  anything so innocent as liking or loving? Knowing us, it’s something a  lot darker. Serenity is enjoyable, but it’s like this that I come  alive. What would you call it? </em>Kaname shook her head to clear her thoughts, feeling the weight of Momomi leaning on her again. <em>Not  love, not hate, not anger, not lust. I don’t really have a name for it.  But I do know the colour. It’s not the delicate pink-red of a loving  heart. This is a dark red emotion, the shade of blood. </em>Kaname closed her eyes for a moment, snorting slightly. <em>And is blood is life itself.</em></span></p>
