<p>“Nervous?”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really,” Momomi said, sighing and shrugging off her jacket. She folded  it neatly and put it over her chair by the desk. She pulled her necktie  free and placed it on the table, smoothing it out, then looked over at  Kaname. “Lazy as ever.” She glared at her friend’s fallen blazer. “Pick  that up and pass it here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled and did as she was instructed. “You’re very casual, considering.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  very casual precisely because they’re coming tomorrow,” Momomi said  shortly. “I won’t gain anything by panicking, after all. I’m damned if  I’ll do him that much of a favour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have a strange  attitude.” Kaname leaned back on her bed, folding her arms behind her  head and propping herself up. “Where were you, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Finishing that damned book in the library. Now I’ve got satirical literature dripping out of my ears, but at least it’s done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could have read that here,” Kaname accused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you would have distracted me,” Momomi replied, shrugging and sitting on  her own bed. “Besides, when I first got back here you weren’t there.  Still busy mastering kendo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m improving fast. Soon enough, I’ll have a handle on the whole striking technique thing, and then I can really take off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such a violent sport,” Momomi sighed. “It suits you very well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  still don’t consider it very practical training, as it requires a sword  to work. It’s a sport in the purest sense, in that respect, and the  violence is fairly mild.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so… but I’m still surprised at your enthusiasm, especially because it’s not practical training.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just don’t like Amiki winning all the time, so I’ll keep fighting until  I’ve beaten her. Besides, I promised you, didn’t I? I might as well go  all out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish I could have that kind of attitude.” Momomi  rolled back, holding her hands on her stomach. “But I’m far too lazy  for it. Perhaps because I’m not really in competition with Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  pretty ironic, considering it’s your parents, but I suppose it’s fine.  They’re not going to take that much interest, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi closed her eyes. “Have you taken a shower yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should do so. I bet you smell of kendo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “I love the conviction in your voice. How can I smell of kendo, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure, but it’s probably not pleasant. And wash your hair as well,  while you’re there. As my best friend, I need you looking pristine to  make a good impression.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright. As demanding as ever.” Kaname stood, unbuttoning her shirt as she walked to the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just want to make sure you stay clean and healthy, considering we’ve  proved too many times that you can’t do it yourself.” Momomi smiled,  undoing her own top buttons to give her more room to breathe. “After  all, if you caught some kind of disease it’d endanger me as well,  considering I’m your roommate. It’s just sensible of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  much for your kind concern,” Kaname said, her voice muffled as she  spoke through the wall. “A little sweat never did anyone any harm. It’s  a natural thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So’s living in the mud, but we don’t do that  either.” Momomi pushed herself off her bed, kicking off her shoes and  sitting on Kaname’s, which was closer to the bathroom. She put her back  to the wall and closed her eyes, smiling. “Enjoy the fruits of  civilisation, already. One of them is being clean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That kind of  thing is just an inconvenience, an exaggeration of conditions. I’m  pretty sure that by sheltering ourselves like this we’re only made more  vulnerable in the long term.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps, but look at it this way; because of cleanliness, we get to experience a long-term.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you know,” Kaname said, raising her voice to speak through the wall and  over the now-steady sound of falling water, “I do sometimes wonder  whether I was born in the wrong period. However you look at it, I’m a  violent person in a world that’s moved away from that. It’s not like I  can’t do what I want in my home, where I ostensibly belong, but I won’t  get any recognition for that, because society doesn’t respect brute  strength as much any more. That’s one of the reasons why I came here,  so I can work on something that will be recognised. But I’m not sure  how well that’s working.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, even if brute force was so loved  back then, women certainly. If you were yourself, I doubt you’d be able  to stand it. Keeping house in a feudal castle and waiting for your lord  to come home, or more likely toiling in the fields like a peasant.  Well, as a peasant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so, but there were still some  women. Joan of Arc and people. She embarrassed a lot of French  generals, really, and the English too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She also got burned on  the stake as a witch,” Momomi pointed out. “Those were times when  females had to be exceptional to be noticed. And even then, they were  endangered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Kaname admitted. “But, in a way,  that’s nice. I’m in a similar position, really, but it’s not because  I’m a woman. It’s where I was born. Opportunities are still far from  equal; everything’s just shifted now. At least women were 50 of the  population.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose you’re right,” Momomi admitted. “You’ve  had a hard time of it, from what I can tell. But you still made it, so  the system at least works a little. But I guess that’s because you  really are exceptional.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Precisely. Immodest but accurate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  shouldn’t sell yourself short, though. I think with your intelligence  you’re still better suited to the modern world. It’s a more valuable  trait than merely being strong and fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course, it’s  not like I lack the ability. But I’m not so convinced that I have the  personality. A lot of that stuff bores me to tears.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll get better,” Momomi assured her. “I believe in you, after all, and it’s not just because you’re good at hurting people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure how much your belief is worth in the real world.” But Momomi  fancied that her friend sounded gratified, all the same.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  yawned and stretched, lying down and placing her head on Kaname’s  pillow. She fancied it smelled a little of her friend, which was to  say, mostly of sweat. But it was comfortable beyond that. <em>I wonder  what would she do if she came back to find me asleep in her bed? Sleep  in my bed? Try to move me without waking? Yell at me until I woke up? I  don’t know what she’d do but finding out is getting more and more  attractive as a proposition. It’d be funny, at least. But she’d  probably kill me when she worked it out. </em>Out loud she deftly voiced quite different questions. “So, what’s your dream, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My dream?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  dream, you know, your ultimate ambition. It doesn’t have to be  realistic, just what you want from life. I don’t think I’ve ever asked  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname was silent for a few moments filled with the spray  and drip of water. “Well, it’s not something I’ve ever thought much  about. But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose it would be something like,  to be filthy rich, respected and feared by a bunch of people, and to  have my kids going to private school. If I have kids, which I sincerely  doubt. I can’t imagine a man I’d stand and they’d get in the way of my  important career. But if I did have kids, I’d send them to private  school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s lips quirked into a smile. <em>Somehow, I’m not too surprised. </em>“Isn’t that a bit hypocritical of you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.  I just hate you children of privilege. If I can pull myself up that  far, it just shows you all up, and then I can propagate the next  generation.” Kaname paused for a moment, probably shrugging. “I don’t  mind inequality if it works in my favour, basically. That said, there  does need to be more equality of opportunity. A meritocracy, in short.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  say that because you’re long on intelligence and short on patience,”  Momomi said, amused. “What about all the stupid people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They can do stupid jobs. My way makes more sense than what we have now, it’s fairer, and it has more efficiency in it as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s more efficient, but not exactly fair. Isn’t intelligence as arbitrary a gift of birth as social standing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,  but it’s a more important one. What can I say, I’m a social climber at  heart. If only to see the look on your parents faces when I’m their  equals.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed again. <em>There’s something about her naked, unashamed ambition and double standards, which is vaguely endearing. </em>“And what’s your career going to be? Your road to the top?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not sure on that. Something professional and important. Perhaps a doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From someone who can’t even shower properly without my prompts?” Momomi asked. “That doesn’t suit you at all. Maybe… a lawyer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A lawyer? I hate lawyers, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you hate everyone in the upper classes, but you still want to join  them. I think you’d make a good lawyer, prosecuting people with  relentless zeal and the occasional deceptive moment. The defence would  quiver in fear whenever you walked into a courtroom.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. I suppose I could get used to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can see it now. You leave here, then university, then your law  training, and then you spend ten years as a high-flying lawyers and  five as a judge before quitting to enter the world of politics. Elected  to the diet, Prime Minister before you’re 50. Well, I guess I can  dream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s certainly your dream, not mine. Let me make up my own fantasy future, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, Kaname, but I couldn’t resist.” Momomi giggled. “You running the country, now there’s a terrible thought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. I could do things a lot better than the common crop of incompetents. How about you, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  closed her eyes, considering. “Well, sometimes I think I’d like to be a  writer. Probably of romances, that’s what I read, after all, and when  you’ve read a few you start to realise the formula they all use. It’s  pretty simple, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. A wishy-washy kind of dream, as I’d expected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  my main dream is to be a lawyer, which is why I suggested it for you.  Studying law at university together could be fun, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More like scary. We’ll be spending four more years together as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Poor  me, Kaname’s already tired of my company,” Momomi moaned. “That hurts  my feelings. But I’ve always been interested in a life like that. To  work on something tough but interesting, earning not inconsiderable  amounts of money, and living here in Japan for good, without any  reliance on my father. That’s my dream. I don’t need to be rich, just  comfortable; though rich could be a good way to further slap my  father’s face. But I don’t to be dependent on the Phareli name any  more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you hate your family that much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked,  surprised at Kaname’s tone. “Well, I only really hate my father… though  I can’t say I like my mother. But I don’t want to be controlled by  them, and I have a suspicion that by the end they won’t be able to  accept me anyway. It’s not like I want to cut all my ties with them,  unless it proves necessary, but I do want to be independent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you wouldn’t move back to Italy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  hasn’t been very long, but by the time I’m through with this school I’m  fairly sure I’ll want to stay. It’s several thousand miles from my  father, for a start, and I could get used to all you Japanese people  and your funny ways.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a big decision to make.” Kaname  sighed. “I’ve said this before, but you should be careful not to give  up your family out of pride. You’re not like me; you have a proper  family and a sister you love. Don’t be careless with something that  precious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, but we’re still fairly broken. Thanks for  worrying, though.” Momomi closed her eyes. “But ultimately, this is  just talk about silly dreams, right? You have four years to change my  mind, if you’re that worried.” Momomi frowned once she’d finished  speaking. The sound of water had stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not that worried. It was just a thought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  stretched idly and rolled off the bed, walking to the dresser and  picking up her wide-tooth comb. “Here,” she said, opening the door with  one hand and holding it up with the other. “You should-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked up with surprise, in the middle of drying her legs. “You and  your fussing,” she said, holding up one hand and taking the comb. “I  get it, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi compulsively glanced downwards and  blushed red, turning away hastily. “Sorry!” She retreated behind the  door. “I thought you were drying yourself in the shower!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Why would I do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I told you,” Momomi said in a low voice, sounding annoyed. “It keeps  our floor dry.” She rested her head against the wall, closing her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a bathroom floor. It’s meant to get wet. You really do fuss far too  much. Besides, what’s to apologise for? It’s not like you haven’t seen  me naked before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that,” Momomi replied, irritated. “But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a little weird, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Kaname stuck her head through the door and glanced amusedly at Momomi,  her towel mercifully wrapped round her body this time. “You’re not  starting to think like Amiki, are you?” she teased. “That would be too  strange.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not,” Momomi said, turning to glower back but keeping her head slightly raised. “What’s it to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just find it odd, that’s all,” Kaname said, eyes glittering with amusement. “You’re blushing, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up, and get back in there!” Momomi pushed her friend by the face,  shoving her back into the bathroom. “You’ll get water on the carpet!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  yes,” Kaname said. “Well, it’s not like I blame you. Hanging around the  Etoiles who act as they do, you start to think carefully to avoid  misunderstandings, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… I guess so,” Momomi said. “That makes sense, actually. In a weird school like this-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I thought you said you didn’t care about the opinions of most people. I suppose I’m a special case. I’m flattered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scowled. “Stop teasing me, already! It’s annoying!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s usually you teasing me. This makes a nice change, that’s all. And I can’t say I’m not enjoying it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi closed her eyes again, trying to still her racing pulse. <em>Damnit! What the hell was that? That was definitely not normal! </em>She took deep breaths, trying to blank her mind and regain her composure. <em>I’ve already let Kaname rip into me some, so I need to stay on the ball, damnit. No more showing weakness like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  out,” Kaname said a few minutes later. She was dressed in her trousers  and an untucked shirt, her hands thrust casually into her pockets. Her  hair was still dripping wet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven’t dried yourself properly again,” Momomi said. “You’re going to wet that shirt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’ll be fine. I’m wearing a fresh one tomorrow anyway. On your orders, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s no excuse for being sloppy, though.” Momomi marched past her friend and slammed the door, breathing out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Man,  bitchy or what…” Footsteps echoed through the door, ending with a  slight whumph as Kaname propelled herself onto her bed. “What did I do  to deserve this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing! I’m not being bitchy, either!” Momomi bit her lip, frustrated with how flustered she was. <em>God,  I’m overreacting. I can only hope that she’s too selectively dumb to  put two and two together. People are her weak point, luckily. </em>She  unbuttoned her shirt and found a dry corner of the bathroom, stripping  rapidly and stepping into the shower. Once again, the warm water washed  refreshingly over her. It took a few seconds before she registered that  Kaname had said something. “Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was just asking whether  you were alright,” Kaname said irritably. “Don’t press the point too  much. But if I’ve upset you or something, I want you to tell me. Though  it’d be a bit ridiculous if you were upset, having put me through all  that stuff you do to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled weakly. <em>That’s so very Kaname, as a way of expressing concern. </em>She took a breath, then smiled weakly. “I’m fine, thanks. Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. I guess it’s the nerves after all, even if you won’t admit it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite possibly.” <em>Is that true? I can’t see the correlation…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi resisted the temptation to lean against the wall again. <em>That would be too much like weakness, even if no one can see me. I would know, after all. </em>But she closed her eyes and slapped herself in frustration. <em>Keep  it together, Momomi. That wasn’t the normal way to look at your best  friend naked. That was weird. I felt shocked and embarrassed and  slightly guilty and slightly confused, and I reacted like that. She’s  right. It’s not like you’ve not seen her naked before, just like she  said. You see girls naked in the changing rooms every time you go  swimming, and that’s fine too. That doesn’t make it embarrassing. </em>She bowed her head, feeling an uncomfortable mix of emotions. <em>Well,  it’s not like I don’t know who I am. I’ve looked at other girls in a…  sexual way before, but just to watch, in the pool or wherever else,  when I see someone pretty or shapely. I’m not in denial about that,  even if I don’t like to talk about it. That’s just the way it is.  Perhaps it’s this school screwing up my head in some way. More likely,  I’m like that, and I’m fine with it. </em>Water washed down her shoulders, dragging out her hair and sticking it to her skin. <em>Like  it or hate it, I can accept that in an environment like this, I’d be  stupid not to. Even if some people, starting with my father, would hate  it, there are people who would support me. But… but that’s completely  different from thinking strange things about your best friend! </em>Momomi slammed one of her palms into the wall, biting her lip in frustration. <em>I’ve  always known that. Even if I like to admire girls, I’ve never done that  with Kaname. Well, I know she’s handsome, but I don’t…feel it. I’ve  never thought about her that way.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That’s what she told herself, anyway. There were some uncomfortably nagging doubts rising in the back of her head. <em>Well,  you just did for a start, but that’s not something that just happens.  This is the first time you’ve seen her naked in a while, when you think  about it, even if it has happened before. And how about that time? Her  important thing she had to say to you, remember that? You spent half  the morning fretting yourself into a frenzy about the prospect of her  imminent love confession! And of course, she was actually thinking  about something else, something completely different and perfectly  innocent. You’re the dirty-minded one, after all. </em>She sighed heavily. <em>That  assumption made so much sense that the time, but it’s getting harder to  take it seriously with the benefit of hindsight. Was it reasonable? Did  I make a fair assumption, or was… was I just being wishful? </em>She closed her eyes. <em>God,  that makes me sound so stupid. I don’t know, though, and it’s not like  I can ask anyone without giving the game away. The Etoiles? God no.  Shion? Yeah, take relationship advice from the year three loner. And  not just that, but when I think about it, I was nervous, horribly  nervous, but I was probably excited as well. Did I actually welcome the  idea of her confessing to me? Of course not! At least, I don’t think  so, but it’s so hard to tell…I’m normally definite, but this time my  feelings are so hard to grasp, it’s impossible to say what’s running  through my head from moment to moment. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, you sure you’re not mad or anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Momomi said, straightening. “I’m just taking a shower. Why would I be mad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  knows. Considering I talked to bored you so nicely when I was in the  shower, I’d expected as much of you. But maybe you like taking without  giving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not like you’ve suggested anything to talk about,” Momomi replied, pouting to herself. <em>It feels good, to be annoyed with her. Especially right now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nor have you, you know, so you’re no better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  forgive me, I was concentrating on showering. Unlike you, I make  hygiene a priority, so it’s hardly surprising that I take it more  seriously than you do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. And after you make so much of how  you’re going to sort out my own habits, you then put me through a  distraction you weren’t permit in yourself. That’s pretty hypocritical,  which in itself is normal for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you didn’t want to talk to me, all you had to do was say so, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, unlike you, I have some manners.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right. Manners is also something I definitely have to teach you, and it isn’t something you’ve learned yet, either.” <em>A leaden soul and words made of ash. It’s amazing how a simple little thing can ruin my evening. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Say what you like. I’m not the bitchy one here and now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  if there is something, I want you to tell me.” Kaname’s voice was more  serious now. “That’s how you screwed me over anyway, not talking, so  you shouldn’t repeat it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s nothing. But thanks, again. It  means a lot to me… even if you’re still too insecure to say things  straight.” Momomi tried to smile but couldn’t quite, so she leaned  against the wall and closed her eyes, imagining Kaname in the exact  same position on the other side, separated by a few inches of plaster. <em>Amazing how we can be so close, but so far from touching. That has to symbolise something, I just wish I knew what.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Speaking  of touching, that’s another good one, isn’t it? I thought myself, at  that time, that I’d lead her on, intentionally or unintentionally. It’d  definitely be worse if the only person I was leading on was myself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Say what you want, mysterious one. What’s the agenda for tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>All  the times where I hold her, by the arm or whatever else, playing with  her food and making her retaliate, teasing her with romantic words, I  always knew that felt good. I thought that was just the pleasure of  teasing her and making her awkward, but- </em>Momomi remembered  herself. “Ahh… well, I have the morning off to greet my parents. So  I’ll start with that. You go to lessons like a good girl until break,  then we’ll meet and I’ll introduce you along with the others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t  I just skip and meet them straight away? Forget what the Etoiles say.  This is a lot more important to me than a bunch of random lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flushed slightly. <em>But  like that, I never fooled myself with that. When she says those things  are important to her, when she says she wants to protect me, it’s the  same feeling. </em>“I’ll think about it in the morning, and judge the situation. That’s best.” <em>When I hold her arm, it feels good, it feels safe.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, general. We’re meeting headquarters tomorrow, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi remembered that old joke and smiled weakly. <em>I  enjoy that, and I suppose I always have wished… wondered… whether she’d  wrap her arms around me and protect me. Like I did to her long ago,  when everything began. </em>“Of course, so be on your best behaviour. Don’t randomly assault people, like I said before.” <em>I wish that she’d do that when I’m just me, to shield me, and show… and show what?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You told me already. There’s no need for you to repeat yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Talking to you, it bears repeating.” <em>Her  friendship? Her loyalty? Her strength? Her love? I thought I knew what  I wanted from her, but I sometimes wonder whether I’m not misjudging  myself. </em>“And remember, my father’s stubborn. Don’t argue with him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have plenty of experience with that type of person. I talk to you every day, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  want to feel safe and comfortable in her arms, like I’m not alone, like  a little child, knowing it’s okay to be like that, to show that  weakness. But I don’t know that so I can’t do that and these things  build up inside me. </em>“Well, considering I talk to you, we should  both be set on that front. But what he could do to me is rather worse  than me stealing your egg.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Perhaps I should just go with  that, but I don’t know how she’d respond. And if I’m too diffident to  even do that, then anything more won’t ever happen. That’s right. My  own feelings don’t matter if I’ll never act on them anyway. So instead  of getting mixed up in hope and worry, I should just accept things for  the way they are. Kaname’s my friend. Whether I’m romantically  interested in her or not, just keeping things that way will have to be  enough. Yeah, that makes sense-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi! Are you listening?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Sorry. I missed that last bit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You,  girl, spacing out like that… it’s horribly inattentive. I suppose you  have good reasons to worry, though. You’re all talk, but the prospect  does unnerve you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess you’re right.” Momomi forced a laugh.  “It is a little worrying, when I have to beg for mercy from the man I  hate, who doesn’t like me much either and also happens to be my  father…” <em>What’s she looking like, right now? She’s speaking with  that cynicism and mild accusation, again, but are her eyes closed,  delivering a statement, or is she looking at me the way she does, eyes  alive, head tilted slightly as she’s sprawled over her bed. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now  that’s a fairly ironic situation. Well, I suppose it’s about par for  someone like you, who doesn’t have anything but weird relationships.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  lighter tone this time, but still…I’ve never been this frustrated by a  wall since the last time Amiki was pushing me against one. At the same  time, I don’t want to face her. </em>“Something like that,” Momomi said  weakly. She remembered her place, and added “not that you can talk,  with your screwed up background and relationships.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Well,  there’s not a lot to be said for normal relationships anyway.” This  time her voice was in fully-fledged cynicism mode, the voice she used  when she passed a sweeping judgement on some aspect of humanity. “With  most people, they’re just excessive vulnerabilities, something of  convenience. When someone like you or I forge a bond, you know it’s  important and valuable, because we don’t do that easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s… true.” <em>What does she mean by that? No, don’t read too much into things. That’s what happened before. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gritted her teeth. <em>Well, I know a chance when I see one. </em>“Say, Kaname…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  considered her words for a moment. “If you were a parent, and you’d  discovered that your child was gay… what would you make of that? How  would you react to it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, hey, you don’t mean your father by this parent, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of-  of course not,” Momomi said, blushing furiously. “It’s just a  hypothetical question. In a school like this, it makes sense to ask,  too.” <em>I’m such a coward.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right there. Well, I  wouldn’t shout at her or disown her or anything dramatic and stupid.  It’s nothing to do with me. Just as long as they keep it out of my  sight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Out of your sight?” <em>Here comes the sinking feeling…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s a bit weird, isn’t it? Not something you’d show off.” Kaname’s  voice was surprisingly careful and controlled. “I’m hardly religious,  you know that, and I’m not a homophobe. That would be impossible in  this school. But it’s not something I’d like to watch or anything. The  Etoiles are a little creepy at times, and they keep things fairly  chaste. As for the rest… I don’t know, sometimes it’s weird, sometimes  it’s just funny, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right. I think I understand.” Momomi closed her eyes, feeling a strange sense of disappointment settle in her chest. <em>I  shouldn’t be too surprised. Kaname’s always been like this. It must be  troublesome, to be the normal girl in a school full of freaks. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you? How would you react? The same way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There. At least go this far, or forever remain a spineless weakling. </em>“I’d…  I wouldn’t mind,” Momomi replied. “Love is love, I think, even if that  sounds cliché, and it’s the same biological process working in  different ways… it’s not something to be ashamed of. So I’d let my  child do anything she should feel natural about doing in front of me,  even if it was kissing another girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? So you don’t find that odd? Jeez, you shouldn’t make me feel like a minority here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi closed her eyes and bit her lip in frustration. <em>Don’t make it out as if you’re the weird one! It’s the complete opposite! </em>“Well, I… guess it just doesn’t bother me,” she sighed. <em>Actually, it does bother me sometimes, but not in the way that you think…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shut off the water and reached out, picking up the towel that had been  thrown casually onto the floor and starting to dry herself off. Then  she remembered who had last used it, and somehow she imagined that  Kaname’s scent lingered on it, and her mind’s eye remembered her lithe  body, water still dripping down her surprisingly beautiful skin- Momomi  dropped the towel and slapped herself on both cheeks, closing her eyes. <em>What’s happening to me? It’s like I wake up one morning and see everything differently. I feel… dirtied. </em>She  reached for another towel then stopped herself. That would be the  ultimate admission that something had changed. She picked up Kaname’s  towel again instead, rubbing the slightly damp surface across her body  as fast as she could. Her skin protested at the rough treatment but she  ignored that, throwing the towel down again and stepping out of the  shower. She pulled on her clothes, doing her shirt up to the very top,  then checked herself in the mirror, eyes narrowed and searching for any  lingering trace of a blush. Finding none she turned away and walked  back into their room. “I’m out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome back.” Kaname smiled. “But shouldn’t you brush your hair?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Splayed  out like that, with her casual dress and her casual attitude, it’s too  easy to watch. I wish I knew how to fill a space so completely and yet  so comfortably.</em> Momomi smiled back. “You’re right, I’d forgotten.”  She turned away again, pulling a sodden lock of brown hair out of her  eyes. Somehow her long hair felt choking now. <em>Damn it. Damnit! If  this is what they call an epithany, you can keep it. When your view of  the world seems to change that fast, it just leaves you lost in a  landscape you don’t recognise. Only an idiot would enjoy that, and I’m  no idiot…but I do feel lost. Which just leaves me even more screwed,  when I think about it. To be an idiot, or to be without these thoughts,  they sound pleasant now.</em></span></p>
