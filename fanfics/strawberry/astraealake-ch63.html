<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This was an  interesting chapter to write, as unlike early chapters in this vein  little is made explicit. On that note, Amane's family is styled on and  has slight references to a major character of a far different anime. So  anyone who notices can feel very smug and self-satisfied.</span></p>

“Good evening,” Momomi said, waving.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked up, surprised, and then pushed herself off the ground, standing and frowning at the other girl. “Good evening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t believe I actually found you. Do you live here?” Momomi gave her  a teasing grin, sauntering forwards and stopping with a casual hand on  her hip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “I just like it here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  well. Considering I spent so long up my room, I don’t suppose I can  talk.” Momomi leaned against the fence. “So you aren’t riding right  now? That’s what you’re normally doing at this time of the evening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I felt like a change,” Amane replied blandly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Makes sense. It must get boring after a while…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi closed her eyes and pinched herself on the nose. “I see. In any case, have you seen Olesa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Olesa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  been absent without leave.” Momomi folded her eyes and sighed  theatrically. “She disappeared the moment we were finished in the  Church, but she wasn’t at the library where we’re supposed to meet. I  waited fifteen minutes and she still didn’t show.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane frowned. “That’s unusual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. As much as I enjoy bashing Olesa, she’s punctual, at the very  least. This is the first time she’s been late on me.” Momomi frowned.  “Well, do you know anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “When she does visit me, it’s generally later than this. In that, too, she is reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see.” Momomi rubbed her eyes irritably. “Well, this is a bother. I  don’t suppose you know where she is? I haven’t tried her room yet, as I  came here first. I guess that’s the first place to start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi raised her eyebrows. “Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “If she’s doing this, the situation is unusual. It isn’t likely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t have any better ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it important?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  kind of. We have to finish up the script for the auditions pretty soon,  so it’d bad if we just skipped a day.” Momomi shrugged. “On the other  hand, I think I have more than half an idea of why she’s skipping in  the first place. Perhaps I’ll forgive her, just this once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Amane looked away, smiling thinly. “But I, for once, I’m surprised. I thought that you’d come to see me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. “So you’ve been missing me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “It was the most obvious reason for you to come.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see…” Momomi stretched, folding her arms behind her head. “Well, in any  case, I don’t have anywhere else to be right now. I might as well stick  around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded, joining her by the fence without a word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  still a huge bother, though, having to go to the Church every day…  annoying.” Momomi glanced at the blue-haired girl. “Well? How about  you? Have you ever been punished like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  thought so. Well, it’s not like you have done anything that deserves  punishment, by all accounts.” Momomi shrugged. “Well, I don’t recommend  it, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But for us it’s more  like a bizarre social club. Complete with hissy Kariya and playful  Serané.” Momomi shrugged. “Which sounds more fun than it actually is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But yeah,” Momomi said vaguely. “We manage, somehow. I can’t wait until we’re finally through with our punishment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded, her eyes absent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed loudly. “Hey, you! You could at least listen, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m listening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  show that, make some reply, anything.” Momomi snorted. “It’s tiring if  you just sit there and listen without saying a word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “Looks like some things don’t change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced at her, crimson eyes focusing curiously. “Could I ask you some questions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. If you like. It’s better than silence, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you interested in?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stuck her hands in her pockets casually, looking away. “It’s a simple question.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  a moment, in posture and tone, she looked so much like Kaname that  Momomi couldn’t help but smile. “Fine. Romance novels, languages, art,  creative writing, poetry, flowers… that’s about it, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane closed her eyes. “Why those, in particular?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, don’t I get a question? What are your interests?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Riding, reading, and a few other things,” Amane replied vaguely. “Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Well, I didn’t think about it too much, you know. There aren’t any deep meanings involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You must have some idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really… but let’s see. The books are something I picked up at this  school’s library. The rest are pretty much things I was instructed in  at home, but I took them beyond that and developed my own interest in  them. I don’t really have the time for that stuff any more.” Momomi  frowned. “Except for the flowers. That was really my mother’s hobby.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty  much. She found it was a good way to kill time. She’s a big fan of  gardens and things. She taught me some things.” Momomi grinned. “How  about you? Does your mother ride a lot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked at her uneasily, then shrugged. “More or less.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some things don’t change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s strange, isn’t it?” Amane frowned. “The Phareli heir-but-one, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  blood, yes. In fact, I’m probably heir-but-two going on disowned.”  Momomi laughed. “To be honest, I never really took too much interest in  that kind of thing. It would benefit my sister, but not me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about your sister?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My sister?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did she learn the same things as you, or differently?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know.” Momomi shrugged. “We were both taught by the same kind of tutors. But I suppose they could have changed them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked puzzled. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smirked. “And you’re a cousin, aren’t you? Fifth in line, after the  main family’s three brothers and your older sister. All the same,  you’ll do very well for yourself. Your family is simply that big.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who told you about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  no one in particular. But my mother made me aware of these things, you  know.” Momomi shook her hair out idly, turning a lock of brown hair  between her fingers. “The families of Japan, and polite society in  general, and everything to do with it. I’m surprisingly knowledgeable.  Especially in comparison to the kind of narrow-minded provincial who  forgets the international stage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hence the languages, as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “More or less. Like flowers, this was her hobby. It’s been passed on to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “I see… tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does she say about my family? What does she know about my family?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “That’s quite a question, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m curious. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s fine. But what answer do you want? The polite one, or the genuine one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The genuine one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  nodded. “Well, what can I remember… the Ohtori are among the rich  elite, with historical roots. But they’ve gone through what my mother  calls a break from tradition, which is to say you’ve changed with the  times. Now the family is essentially an empire combining private  medical and pharmaceutical concerns with production of hospital  machinery as well. Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  respectable, filthy rich and business orientated.” Momomi frowned. “But  that’s about it, really. I never met any of you. Prior to coming here,  I had little contact with Japan, as a matter of my father’s principle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane nodded briefly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?” Momomi teased. “How did I do? Did I get all the important points?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who will be the heir of the Phareli?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned at the non sequitur. “Let’s see… probably my sister.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  there was some prospect of Araldo representing a challenger. My  father’s a chauvinistic bastard, for a start. But between his  personality and the Serané debacle, I think it’s most likely that my  sister will get the title of head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it’s not just the hereditary principle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not. That would be stupid.” Momomi smiled sweetly. “What would  we do if my hypothetical older brother was an idiot, for example? The  whole family would be stuck as a result of a few primitive traditions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “That much makes sense. But how about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed. “Now that isn’t going to happen. I burned my boats with my  father a few weeks ago, and that is that. Unless Luigia becomes a gay  stripper and Araldo runs off the join the circus, or such like… it’s a  settled matter, I suspect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So the judgement is just the Head’s arbitrary ruling?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.  As I understand it, it’s whoever impresses him the most. Luigia is  probably the most competent of us, and she isn't exactly too  controversial either. So it’s still no surprise that she should be  ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “That still appears arbitrary. Who is your father to judge?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, he’s my father.” Momomi sighed. “You know how it is, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And how does your family work? Something similar? Are you still in the running?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still  in the running, but without very good odds. My cousins are older and  extremely gifted.” Amane folded her arms and closed her eyes. “Compared  to them, I am a feeble personality. It’s a matter that will be decided  between those three.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “That kind of talk is a little depressive, isn’t it? You should have a more positive attitude, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said something very similar just now. You, too, consider yourself defeated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Well, that’s true, I guess. So I’m not in any position to talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “People like us know our limits. It’s only intelligent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stretched, looking up at a darkening sky. “But still, if you have relatives who humble you, they must be amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  are.” Amane looked down at the floor, eyes far away. “For my family,  the arts aren’t of interest… we’re all raised to turn money into more  money. That’s the theory, anyway, and all my cousins follow that  template.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned. “I hate stuff like that. Whatever you  say about my family, at least they gave me a good, broad education…  well, admittedly it’s partly guided by my father’s sexism. He considers  the arts good for women as they should stay at home, but now that it’s  clear there’ll be no son he’s had to change that position.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you aren’t so different from us after all. The edict was different,  that’s all.” Amane frowned. “As you say, some things don’t change. This  is consistent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “That much makes sense. You were homeschooled, I take it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Initially.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Initially? Well, obviously you’re here…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  uncle said we should all go to high school. Homeschooled children don’t  have the proper social skills and experience required to lead. That’s  what he said.” Amane rubbed her leg thoughtfully. “He was very clear on  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “That would sound more impressive if it  wasn’t for the fact that they sent you here, one of the cosiest and  most genteel schools imaginable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why were you sent here? To receive a good education?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  hell. Tutors at home are still teaching my sister… and she has plenty  of friends, thank you very much. But that’s not the point. This was  basically a punishment for bad behaviour.” Momomi shrugged. “It’s  sometimes hard to believe that your life can turn on such points, but  it’s true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane chuckled. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi bridled. “What’s so funny? Now I’m here because I like it, you know. It isn’t that bad-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”  Amane shook her head. “I was just thinking. If an Ohtori was to attend  anything but the most prestigious school in the country, you’d know  that they’d made a mistake somewhere down the line. For an Phareli,  it’s the opposite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you put it that way, it does sound a  little stupid. We’re punishing you by sending you to a private school  most people can’t even dream of attending…” Momomi sighed. “Well, I’ve  only ever had a loose sense of perspective.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. It’s fine.” Amane shook her head. “More importantly, what is your sister like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  a great person,” Momomi replied enthusiastically. “Clever and kind, and  she’s always looked after me. She backs me up in arguments with my  father, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Plus she really  cares for me. Even though we differ on so many things, starting with  the whole religious issue, we still get by. She’s willing to make an  effort to accept me.” Momomi smiled wanly. “That’s something important  for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about your sister, then? Or your cousins?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. “So, you don’t get on well? That’s too bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re not expected to get on well with each other.” Amane shrugged. “And your cousin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He’s  a weak-willed idiot, but I kinda like him.” Momomi waved her hands. “I  don’t know, it’s like we’re barely related at all. There’s me, who  argues all the damn time and gets into trouble for the hell of it and  is generally the most impudent little wart under the sun. Araldo is my  opposite, who likes peaceful solutions to everyone’s problems and tends  to take cover behind the sofa when I kick into high gear. And then  Luigia prays all the damn time and tries to protect us both without  ever intending to be argumentative. But somehow, she’s often the worst  of us for it. We hardly make sense as a family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane chuckled. “Honestly, that is very peculiar, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re  both complete idiots in their own ways, but I do miss them.” Momomi  sighed, scratching her cheek. “It’s not something I can talk to Kaname  about, as a result of her own circumstances. But when I’m here and they  are at home, we’ll grow apart. I knew that was the true when I met them  again recently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In a way, isn’t it good? You have a chance to  grow independently and outshine them both, don’t you?” Amane shook her  head. “It is probably good for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps. Doesn’t mean I  like it, though.” Momomi laughed. “You know, I really shouldn’t be  talking to you about this, but what the hell. I never really had any  friends. I suppose you could call Kaname my first friend. So when I was  here for the first few weeks, without Luigia, it was very hard.  Everyone was already sorted into their own cliques, and in any case I  thought it’d be too painful if I exposed myself like I had before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before?” Amane queried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about it,” Momomi replied hurriedly. “In any case, it was hard. I  felt very isolated with no one to listen to me or even care that I  existed. I’d gone from being Luigia’s important little sister to a no  one, overnight. Perhaps that was my father’s idea. Either way, it made  me very sad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Kenjou befriended you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled.  “That Kenjou? Do you think it was that easy? No, it didn’t matter how  much I wanted to cry, I never did, just in case she’d catch me. I was  determined not to drop my guard and lose to someone like her.  Ironically, it was that thought and those feelings that gave me  something, anything to hold onto, besides my own aching loneliness.  That’s strange, I know, but it was important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you want to beat someone, you can justify being so alone. You can  smother the pain more easily and rely on pride more readily. As a  coping device, my arguments with Kaname were wonderful.” Momomi rubbed  her forehead. “Of course, they caused me stress and exhaustion and  misery in their own right. But nothing in this life is free, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “But that’s unusual, I think. Your relationship with your sister.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s brow wrinkled. “You think? Under the circumstances, I should think it’d be pretty normal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then perhaps I’m the abnormal one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, you didn’t get on with your sister?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not particularly. It was discouraged.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Discouraged?” Momomi sighed, leaning back. “I see. Your parents?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And my uncle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. The big shot himself. And I’d dared hope that only my father  was like that, too. So all aristocratic parents are like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  all parents, even?” Momomi chuckled. “No, I’m not miserable enough to  believe that. Olesa really loves her mother, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Possibly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Possibly? What’s there to doubt? Have you heard her go on about her precious mother?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. But I’ve never been sure whether she loves her mother in actualised or abstract terms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  or what?” Momomi pouted. “Using big words to make yourself sound cool…  but I guess I know what you mean. It’s hard to tell whether that’s  genuine love or a love for a cause, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “It’s  difficult to know, but Olesa does not act as a child, regardless of  what she thinks of her mother. She frames herself in adult terms. She  also came here for that, and I don’t know whether or not her mother  approved of that… but it’s not my decision to make, or my place to  judge. I’m just thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “She makes everything  so damn complicated, though, doesn’t she? I don’t think she could ever  be happy merely spending time with her mother, she just has to  struggle, doesn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “Perhaps. I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re fairly cautious, aren’t you?” Momomi leaned forwards slightly. “How about you and your mother?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We get on… well,” Amane replied. “Well enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  I wish I did. Yukaho… how should I put it? She’s weak. So very weak,  that I almost hate it. No, I do think I hate her. He always just walked  over her, it wasn’t funny at all.” Momomi frowned, shaking her head  slightly. “Err, forget that. But what I mean is that I can’t quite tell  whether I hate her or love her or both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  I do know, is that I can’t think like Olesa. I can’t see her as someone  I should please or protect at all, whatever happens.” Momomi sighed.  “That’s always worried me, ever since I met Olesa. Am I worse daughter,  a worse person, because of that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  doesn’t matter, though. Provided I’m happy with myself, worrying about  things like that is pointless.” Momomi shook her head carelessly. “And  she hasn’t received anything she didn’t sign up for. It’s not  important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced at her for a moment, looking dubious. “Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  ran a hand through her hair, frowning gently at the sky. “It’s cold  out, isn’t it? It’s under these conditions that I really remember it’s  winter…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane glanced at her. “How does it make you feel?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty gloomy, I guess. Winter’s such a miserable season.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Amane shook her head. “I meant, well… everything. About your family?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “If you mean that, you should say that. Otherwise I won’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  how I feel about my family?” Momomi’s lips moved silently as she  considered a few thoughts. “That’s a pretty general question. Do you  mean anything in particular, or just overall?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, well… to be the second daughter, say. Does that bother you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really.” Momomi shrugged. “That’s just the way it is, and in any case,  I don’t want to be indebted to my parents and my station. That’s why I  fought to stay here. I want my own life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that reckless?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little. But I’ll manage. I’m myself, and I know less gifted people get  by decently. If I have inherited talent, who needs the Phareli estate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane smiled thinly. “So you’re very arrogant, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not really arrogant if that’s just the way it is,” Momomi replied  easily. “It’s the same for you, too. You more than me, in fact. You  don’t need to be the first heir, because you’re yourself. Don’t you  think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so, I might as well be both,” Amane said. “Hypothetically.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wouldn’t  that bother you, though? You’re seen as nothing but an Ohtori, and  isn’t that what you hate about your life right now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose  so,” Amane noted. She glanced at her hand. “But, for me, for all my  words, it’s an unnecessary risk. Why not accept it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  different for you, though. You aren’t revolted by your family the way I  am by my father. So much so, and him for me, that it’s better for  everyone if we don’t really interact any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not my father, no. But it’s also different for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  looked away, her eyes absent, and remained silent for a few moments.  “For an Ohtori… the heir earns everything. We’re not idle  beneficiaries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? That’s somewhat better, but still, you’re hardly earning it in true proportion to your efforts, now are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. But an upper-class guilt complex won’t feed anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Of course. I get told that a lot. But your family sounds very interesting, that’s for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  that reminds me, you wanted to see me for something important, didn’t  you?” Momomi smiled. “I’d forgotten about that. What did you want to  talk about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Amane glanced at her. “This is it, for the most part.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. No, wait, I don’t. But never mind. If this is what makes you happy, it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Family  is important, for people like us. Or perhaps just people like me.”  Amane sat, leaning against the fence and pulling up her knees. In that  position, she looked surprisingly vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled,  sitting by her. “No, you’re right. Family is important.” She placed her  hands on the grass to either side of her, looking thoughtful. “Even if  I don’t like a lot of my family, I think about them a lot. Kaname, who  barely has a family in any sense of the word, is dominated by who they  were and are, and the things they said to her. Olesa is obsessed with  her mother. And you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane Ohtori. The sum total of my being is the surname.” Amane shrugged. “That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still gloomy? I never thought I’d say this, but you have real self-esteem issues.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, whatever. For the four of us, but for different reasons, family is central to ourselves. Don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, Shion’s main concern with family is quoting her father, and  Amiki… does she even have family? Probably, but it isn’t important.  Olesa is her family.” Momomi rubbed her nose. “So not everyone worries  about it. The Etoiles do as well, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Family is probably  important to many people, but only a few worry about it. If this was a  kind world, in any case, that would be true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “You’re enthusiastic about this stuff, aren’t you? I haven’t seen you speak this eloquently in quite a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged. “This, too, is something I think about a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fair enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But if you were the owner of the Phareli head, what would you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’d  sell it all and give the money to charity-” Momomi chuckled “is what  I’d like to say. But if I think about that situation, I wouldn’t. I’d  live a good life, and probably try to make enough money to cover my  overheads.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane quirked her eyebrows. “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For my  children.” Momomi frowned. “Adopted. Presumably. But wasting all that  money on the good life just feels even more irresponsible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess I might even try to make some,” Momomi mused. “It’d be something  to do. And the traditions, by and large, I’d probably keep them. For  old time’s sake.” She touched her cheek and smiled slightly, glancing  at Amane. “A little hypocritical of me, I know, but I’m not an  idealist. <em>Every rebel becomes a conservative the day after the revolution</em>, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I suppose so. But that’s natural, not something to be ashamed of.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some  things would be different, though. I wouldn’t teach any bullshit  homophobia, for a start…” Momomi coughed. “Though I guess I’m a bit  biased on that one. But still, I won’t apologise for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “And your children?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wouldn’t let them loaf around and get used to being rich and idle,”  Momomi noted. “That’d just be stupid. I’d expect them to work very  hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How would you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’d probably send  them to a normal school. It’s a better social experience, and it’d give  them some damn perspective on life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wouldn’t their education suffer for that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hopefully not. But I could always hire tutors to supplement their learning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like your parents?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we were exclusively taught by tutors, remember.” Momomi smiled. “But if  there’s one thing I’m glad to receive from my parents, it’s my language  education. It was agonising when I was young, but there’s a lot to be  said for it. I enjoy it now, on top of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you wouldn’t send them here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well…  probably not. Though this school is pretty good for teaching a kind of  independence.” Momomi scowled. “But that’s not a given reason. I’m not  going to teach them in exactly the same ways my parents taught me, if  that’s what you’re implying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all. I’m just curious. But  don’t you think the social contacts we make here are important? Don’t  under-estimate the old school contacts we receive here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that, you don’t exactly make much use of that yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nonetheless, I’ll have contacts. I’ll expect great things of one Kiyashiki-san, for example.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flushed. “Is that a compliment? From you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nonetheless. Privilege shouldn’t just be measured in terms of education and material wealth. Contacts are just as important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Once again, your surprising thoughtfulness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.”  Amane shredded a piece of grass idly. “This was something taught me by  my family. That’s why my cousins go to the biggest private school in  the country.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I do take your point.” Momomi frowned. “Perhaps state primary school education would be best, then? I’m not sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t it better for you to stick to your guns?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  can I say? I’m not an idealist.” Momomi smirked. “I want what’s best  for my children. Everyone will say that, they just differ on what they  think the best is. But if someone shoves their child one way or the  other for pure ideology, I wouldn’t consider them a very good parent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder whether Kenjou would agree.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wonder… it’s hard to imagine Kaname and children, at all. She didn’t  exactly have the best life experiences herself.” Momomi grinned. “But I  guess she’d be very tribal and over-protective, if she ever had  children. Doesn’t seem her style, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. Not really. People can change, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, but that much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps not. And, how would you incentivise their work, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged. “Let’s see. I suppose I’d follow the lead of your family.  Divide my estate in accordance with the efforts and merits of my  children.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not my family’s way, though.” Amane closed her eyes. “Winner takes all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’d want to leave something for all my children. That’s only fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would cripple the Phareli family as an entity, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’d  destroy the Phareli family in that respect, yes.” Momomi smiled. “Who  cares? Did I ever say I was doing this for my ancestors of the family  name? I want my children to be happy, or at least deservedly miserable.  I could care less about how big we are compared to you guys, say. So  there’s no need for a single inheritance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I see… so that’s the difference. For the Ohtori, the primacy of the family is everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Case  in point, you can call them the Ohtori like that.” Momomi laughed.  “Well, I know it’s a bad thing to do on rice farms or whatever, but  this isn’t a rice farm. My children don’t need extraordinary privilege  in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane chuckled. “I see. You’re an independent-minded one, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what would you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…  don’t know.” Amane folded her arms, looking moodily at the trees. “It  doesn’t matter, though. The second cousin of the main family is a  possession to be auctioned off. I realised that eventually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  doesn’t answer the question, though. It’s hypothetical, as I’ll never  be the Phareli heir either.” Momomi smiled. “What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  shrugged. “I haven’t thought about it. To be honest, though, I think  I’d preserve the single inheritance. I can see the reason for it. But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No arranged marriages?” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. But that wasn’t it. I wouldn’t encourage… such a competitive attitude. Not as they do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing important. It hardly applies to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say that, but it’s in your head, I can tell. You drop enough hints for me to know, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not deaf, you know.” Momomi sat up, rubbing the back of her head. “Ow.  My neck hurts. Maybe that wasn’t such a good idea after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve stopped taking interest, as it doesn’t apply to me,” Amane replied testily. “It’s irrelevant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wonder. I guess that is one way to react, isn’t it? Isn’t that what you  always do? If you look away and pretend you don’t care, it’s a good way  to protect your feelings, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked away, saying  nothing, then blinked and caught herself. “Not really. Like I said,  it’s worthless for me to worry about it. No more than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  done that myself. But it’s never quite true. However hard someone  tries, they can’t stop themselves from worrying about other people, and  how they are seen to be. In my experience, the more someone feigns  disinterest the more vulnerable they are.” Momomi smiled gently. “And I  have a lot of experience. I know Kaname, after all, and she spent a  year doing that. Olesa’s another good example, and I myself used the  same methods… I can’t speak for the others, but for me it was a sad  thing. However much I walled myself up, I was still lonely and  melancholy. I wondered why no one cared, even if I swore blind I didn’t  care myself. That’s one of the reasons why Kaname’s become important to  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane sounded uncomfortable. “I can understand that. It doesn’t have anything to do with the Ohtori inheritance, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see.” Momomi looked away, still smiling lightly. “You should tell me,  you know. I can keep a secret, and it’ll make you feel better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s nothing to tell.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder. But everyone has something to tell. For me, I was kidnapped by someone I considered a friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds  unreal, doesn’t it? Well, the circumstances were very unusual.” Momomi  sighed. “That used to be the terror of my life. Before, there’s no way  I’d be able to talk so casually about that. It was something that  warped my thinking for months. But I’m better now. Compared to Kaname,  that was nothing. And still, she didn’t mind listening, even if it was  my own foolishness that caused it in the end. She didn’t mock me. And  so I was able to move on. It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Amane smiled. “You’re very forgiving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. Quite the saint, aren’t I?” Momomi grinned. “Of course, I won’t forgive some people, starting with Kaname’s parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it’s interesting, that you’re so calm about betrayal.” Amane scowled,  face twisting. “If I was in that situation, I wouldn’t forgive that  person. Never.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t make me happy. I’m still angry in my  heart. But he suffered a lot for it, too, so that’s something that  relieves me, even if it’s terrible to say that. If he wasn’t punished,  I’d feel a lot worse about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at the  blue-haired girl, who was studiously studying the clouds. “Either way,  what’s done is done. I’m glad, now, that I don’t let it control my  life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speaking hypothetically-” Amane began. Then she stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speaking hypothetically?” Momomi queried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about if it’s family that betrays you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s the case, it really is unforgivable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  Kenjou, it’s something like that, isn’t it?” Amane muttered. “You  mentioned her parents, didn’t you? That must be really bad…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled slightly. “Yeah. It is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane was silent for a while. Then she stood and brushed herself off, looking away. “I told you about dreams, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At some length.” Momomi stood as well, studying her face. “You said you didn’t have any.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right.” Amane shrugged. “It’s another defence mechanism. Dreams, like  feelings, are vulnerabilities people can exploit. If you have dreams or  are given them someone can lead you on, play on your ambitions or  feelings, then crush you totally. That’s why I admire people like you,  who have ambitions and feelings both. You live an exciting life while  remaining exquisitely vulnerable to the people around you. In the end,  you might either fly or fall. I can’t know for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you? What clipped your wings?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not important. Thank you for listening until now, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  nodded, frowning slightly. “Think nothing of it. But even if you’re  pained or scared, you should trust me. You can’t afford to pretend you  feel nothing when that’s such an obvious lie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane made an amused noise, turning away. “You’re very presumptuous, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I’m myself. But that has nothing to do with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stopped after a few steps. “I thought that, perhaps, I could tell you. But I was wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see…” Momomi frowned. “I understand. But even if you say that, there  are plenty of other people who care for you. So many. You shouldn’t be-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  pity me, Kiyashiki. I won’t forgive you for that.” Amane chuckled.  “Don’t confuse me with Kenjou or yourself. I just enjoy listening to  you talk. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m flattered,” Momomi replied casually. “For you, that’s an unusual admission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to see the horses. You should go back. Kenjou will be waiting for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Goodnight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look after her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane waved vaguely over her shoulder. “Goodnight, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, watching her go. <em>So that’s how it is…it can’t be helped, though. Sometimes, there’s nothing to do but watch.</em></span></p>
