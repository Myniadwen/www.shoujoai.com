“So, all your outfits are a year old as well?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For  me, it’s more like two years.” Kaname folded her arms. “And… to put it  charitably… they’re designed for function rather than form.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As  for me, they’re all selected by my mother or sister and getting on the  short side for my age.” Momomi sighed. “It looks like we should spend  some time on clothes shopping, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I hate that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I don’t like it either. I had servants and relatives to do those things  for me, so I’m hardly experienced. Actually, I’m almost looking  forwards to the novelty of the experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname remembered the  Momomi that fussed over her hair and straightened her necktie  compulsively. “Actually, I think you might enjoy it. I, on the other  hand, absolutely despise everything like that.” <em>Besides, it’s expensive…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  guess that’s to be expected.” Momomi shrugged on her school shirt,  which was blue enough to pass, as well as one of her skirts, which was  intended for a slightly younger girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Looks tight, and… how do I say this… a little on the short side. </em>Kaname looked away and pulled out her own clothes, dressing in a T-shirt and a grey hoodie. And trousers, thank God. <em>I’ll wear trousers whenever it’s physically possible. They’re just better in every particular, as far as I’m concerned. We</em> <em>don’t exactly match very well, but it can’t be helped. </em>Finally, she took out her purse and put it in her trouser pocket. <em>And  then there’s that consideration. Obnoxious term fees may be paid for,  but the scholarship doesn’t make much more provision than that, except  for food and breathing. And it’s not like I receive any from mother. So  I saved a couple of yen yesterday…either way, it will be a stretch just  to eat out. Forget clothes shopping. I’m damned if I’m going to admit  as much, though.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi herself shrugged on a brown coat and  picked up a certain envelope, flipping it between her fingers  awkwardly. She’d already opened it; it was a present from Yukaho, and  contained enough money to pay Kaname’s mother for a month’s full time  work. The brown-haired girl appeared acutely aware of the disparity.  “I’ll pay for everything. That’s only fair, as it’s my occasion we’re  celebrating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname scowled. “I don’t want charity, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  isn’t charity, I wouldn’t do something like that.” Momomi glared at her  friend. “You’d be a doing a favour to me, as I don’t want this money. I  don’t like anything associated with my family, so it suits me just fine  to spend it as much as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You can afford a pretty casual attitude, can’t you?” <em>I’m  being unfair, I know. It’s not like it’s Momomi’s fault that she’s born  rich, and she is trying to be sensitive. But it’s hard to resist  feeling just a little bitter.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps I can, but I’m not  changing it for you. Get used to it.” Momomi stuck the envelope in the  inside pocket of her coat. “And I’m paying, because of that, for me  rather than you. If we don’t get decent clothes soon enough, it’ll just  be embarrassing come summertime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I can buy my own clothes, thank you,” Kaname retorted unconvincingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “For God’s sake, Kaname… if I call this an early birthday present, will that help?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright. Do what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">There  was a knock at the door, which came in good time. Kaname sighed and  walked over there, opening it and glaring out. “Hi. Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Good morning. I came to apologise,” Shion explained, bowing slightly. “It looks like I can’t make today, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You can’t?” Momomi asked, moving forwards to stand besides her friend. “Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Apparently,  today’s important for that play we’re putting on. We need to get  through the paperwork and application details in preparation for the  presentation to the Etoiles. So I really need to be here helping  Tsukimi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I see. Too bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion smiled. “I’m very  annoyed, actually. I wanted to have fun with you two and the other two.  Things are always interesting when we’re all together. But I’m sure  you’ll be able to enjoy yourselves without me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, we aren’t  exactly going to be crying, no,” Kaname said coolly. “I’m sure we’ll be  able to handle the intense trauma of your absence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re still the same as ever, I see. Just in different clothes. I’m very intimidated, Kenjou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  rolled her eyes. “If you’re scared by a thirteen year-old Catholic  schoolgirl in a hoodie, you’d probably give yourself a heart-attack  just walking the streets of my home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To be fair, you’re a  pretty scary thirteen-year old schoolgirl,” Momomi pointed out.  “Shion’s scarier, of course. Just in a different way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  Kiyashiki-san can be a little worrying as well. It’s a sign of  intelligence. If people are comfortable with you, you’re probably doing  something wrong.” Shion looked up proudly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that attitude explains a lot,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  not exactly best-placed to talk, Kenjou-kun.” Shion smiled. “At least  I’m not feared because I might beat the hell out of someone at the drop  of a hat. In any case… looks like I needn’t have worried.” Shion waved.  “Have fun, you two. I’ll be going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“See you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, wait!” Momomi raised a hand. “Have you talked to Isae yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion stopped and looked back over her shoulder. “Not yet. I’m working on it.” She walked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Working  on it, my ass.” Kaname sighed and closed the door, leaning against it.  “But there’s a girl with a sense of timing. This is why I never get  involved in extra-curricular activity, stuff like this happens.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  wonder… well, I suppose she can’t spend all the time with us.” Momomi  walked over to the mirror, checking her hair and brushing an errant  lock into place. “It can be hard to tell, but I do think Shion is  important to Spica.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And she’s important to us, as well. It  sometimes feels like she has both those things to avoid having to have  actual friends her age.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I think you’re right, really.” Momomi  went and sat on her bed, stretching slightly. “It’s weird. There’s no  reason why she should be unpopular or a loner… I mean, she’s a little  weird, but that’s never stopped anyone with her confidence and  personality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s a question that can easily be applied  to us, can’t it?” Kaname sat opposite her, looking at her friend with  interest. “The answer is that we choose to live like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  just wish I knew her reason. I mean, Isae-chan’s one thing, but this  would definitely be an overreaction if it’s just from that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shion’s  Shion. Go figure.” When Momomi still looked dissatisfied Kaname  shrugged. “Well, you can ask her if you like. That’s the best way that  I can see. But she’s smart enough to be able to look after herself. We  should probably sort ourselves out before we try and lecture anyone  else about being antisocial.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right,” Momomi agreed.  “Well, that’s another thing we have to work on. This popularity thing  should be easy enough, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, Amane manages it, and she doesn’t even try. It can’t be too hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t really know where to start… maybe I’ll ask the Etoiles for tips.”  Momomi smiled. “Now there’s a pair who’ve mastered the personality  cult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Eh, let’s worry about that later. This is a day for  relaxation, right?” Kaname checked her watch and stood. “We should go  and all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded, pushing herself off the bed and slinging  her bag across her shoulders. “For carrying stuff later,” she  explained, when Kaname gave her a questioning glance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it doesn’t look too bad.” Kaname frowned. “Are we having breakfast in the canteen, or what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Isn’t it more interesting to have it in town?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname considered making another comment about money, but decided against it. <em>I  don’t want too sound too twitchy…besides, it would take a more  heartless person than me to blunt her current enthusiasm. And that’s  saying something. </em>“I guess you’re right.” She smiled. “You’re determined to get everything you can out of this, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I do have something to celebrate. Besides, a chance like this  definitely isn’t usual. To be able to skip a whole school day…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  opened the door and stepped out. “That reminds me,” she said glumly.  “How many days of school are we going to have to catch up on after  today? I mean, on top of this, there’s Friday as well, and bits and  pieces elsewhere too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m in denial about that right now. It’s  not interesting or unusual. It’s really boring instead. So I’ll worry  about that tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smiled again, looking ahead. “Right, right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  started to walk towards the gates, ignoring the strange looks of the  other students up so early. “That’s an annoying thing about this  school, though,” Momomi sighed. “It’s so large and isolated. It’ll take  us at least half an hour to actually reach the town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  nodded. “I’ve always wondered why that’s the case. This would be a  decent location for a prison, honestly. Do they have hidden cameras  everywhere and dogs that can chase down any of us that try to escape?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They’re worse than that. They have a crazy girl with a katana in a position of responsibility over us all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi’s  phone rang as they walked down the corridor. She frowned and flipped it  up. “Hello? Oh, Amiki…” She blinked. “You too? Oh, that’s… Shion came  to me to apologise as well. I… see. That’s unusual timing. Really… I  understand. Well, it’s a shame. Look after her, will you? Tell her to  get well soon… I got it. Bye.” She folded her phone up and sighed,  rolling her eyes. “Well, that’s just great.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname stared at her. “What’s up? Amiki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Apparently,  Olesa’s come down with some kind of illness. Bad food, my ass. This is  way too suspicious.” Momomi put her phone back into her jacket pocket.  “And of course Amiki has to stay and tend to her sickly ojou-sama like  a good servant. What a bizarre pair they are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, don’t be too surprised. She is paid for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ve probably said this before, but Amiki looks like the type who’d live this way even if she wasn’t paid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  shrugged. “I guess so. I used to think that was completely stupid, but  now I think I know where she’s coming from. Just a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  looked away. “I know what you mean. And I’ve always wondered… what’s  Olesa like, when it’s just them? I do wonder at her personality when  she’s alone with Amiki, and she can finally be herself, dropping her  damn robotic persona.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We probably won’t ever know, unless we  bug their room,” Kaname observed. “She’s way too proud to ever lower  her guard around us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled at her friend. “A little familiar, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“At least we never changed ourselves as a defence mechanism, to shut everyone out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Actually,  I think we did exactly that, and even now, we’re a little defensive. I  don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing, but it won’t work now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The more you say that, the scarier you make it sound,” Kaname replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, those two are probably curled up in their room, playing  Starcraft, and we’ve been left in the lurch.” Momomi sighed. “This  stinks of a conspiracy, through and through.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a pretty  pointless conspiracy,” Kaname said. “It’s not like we’re not going to  go, or anything. We’ll just have to manage like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi gave her a sidelong glance. “I guess you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  stepped out onto the grass, looking round. The sun was bright but low  in the sky, slanting light through the trees and into Kaname’s eyes  without providing much in the way of warmth. <em>Crisp is the most charitable way to describe this morning. But it’s a little pretty, all the same. </em>“Do you want around and see your family off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not particularly. I’m a little afraid to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey,  you shouldn’t be intimidated by what your father said,” Kaname said,  glancing at her friend. “Isn’t better to challenge him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There’s  nothing to gain. I know what I’d see and hear.” Momomi stuck her hands  in the pockets of her coat, looking glum. “I’d rather not see him being  the bastard he is, shouting at everyone and everything else. If I leave  now and don’t see that, I can pretend that the more reasonable man is  my father instead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That doesn’t sound very honest.” Kaname  shrugged. “Well, he’s your father, your business. But I still have that  promise to keep… it’s a little unfortunate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you talking about? Tell me already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You don’t remember? I’m slightly offended.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  pushed her friend playfully. “If you don’t stop talking around the  subject and elaborate, I’ll definitely punish you somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged casually. “It looks like I’ll have to be punished, then. It’s not something I can afford to tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then  I won’t hold back.” Momomi struck a dramatic poise, pointing playfully  up at her friend’s face. “I’ll drag you to every clothes store in town  and make you suffer horribly!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname winced. “You’re as cruel as ever, aren’t you? That’s just too harsh…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, there <em>is </em>an easy way out, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s tempting. No, I must be brave, and not allow myself to succumb to your vile threats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted at her. “We’ll see if you’re still saying that after the hundredth outfit?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The hundredth? How much money are you going to spend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  look at lots of things, and put them on, and pay for only a few of  them,” Momomi explained facetiously. “I think that’s what sis said  about the process.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If only that worked at restaurants…” Kaname mused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, however you look at it, I don’t think they want their products back once you’ve tried them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Really? Never stopped anyone from my hometown.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled. “That’s not funny in itself, but you sound almost proud when you say that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps  it’s just a cultural thing,” Kaname deadpanned, “but it’s never felt  like a real meal out to me if you don’t get smashed and throw up.  That’s why I don’t eat out, ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I know the feeling. I  was raised under the strict understanding that less food is better, and  so more expensive, and if you were full something had gone wrong  somewhere.” Momomi tucked a strand of brown hair out of her eyes. “So  it’s probably best if we keep those preconceptions out of the way,  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They began the trek down Astraea Hill,  chatting away happily. Kaname looked around in a momentary lull,  enjoying the feel of a cool wind running through her hair. <em>It’s  something I’ve noticed, but our conversations always seem to move  sideways. Wherever we’ve started, we’ll always end up somewhere else  completely, often within a few seconds. And we rarely run out of things  to say, which is bizarre in itself because we do almost everything  together. It’s not like we have the time to accumulate experiences  apart and exchange them. But even more than that quality, we don’t have  awkward silences. Even when we’re not talking, it’s comfortable, and  it’s enjoyable for me just to be in Momomi’s presence. I’m not sure  why, but that’s just the way it is. I can’t say it’s something I’ve  ever felt before. </em>She slid her eyes sideways, smiling slightly. <em>And  that’s something I’ve noticed. The one strand of hair that keeps  falling into her eyes, so she keeps brushing it away, with a quick  touch of her fingers. It’s strangely interesting to watch, because it  has that nebulous quality… what was that Greek guy? He kept having to  push a boulder up a hill, only for it to roll down again. That guy.  Now, I’ve always wondered why on earth he kept trying when the sensible  thing would be to tell Hades to drop dead and stop working. But I  wouldn’t say that with Momomi, even though her own exertions are  equally futile. Unlike an ugly, sweaty man struggling under the heat of  an undying sun, Momomi’s gentle touch on a winter day is an interesting  thing to watch. Continual effort can be worthwhile to watch, if the  process itself is interesting. In other words, it’s really kinda cute.  Just like a kid struggling with their fringe. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you staring at?” Momomi demanded, pouting slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing in particular,” Kaname replied innocently. “Don’t mind me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled again. “Hmm. Well, if really do find me irresistible I guess looking can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, you-” Kaname paused for a moment. <em>Wait, cute? Well, isn’t that almost the same thing? </em>“Don’t say such stupid things,” she mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi prodded her on the arm again. “You’re way too defensive, just like always. Aren’t I allowed to tease you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I get more than enough of that from Amiki. Don’t you start now.” Kaname looked away, lost in thought.<em> Well, I meant cute like a child, of course. And I’m not into children  so it’s nothing like that. It’s just funny and restful, that’s all. It  doesn’t help when people make all these weird accusations.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright. Too close to the mark, I suppose. Sorry.” Momomi smirked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re way too playful today,” Kaname sighed. “But that reminds me… I was meaning to ask you. Is your cute girl Olesa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">This time, Momomi gave her an annoyed look. “Say what? Don’t just make random guesses about that! It’s a secret, I told you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  you’ve taken a lot of interest in her, and you’re anxious to get  through to her,” Kaname pointed out. “Considering you’re both pretty  alike, I was wondering whether she might be the one. You might end up  with Amiki as a rival, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now who’s misinterpreting a  perfectly innocent thing…” Momomi sighed. “Well, you’re completely  wrong. You’re not very good at this, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname just shrugged. “Well, I’m not very experienced, but I’m still interested. Is it someone I know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi folded her arms. “No guessing and no clues! If I ever do tell you, it won’t be now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Bah. Alright, I’ll just keep guessing inside my head…” Kaname looked into the forest surrounding them. <em>I’m  a little disappointed, because it would be nice to be the first to know  at a time like this. But I guess she’s keeping her cards close to her  chest, even with me. Well, she’s also woefully inexperienced, so it’s  hardly surprising. </em>She frowned. “Just as long as you don’t start writing poetry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi gave her friend an annoyed look. “Hey, I’m not a lovesick dolt, you know. I’d never do something that embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  ended up at Astraea Lake’s true front gates, which were actually wide  open. Kaname was almost surprised by that. “Looks like this place isn’t  a prison after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, when we think about it… did we ever actually go and <em>look </em>at whether we could just walk out?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  frowned. “Ah, I get it. We don’t need to be imprisoned physically if  we’re imprisoned mentally, right? The narrow thought they encourage  prevents us from looking too hard for a way to go outside.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  actually, I was referring to the fact that we’re lazy, apathetic  bastards.” Momomi shrugged. “I guess your way works too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh.”  Kaname decided to shut up and carry on walking. She looked around at  the suddenly open panorama. “When I look at it, though, I’m still  getting a weird feeling. In Astraea you’re always surrounded by forest,  whichever way you look, it limits your horizons. But out here there’s  nothing like that, and you can see a long way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For now, anyway.  When we get to town, it’ll be just as confined as before.” Momomi  yawned. “At the expense of sounding too philosophical early in the  morning, I’ve always found it interesting how humans always seem to  narrow their environments like that. When you think about it, you could  have a pretty large tract of land for each and every human on earth,  even now. Of course, things aren’t that simple, but we still congregate  above and beyond our strict need.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s just basic fear,  isn’t it? Safety in numbers… a basic tenet of survival, right? When  we’re afraid, we seek company, which makes us feel less afraid. It’s  hardwired into our instincts to act that way, fear’s a motive force and  not even a weapon will reassure us more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled. “It’s  very… Kaname, to bring it down to that. And here I was thinking it was  the social instinct of humanity. No man is an island, and such  beautiful things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No one rule can describe all of man. That’s  the way I see it. But…” Kaname looked around. “Even though there are  plenty of material reasons, and the social aspect as well, I think  there’s something to be said for the fear of empty spaces. When we  clump and build towers we can pretend we’re not so dwarfed by the sky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  moaned and rubbed the side of the head. “God, this is too early in the  morning for philosophy. I’m sorry I ever raised the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Can’t keep up, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No,  I’m fine. You’re talking in such a blunt way as ever, Kaname.” Momomi  smiled. “But I’m always impressed when you get like this. You don’t act  like it, but you can actually think pretty deeply.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t be too surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course, it’s hard to tell when you’re around people…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. Whatever.” Kaname looked away. “I wouldn’t waste my time talking like this with normal people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  giggled. “Is that a compliment? Well, I’m no different, I suppose. I’m  always afraid and a little embarrassed to talk like this, but it’s easy  with you. I suppose that’s trust.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname blushed. “That’s probably misplaced,” she mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Probably,” Momomi agreed easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. <em>She’s  far more distracting than Astraea’s trees, so that I completely lose  sight of the horizon I was marvelling at a moment ago when she’s  talking, or even when she’s just by my side. That would be the social  instinct she was talking about. I used to be so proud of being alone…so  much for those days. And I’m at the town before I know it, which  definitely limits my horizons. We should just sit in silence at some  point, isn’t that more soothing? Well, we do that all the time anyway,  I suppose, but this is new, and I’m not actually very keen on new  things.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What do you want for breakfast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname considered. <em>Something cheap? I hate having to think like that…</em>”How  about something simple, Japanese style? I’m so spoiled on their varied  breakfasts at Astraea I’d give quite a lot for traditional food.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted. “Do we have to? Too much fish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  laughed. “Of course, I’d forgotten. If you plan on living here, Momomi,  you’d better get used to fish. It’s a staple of our diet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  think I don’t know that? This is the modern world, damnit, I don’t have  to eat fish! There’s plenty of other stuff to eat, even Japanese  style.” Momomi gave her an annoyed look. “It’s a family thing, alright?  It’s not like I’m picky or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ve noticed. I’m still  amazed you want to go native on me, though. You don’t exactly match any  of our supposed cultural characteristics.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, do you? Aren’t girls supposed to be quiet and retiring, or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  no, but that’s always the way. It’s a generation gap, right? That’s the  way it always goes, so I suppose they’ll just have to get used to you  as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “Well, you hardly need to tell me about a generation gap…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, I don’t suppose we’d get Italian food here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Can’t stand it for breakfast anyway. Way too light.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“English?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are we going to find that very easily in a town like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “Alright, alright. Japanese, and we can play the swapping game.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think they serve umeboshi for breakfast, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know. That’s why I’m sacrificing myself, but it’s your celebration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “Well, what choice do we have? I’ll go with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Okay. Just don’t do it- like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi wrinkled her brow. “Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname tried to sound angry rather than embarrassed. “Not in a flirty way, that’s all I’m saying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked. “We’ll, I’ll be the one feeding you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s just what I mean!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  be too loud, that’s even worse.” Momomi smirked. “The way you’re  looking right now, any casual passer-by would think you had something  to hide.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright. I got it. Kaname  won’t show her affections in public, because she’s a responsible and  straight-laced girl… yeah, that’s consistent…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s only sensible,” Kaname replied defensively. “Even for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “I don’t know why you care so much, but whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked around. “Of course, I’ve no idea where to find a decent restaurant around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is the problem with such short notice,” Momomi mused. “We have to plan in your style, which is to say, not at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you, it’s not like I don’t plan. I made a lot of plans for the whole deal with your father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“None of which we used.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah,  well, I also appreciate the necessity of occasional spontaneity.  Thinking you can plan for anything is a fallacy, you definitely need to  stay flexible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi closed her eyes. “I appreciate that, and  perhaps my words were ill-chosen. But are you seriously telling me that  there’s necessary spontaneity in knowing where to eat? I should have  taken a look at a map, at least…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That would have been boring,” Kaname observed. “We can just walk around randomly and see what we find.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  sighed and opened her eyes, looking round as well. “You’re right, of  course, we don’t have any other option. Well, we could ask someone-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why not? Doesn’t that make more sense than wandering in circles hoping to run into one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s really annoying when people do that without even trying,” Kaname said. “It should be an absolute last resort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi gave her friend a critical look. “You’re very… male, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, thanks for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not necessarily an insult. But you do essay a lot of stereotypically male opinions, and this is definitely one of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Whatever.  It’s hardly a deep thing, I just find it annoying to ask people for  help.” Kaname folded her arms. “Come on, at least go through the  motions of independent action before begging someone else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  sighed. “This is why Shion bunking off on us is so annoying. She’d  definitely have known where we could get a decent breakfast. More than  that, she’d have a comparison chart in her head, with the star ratings  all looked up and cross-referenced across multiple sources and a dozen  customer accounts for each, along with a precise address.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re getting very dependent on her for information, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I could do what she does myself, but it doesn’t interest me.” Momomi  shrugged. “I’ll admit, I wouldn’t mind reading her files, though.  Information is power, it's not just a quaint platitude. That’s why she  does it. I’d enjoy stealing it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “Well, that’s all well and good. But it won’t find us a restaurant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It  took twenty minutes and a lot of argument before they were finally  seated in a small, fairly informal-looking place, ordering the standard  breakfast. Kaname was relieved to see that it was within her budget,  but it didn’t make her comfortable, either. <em>It’s a difficult  situation. While it’s nice I wouldn’t do this out of choice, but I  can’t tell her that, either. I have my pride. And she does deserve a  decent celebration, even if it’s just me and her. So I don’t really  have any choice…being proud and good both is definitely going to  swallow my wallet whole.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you’re from the school on the hill, right?” the owner asked in a friendly way, pottering about and seeing to their order.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rolled her eyes. <em>No, we’re from Americaland, here to steal all your robots. Where else do you get teenage girls in a dump like this?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s right,” Momomi said. “It’s to get out for a change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We don’t see many of you on schooldays. It’s a little surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Thanks  for the contribution, but isn’t that obvious? I mean, he’ll be telling  us that our demographics appear to disproportionately represent the  homosexually orientated next…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s special permission, as I have something to celebrate. The Etoiles fixed it up for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, of course… I hear a lot about them. They’ve come here once or twice, as well. Very striking girls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Now  that’s an understatement. I pity you, though, if you tried to meet  Kariya’s exacting standards. No doubt she didn’t tip you, not that I  blame her. You probably interrupted her romantic date with her  girlfriend with all your banal chatter.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They’re quite outstanding. Well, that’s why they have the position, of course. So I guess it’s to expected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  definitely unusual to meet people like them. The foreign girl and her  extremely formidable friend… that’s why I like living here. You see  interesting things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>So we’re a zoo, now, aren’t we? I love the way he talks about the “foreign girl” to the half-Italian…</em>Kaname looked around. They were almost the only people there, sadly. <em>Which  sounded like a great idea at the time but is looking increasingly  dubious now. Will this guy ever shut up? We’re here for the food, not  the conversation, which is just as well because you’d have to pay me  before I voluntarily sat through this!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re a very international school,” Momomi said diplomatically. “It’s a good experience for us, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  here you are. And I threw in two extra servings of rice, on the house.  Enjoy.” He smiled and retreated behind the counter again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why, thank you. That’s very kind of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname glared. <em>And  you can tell he knows that we’re all fricking loaded, which is true  enough…well, for everyone except me. Don’t expect me to be the naïve,  rich type, and I won’t let Momomi be stupid either, even though she can  afford it. It’s the principle of the thing that matters.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  split her chopsticks, looking across the table at her friend. “Don’t  look too gloomy, already. Is my company that arduous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked back at her. “Well, not really. I was just thinking…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve  got all the time in the world to think when we’re cooped up in our  room, but chances like this only come once in a blue moon. So let’s  enjoy our time here, okay? Even if it is only the two of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname nodded. “Sure.” She raised her own chopsticks. “All things considered, it’s almost more fun this way anyway.”</span></p>
