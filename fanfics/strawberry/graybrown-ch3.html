Miyuki looks up in surprise. It is only lunch so she is not expecting to 
find Tamao in the Student Council Room.

&quot;I know you&#39;re busy, Rokuj?-sama, but I was wondering if I could bother 
you with something...&quot;

Miyuki tilts her head to the side. She and Tamao have grown considerably 
more comfortable with each other over the past weeks, so she finds the 
younger girl&#39;s sudden shyness intriguing.

&quot;Of course, Tamao-san. You know that I would be glad to help you with 
anything.&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; The younger girl hesitates. &quot;It&#39;s just that I haven&#39;t been 
able to write poetry...lately, so I&#39;ve tried my hand at something else. 
I really admired the critique you did of my adaptation of Carmen, so I 
was wondering if I could impose on you to do more of the same with this 
new work I&#39;m trying...&quot;

Miyuki looks at the slim notebook in Tamao&#39;s outstretched hands and 
accepts it with a smile.

&quot;I would be honored, Tamao-san. I know how highly regarded your literary 
work is in Astraea Hill. Are you sure you&#39;d want to risk the originality 
of your work by paying attention to editorial criticisms from me?&quot;

Tamao answers simply and candidly.

&quot;Rokuj?-sama, I would consider my work incomplete without your comments. 
Please feel free to be as harsh as necessary. I would greatly appreciate 
your honest opinion.&quot;

With that, Tamao bows and leaves the room. Miyuki is left staring at the 
bound volume in her hands. With some anticipation, she turns the first 
page.

~~~~~

I knew, someday, it would come to this. I&#39;d only hoped it would come 
much later. She was mine for too short a time. But I deceive myself. She 
was never mine. She was another&#39;s the moment another claimed her with a 
kiss.  Everything else that&#39;s happened since then has only delayed the 
inevitable. Now the inevitable has happened. But I find no consolation 
in my foresight, just an immense sense of loss and desolation. If 
friendship means desiring the happiness of the other, then I want no 
part of friendship. I have only ever known the pain of loving, never the 
joy. Of what use are my gifts to me, when she only loves another?

Pain twists Miyuki&#39;s heart as she turns the pages of Tamao&#39;s notebook. 
Tamao had written an elegy. For herself, and for Miyuki, whether she had 
intended the latter or not.  Grief overcomes the older woman as Tamao&#39;s 
retelling of her loss forces her to relive hers. Miyuki closes her eyes 
and thinks with despair. It never ends. Not in Strawberry House.

~~~~~

It had been inevitable really, her falling for Shizuma. Shizuma 
exercised a near terminal attraction on nearly everyone who encountered 
her. She was wild, beautiful, headstrong and free - a feral creature 
turned loose in the bland domesticity of Strawberry House. As for 
Miyuki, she had been a delicate and withdrawn child, raised with rigor 
but no affection. And so when both girls had been assigned the same room 
in their first year in Astraea Hill, the stage was set for a tragedy so 
obvious it was nearly comic. It would take years for Miyuki to learn to 
even construct a haphazard defense for her battered psyche. Faced with 
filial and romantic rejection, she learned to find solace in the one 
thing she could control: the fulfillment of duty. If a side of her ever 
existed that craved for love and affection, no visible trace of it 
remained. At least on the surface.

~~~~~

&quot;Tamao-san.&quot;

Tamao shades her eyes and blinks up at the figure before her. Despite 
the cold, she is seated on the ground, leaning against her favorite 
tree, the requisite pen and paper in hand. She no longer expects her 
poetry to come to her these days, but finds the ritual oddly comforting.

&quot;Rokuj?-sama?&quot;

The older woman hesitates, then asks.

&quot;May I join you here, or am I disturbing you?&quot;

It is Tamao&#39;s turn to be surprised by her mentor&#39;s hesitation. She 
shakes her head in answer and shifts slightly to make room for Miyuki by 
the tree.

&quot;Not at all, Rokuj?-sama. I&#39;m always glad to have your company.&quot;

This statement of affection, said so artlessly and seriously, brings a 
smile to Miyuki&#39;s face. She gazes at the younger girl and speaks without 
thinking.

&quot;You&#39;re very sweet, Tamao-san. I&#39;m really glad that we got the chance to 
know each other better.&quot;

Tamao looks away, embarrassed. The warmth on her cheeks tells her that 
she is blushing. When she looks back at the older woman, Miyuki is 
gazing out into the frozen lake, fingers tracing an outline on her neck 
in the by-now-familiar gesture.

&quot;Forgive me, Tamao-san. But I don&#39;t think I can give you a proper 
critique of the work you lent me the other day.&quot;

Tamao does not conceal her disappointment.

&quot;But why Rokuj?-sama? Is it that bad? Or perhaps your duties don&#39;t leave 
you much free time?&quot;

Miyuki shakes her head to silence the other girl.

&quot;It&#39;s not those things, Tamao-san. It&#39;s just that what you&#39;ve 
written...&quot; Miyuki hesitates, then tries again. &quot;Perhaps the best way to 
put it is to say that I don&#39;t have the required aesthetic distance.&quot;

This time, when they look at each other, neither turns away. Gray eyes 
meet brown ones in a look of shared pain and compassion. Tamao nods, 
deeply touched by the older woman&#39;s admission of what is obviously an 
intensely private grief.

&quot;I understand, Rokuj?-sama.&quot;

They continue sitting by the lake until early evening.</pre>
