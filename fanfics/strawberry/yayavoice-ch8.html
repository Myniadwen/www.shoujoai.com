<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Filler: Rin : A Fan-Club huh?</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  other girls have been bothering me about this for weeks… It’s  about my classmate, Nanto Yaya… Former Choir Ace, a bit of a  troublemaker but an especially good friend to have. Or at least so  I’ve heard. She’s been my classmate since I entered Spica, so  that’s probably about two and a half years by now. We don’t  really talk much; though I’m quite sure she tried to befriend me  once last year. Unfortunately I was pretty much not talking to anyone  at the time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anyway  a lot of girls who have started to like her have been starting to  meet. Sharing encounter stories with Nanto-san, any rumors  surrounding her, a great collection of pictures nude and non-nude a  like and even articles that she had touched. I recall someone  auctioning her hair and made a small fortune. After all that I  thought they’d be satisfied. But unfortunately it seems that they  want the girl to recognize them. And I happened to suggest to them  about forming a club and having it acknowledged by her. It happened  like this…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">About  two months ago… Sakura, my… uh... friend and junior had been  infatuated with Nanto Yaya. I don’t exactly know when she started  liking her. But I do know she’s been awfully obsessed… I mean  she’s bought quite a few pictures of her and she did buy a swimsuit  and a few articles of clothes that the girl had sold because it  didn’t fit her anymore. When I asked about it before, Sakura said  that she liked the clothes not who wore it before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anyway  Sakura’s interest and admiration has been growing quite steadily  and me, being the Nanto-san’s classmate, instantly elected me a  position to get information and things that Nanto-san has used and  left. At first I didn’t really understand her obsession. And just  to satisfy her I gave her small random things like a crumpled piece  of paper, a broken pencil and even a string, then claim that  Nanto-san had used them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was easy and not the least bit troublesome… to me or Nanto-san. But  after I saw Sakura’s happy face, holding fake Nanto Yaya touched  items… I felt bad and went after something I’m sure Sakura would  forgive me if I gave it to her. And that was a few strands of  Nanto-san’s hair. It was hard task… I had tried almost anything  to get me some of her hair. But in the end I ended up just asking her  for it… And the surprising thing was she gave it to me barely  asking why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  Sakura was surprised when I handed to her a small bundle of about 3  inch long raven black hair. But not as surprised when she learns that  the next day that the girl had cut her hair a few inches short.  Sakura traded a few strands of that hair to collect pictures and  items of Nanto-san’s. She was pretty satisfied after that. She knew  nothing could beat owning a part of Nanto-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a while she and other girls formed a fan club. Sure they were  informal and unknown to the one they were worshiping… but they  seemed happy. I hear that they would go to all her recitals… relay  anything new about her and the likes. I’m surprised that Nanto-san  hasn’t noticed. That or she doesn’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  after a while they seemed to want more. One night Sakura told me  about their club’s depression that began to escalate since  Nanto-san had stopped coming to choir practice. I jokingly told her  that they should just confront Nanto-san and get her acknowledgement  that they had a fan club dedicated to her, so that they could worship  and watch her closely like Ootori’s and Hanazono’s fan clubs do.  It was supposed to be a joke, or at least a half assed suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unfortunately  Sakura didn’t see it that way. She had told the other members of  the club that they should do that. And unfortunately the one who had  to ask was… me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  asked them why. I expected that they would say some stupid reason  about it being my suggestion so I had to do it. But instead I got  begging and something about me being the only person they know close  enough to Nanto-san. Also something about since I wasn’t a fan I  didn’t have to worry about revealing myself when Nanto-san  declines. Which made sense, if they were discovered they would have a  harder time stalking her wouldn’t they?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  agreed after some convincing… but to too a while for me to actually  get the chance too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  that chance came a Thursday afternoon. Some girls had spotted her and  her best friend heading to the cafeteria for lunch. Myself, Sakura  and Ilya followed them and saw them in line. We ordered our food  almost before the two friends could. Actually… only Konohana-san  ordered, while Nanto-san too her time deciding what to eat. Since we  had ordered we’d only look suspicious if we stayed standing, so we  headed for a table where a few of Sakura’s friends have already  gathered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  almost aborted the plan, until I soon realized that the girl that sat  behind me on the other table was Konohana-san. Ilya and Sakura  talked, about Nanto-san… even dragging me to the conversation,  something about a hickey on Nanto-san. I could have sworn I heard  Konohana-san jump of her seat just a tad bit when she heard it. It  took a while before Nanto-san came with her tray of food. I almost  laughed when I heard the blonde girl, jerk and scream in surprise  when her best friend touched her shoulder and claimed to be out of  it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girls including Sakura, then began pleading me to ask Nanto-san now.  I delayed it for a bit, making some excuse about wanting to finish my  food… but I wanted Nanto-san to eat a bit, she looked like she  needed it. I mean everyone has notice how thinner she’s getting.  But after a few minutes the girls just wont let me be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  stood up and walked to Nanto-san. I brought out my most polite smile,  even though the people I am about to greet are my classmates... I  just felt the need to appear extra nice and proper to ask this  question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  Afternoon! Nanto-san. Konohana-san.” I greeted them. Making sure I  called them by their family names. I wouldn’t want to start making  it look like we are close or anything. I’m quite sure Sakura and  the damn group of fan girls would start bothering me even more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blonde girl was the first to look up and greet me. “Good Afternoon!  Tousaka-san.” she said with a smile. But there was this great  feeling of dread and anxiety around her. Which made me wonder if the  girl was starting to have feelings for her best friend, while still  seeing the one girl most of Spica would do almost anything to give  them the time of day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  turned to Nanto-san, she smiled and waved at me. I don’t know why  but I felt a bit warm… I must be nervous too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pardon  me asking Nanto-san, a lot of girls have been wondering about this  lately…” realized that my hands were shaking a bit when my mind  noted that my eyes were in deep contact with hers. I tried to keep  calm and level headed. I can’t back out of this now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  wanted me to ask you too… Um… too…” I was really nervous. Why  did it have to be me?!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  coughed lightly into my closed fist to clear my throat. “Would it  be alright… if some girls form a Fan Club for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘There  I finally said it!’ I looked at Nanto-san… she didn’t look too  surprised by the question. In fact she appeared quite calm. Which  ticked me off a bit… of course I wasn’t stupid enough to show  that I was…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  blinked curiously at me a few times, before flipping open her  notebook and wrote something. She then shows me her message, which  turned out to be a question. I sort of expected what she would ask.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>“<em>Do  I have to do anything?” </em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  smiled as I read it, happy that I was right in guessing her question.  It seemed honest, you can’t really expect someone to know what to  do when asked what I just did. I shook my head for her and told her:  “The only thing we need you to do is recognize it as your Fan  Club.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  seemed to be thinking about it for a moment. Actually I could  careless what the answer is… I just want it over with. She smiled  then shrugged her shoulders very slightly that you’d hardly notice  it. She then wrote: <em><u>“If  that’s all, I guess… It wouldn’t really hurt would it…”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  read it and smiled. <em>‘Finally  it’s over.’</em> Turned to  the girls around us… apparently most of the tables around  Konohana-san and Nanto-san are occupied by her Fan Club. With a voice  large enough I told the girls: <strong>“Well  girls you can worship her all you want now!”</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  caused a lot of girls to scream for joy. About half a classroom’s  worth of girls rushed from their tables and converged around the  table that the two best friends were occupying. They began to happily  complement their “idol”, praising and squealing for joy, happy to  be within 10 feet of the raven haired girl. I was actually a bit  jealous of her. <em>‘A tiny  bit…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  poor girl was a bit overwhelmed by the great number. I suppose she  was not expecting them to actually wait for their answer. Maybe I  should tell her that this is only half of the lowerclassmen  members... in Spica. She’d probably flip if she learned that she at  least had more than two classes worth of fans from the other schools  too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anyway  her fans were getting out of hand. The girl was mute now… how can  they just throw question after question at her. Really these girls…  it’s amazing how quickly manners fly away when it’s most needed.  It was then that a girl spoke up… and not just any girl. It was  Konohana, Hikari-san. She had said something… which I didn’t  catch. But it was enough to provoke a mob of fan girls. I was glad I  had moved away as soon as the girls began converging on their table.  I wouldn’t want to get caught in any cat fights…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  could hear them yelling quite angrily… saying things like.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  are you to tell us that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t  you the one who’s always bothering Yaya-sama!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you know?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And…  “You don’t deserve Yaya-onee-sama’s attention!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  saw Konohana’s face. She looked like she was going to cry… I  regret not just making the stupid suggestion now… I even regret  doing it. I felt partially responsible for what the girl was going  thru. The rage of Fan Girls can’t be underestimated I guess.  Feeling responsible for her torment, I decided that the right thing  to do was help her out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  before I could do anything a loud banging was heard echoing in the  whole cafeteria… All the girls around the two best friends, backed  away in fear and surprise. In the middle I saw… Nanto-san, with her  hands on the table. She had her eyes closed. I could tell from the  way her lip curled that she was clenching her teeth together, to  probably hold back the desire to yell at everyone. I could feel her  aura; her anger was like burning ice. It almost felt like mana though  it was too faint for a mage, but I suppose she had developed it  somehow. And although I can see and sense calmness from her, I know  she is angry. And I have to admit… quite scary. Even Konohana-san  looked terrified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girls around them stayed quiet, while shivering in fear. I just hope  that they learn the first thing anyone should know about Nanto-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a few minutes, Nanto-san lets out a big disappointed sigh. Her angry  face had held the scariest expression I’ve ever seen in my years  changed to disappointment. I watched her pick up her notebook and  step away from her seat. She walked over near Konohana-san and takes  her hand. The blonde girl was confused when the raven haired girl  gestured that they leave immediately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t  you going too…” Konohana-san was probably going to ask if her  friend wanted to at least eat the rest of her food but never did get  a chance to finish. Her best friend just shakes her head tugs her  hand lightly to make her follow. We watched the two girls leave. None  of the Fan Girls dared to stop them, nor start apologizing. Which I  think was a good thing for now. I don’t think she would have  accepted their apology just yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  soon as the girls were gone the cafeteria slowly began to return to  get noisy from all the girls resuming their conversations, except for  a small part of the fan girls namely Sakura and a few other girls. I  decided to get back to eating my meal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sakura  and the other girls then began talking. The one who started the  conversation didn’t sound like a fan. Or at least not one that knew  Nanto-san well enough. Saying: “What happened?... Why did she get  so mad?” I wanted to answer her… maybe later… They pondered  about it for a while… Sakura kept her mouth shut the whole time,  probably unsure if she should tell them that their treatment of their  “idol’s” best friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should apologize...” I said before taking another bite out of my  meal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  right. If we go talk to Yaya-sama and apologize now she might forgive  us.” said one girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  might… or might not…” that just slipped out. It seems I have a  loose tongue… I have to remedy that or more instances of me making  stupid suggestions and paying for it would happen in the future.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you mean? Rin-sempai?” asked another girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  felt like toying with their heads for a bit. So I carelessly said:  “If you’re a Nanto-san’s Fan you should know what great wrong  you just did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  are! But we don’t. Would you please tell us?” as soon as the girl  said that, the other girls began asking me the same thing. Oddly I  expected them to get angry and make a scene like they did with  Konohana-san. I thought about it a bit. Giving them the answer might  not help them much… well not their IQ anyway. But after a moment or  two I decided to just spill it. Let them decide for themselves and  get back to class. And maybe apologize myself for getting the two  into this mess. But before I could say anything…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari-sempai…  is Yaya-sama’s important person.” Sakura uttered meekly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girls looked shocked realizing for themselves what they had done to  cause their idol’s anger. They were silent for a while, which gave  me time to ponder on Konohana-san’s importance to Nanto-san. It’s  not obvious but if you look deep enough and ponder on it too much,  people would get the opinion that the raven haired girl is in love  with her own best friend. I have to admire how well she had kept it  though. Keeping their friendship so close where she could even joke  about the blonde girl being hers without the other taking it  seriously enough to even think it might be true.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then took the time to advice them on what to do. I told them that  they should apologize to Konohana-san before apologizing to  Nanto-san. I explained that if even if they apologize to Nanto-san,  the probability that she’d forgive them is very low. If  Konohana-san forgives them their chances of being forgiven would  greatly increase.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was surprised on how little effort on my part managed to convince  them to apologize. They were soon talking about where to meet up  after classes, where they could find Konohana-san and apologize. I  then returned to class and leave them to fend for themselves now...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Back  in class I had found it very difficult to keep myself from laughing  at Nanto-san’s growling stomach, especially since you’d hear a  chuckle or snicker somewhere around the class each time her stomach  made an impression of an angry animal. I took the time our teacher  used to tease Nanto-san about her loud empty belly to look at  Konohana-san, who looked concerned and a bit guilty… but I think  she’s happy as well. I kind of envy this girl for she has such a  cool friend. While I’m stuck with girls who apparently cant go a  day without seeing their idols…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  classes, I had decided to talk to Nanto-san. I waited her best friend  to separated from her before approaching her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanto-san…”  I called.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  turned to me, I expected her to be angry at me for putting her and  her best friend in the situation earlier. But instead she just smiled  and waved before opening her notebook and writing: <em><u>“Ah!  Tousaka-san want to join me for some snacks?”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Umm…  sure.” I nodded and followed her to the cafeteria. I found it funny  that this girl betrays almost all of my expectations. I thought for  sure, she would call me by my given name just then or be angry at me.  But then again this could all be a ploy. You can never guess how  dangerous people like this girl can be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  ordered a few sandwiches and some juice while I got myself some tea.  We occupied a table somewhere in the corner. I don’t understand why  she wanted to sit so far out of sight though. But better get it over  with…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanto-san.  I would like to apologize for what I had put you and your best friend  thru earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  opened her notebook again and flipped to a page revealing a big <em><u>“OK!”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?!  That’s it? You forgive me?” I asked loudly in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  just nodded and made a small hand gesture representing her response  before digging into her food.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself scratching my head. It was all too easy… so easy it  was giving me a headache. I began telling what caused me to ask her  to acknowledge her fan club just for the sake of telling her. She  just quietly ate and paid attention to what I said. I could tell that  she was a good listener. And could almost say that she was quite  aware she had a fan club. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned  today about Nanto-san… is that she’s more surprising than a fire  ball spell. After I was done talking she wrote in response; that my  action was only a catalyst to the event earlier. I was not completely  at fault for causing it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  that we just talked. Well I did most of the talking, but you’d be  surprised to learn that Nanto-san wrote pretty fast. And again I was  surprised to learn that the girl had some interest in topics I like…  namely sorcery. Even though what she had read were only the things  that non-mage families can read our conversation was… interesting.  I had fun sharing facts and stories that are usually only known by  and told to mages.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was beginning to get late. We were engrossed by our conversation that  I found myself late to head for my own club. But then again at this  point going there wouldn’t really serve any purpose. It’s not  like I can’t skip attending once in a while. But Nanto-san seemed  to have plans… she stood and cleaned up the utensils and dish that  she used and turns them in to dishwasher. She then says her goodbye  thru her notebook. It was a prewritten goodbye… It was written in  big letters and held most of the page. Just like the OK not so long  ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  gave her my goodbyes and watched her leave the cafeteria. It was too  bad really… I was really starting to like her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><u><strong>End  of Filler Story 2</strong></u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  note: Coincidentally… I had begun writing this filler chapter in  Tousaka Rin’s point of view even before Ichimaru Wolfram had  suggested it. XD I tried getting in her mind except without the Holy  Grail war and summoning servants etc. X3</span></p>
