<h1>Strawberry Panic! Hanabi (part 8 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cradlerobber.html">Cradlerobber Speedo-kun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/hanabi-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>If there was one emotion which best embodied Chikaru, it was a sense of amused satisfaction. 
And it was the sensation she was feeling even now, as she went to meet the new le Rim 
transfer, for the duty at hand reminded her of her own curious climb to power within le Rim, 
and the influence she had managed to exert in that position, despite seemingly having 
nothing to do with anything. Chikaru was profoundly good at keeping out of the ground 
skirmishes many of her peers were seemingly unable to avoid, and perhaps this was what 
permitted her to become president of her school &acirc;&#128;&#147; while others in the running in the 
position had pettily sniped at one another, she herself had remained at a slight distance, 
observing with an inward smile while never getting involved herself &acirc;&#128;&#147; visibly at least. She 
could still recall the looks of shock on the faces of her rivals when the voting tallies 
were posted in the main hall of the school &acirc;&#128;&#147; a shock that was so profound, apparently, that 
neither had ever said a word to her or given her even the slightest bit of trouble since.

However, Chikaru couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t claim that her amusement stemmed solely from her memories of power 
seizure &acirc;&#128;&#147; part of it also had much to do with the fact that permitting her to guide transfer 
students also permitted her to induct people into her Transformation Club. She had gotten 
Remon and Kizuna to join through being assigned as their guide back when they were first 
years, and Kagome had come into the club through the same process, except with Kizuna as her 
guide. So, admittedly she had never gotten a transfer, but transfers were somewhat rare. The 
fact remained that it gave her the opportunity, though.

Yukizawa Fuyuko&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; what a cold name![1] She wondered what on earth would bring a girl who was 
that old into a place such as Astraea Hill &acirc;&#128;&#147; the schools contained within were the sorts of 
places that snobbishly demanded a loyalty best demonstrated by one&acirc;&#128;&#153;s faithfully attending 
for the full seven years of junior high and high school. And when transfers did appear, they 
generally had the &acirc;&#128;&#156;good&acirc;&#128;&#157; sense to do so before the half-way mark, the fourth year. It was 
strange to have someone entering in the fifth. And she didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t recognize the surname&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;

Chikaru almost bit her tongue, realizing with a start that she was beginning to sound like 
her mother &acirc;&#128;&#147; didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t recognize the surname! What utter junk! Her mother had been extremely 
disappointed when Chikaru had opted for St. le Rim as opposed to one of the more &acirc;&#128;&#156;proper&acirc;&#128;&#157; 
schools at Astraea, arguing that le Rim wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t as distinguished and worthwhile as St. Miator 
or St. Spica (her mother herself had been a Miator girl, married practically the moment her 
diploma passed into her hands). Chikaru had been forced to apply to all three, but Spica and 
Miator had turned her down after some skillful self-sabotage at the respective interviews, 
and thus forced her mother to accept le Rim as her daughter&acirc;&#128;&#153;s school-to-be. But the woman 
hadn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t quite recovered yet, and barely disguised her sneers at the more modern le Rim during 
the time Chikaru spent at home. Chikaru preferred spending her school breaks visiting her 
underlings&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; or even distant relatives.

She made a mental note to cajole Kizuna and Remon into bunny costumes at the next 
Transformation Club meeting &acirc;&#128;&#147; she was fairly certain that her mother had never done 
something so base and low-class as dressing up underage girls in fetishistic outfits in her 
life. Granted, she had once discovered a framed picture of her mother as a high school girl, 
her hands clasped with another girl&acirc;&#128;&#153;s, along with a yellowed letter that contained some 
truly scandalous information (at least by her mother&acirc;&#128;&#153;s standards) which suggested that some 
things at Astraea had never changed. She wondered if her father had any idea!

Her father was similar to her mother in that he was terrifically old fashioned. His own 
snobbery wasn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t nearly as clear as his wife&acirc;&#128;&#153;s, but he, too, looked down on those he 
considered to be beneath him socially and financially. But his disdain was disguised 
somewhat by his distant nature, he playing the role of the &acirc;&#128;&#156;proper&acirc;&#128;&#157; father he had learned 
from his own father as a child. &acirc;&#128;&#156;Proper&acirc;&#128;&#157; fathers left the concerns of his children to his 
wife, descending into their lives on rare occasion, generally something confined solely to 
dinnertime when he was not away on business. Chikaru couldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t remember anything about him 
from before the age of seven or so, and she sometimes liked to think that it was possible he 
hadn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t existed before then at all &acirc;&#128;&#147; he&acirc;&#128;&#153;d simply been quietly interjected into their 
household because her mother&acirc;&#128;&#153;s previous model had worn out and needed to be replaced! And 
so, apparently, he was a robot. The notion had kept her much amused during many a meal at 
home during her adolescence.

Considering her parents, she didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t know where she&acirc;&#128;&#153;d gotten her own personality from &acirc;&#128;&#147; 
perhaps there was a black sheep aunt or cousin who never warranted mention due to her 
parents&acirc;&#128;&#153; need for proper aristocratic behavior. That could be her project for her college 
years &acirc;&#128;&#147; discovering the lost Minamoto family treasure!

But Chikaru forced herself out of her reverie, tucking it away for later consideration, as 
she approached the parlor. Fuyuko would&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve been instructed by the sister to meet her there, 
and Chikaru was running a little bit late, so she hoped to find the girl waiting. She could 
hear some voices coming from within the room as she approached the door, and a few idle 
notes as the piano keys were hit at an unseen girl&acirc;&#128;&#153;s whim. Maybe Fuyuko had managed to make 
some friends already, although classes had yet to start.

However, when Chikaru opened the door, she found that the voices belonged to a pair of 
Miator girls who were also responsible for absentmindedly picking at the piano&acirc;&#128;&#153;s keyboard. A 
girl in a le Rim uniform stood by herself at the window, her hand parting the curtain as she 
looked at whatever lay beyond. Chikaru approached her; she had never seen the girl before, 
and this, coupled with the fact that she was wearing the le Rim uniform, led her to believe 
that this was Fuyuko.

As she walked up to her, Chikaru looked past her out the window, and saw that the gazebo lay 
within sight. But no one was out there, despite the pleasant weather. The wind tossed 
lightly at the trees, and occasionally the sunlight dimmed with a passing cloud. But, all in 
all, it seemed that the day was going to beautiful.

Chikaru tapped the girl lightly on the shoulder. The girl seemed to start somewhat, her 
somewhat glazed eyes suddenly regaining focus, and Chikaru realized she had not really been 
looking at the scenery beyond the window. As the girl turned around, Chikaru introduced 
herself, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Hi, I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m Minamoto Chikaru &acirc;&#128;&#147; I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m the president of St. le Rim, so the sister asked me 
to show you around. There&acirc;&#128;&#153;s an orientation thing, but they only like to have the first years 
do that.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Ah&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m Yukizawa Fuyuko. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s nice to meet you.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Fuyuko&acirc;&#128;&#153;s voice was a bit colorless, and there was a curious lack of physical presence to 
her. It was all Chikaru to do to keep from openly smirking &acirc;&#128;&#147; a perfect person to recruit for 
the Transformation Club! It was much easier to get people like this into good costumes than 
it was with someone occasionally hard-headed like Kizuna. And she probably wouldn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t be too 
hard to persuade to join some of the other clubs too &acirc;&#128;&#147; the Waiting in Line Club could always 
do with another member.

But for now Chikaru was the allegedly responsible le Rim president, dutifully teaching her 
new sister-in-arms about le Rim and Astraea. She adjusted her attitude accordingly.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Shall we start? I think you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve probably gotten to know Ichigo-sha since you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve been here a 
couple of days already, so let&acirc;&#128;&#153;s head over to le Rim&acirc;&#128;&#153;s classroom buildings.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Fuyuko nodded, looking a bit uncertain, but Chikaru marked it down to being simply her 
personality. She definitely seemed the sort of girl who was never entirely certain of 
anything, but never had enough will to speak out about her uncertainties, since she was also 
uncertain about whether she was uncertain or not. A bit different than the previous transfer 
students she had dealt with &acirc;&#128;&#147; Nagisa, from Miator, had been bubbly and bewildered, thanks in 
large part to Shizuma. Hikari, a Spica girl, had been similar to this, but it was clear her 
quietness and softness overlay a fairly warm person. But maybe Chikaru was just letting 
Fuyuko&acirc;&#128;&#153;s parents&acirc;&#128;&#153; unfortunate naming sense get to her. She had just me the girl, after all; 
it was likely her apparent coldness was just a matter of her being shy. And the best way to 
deal with that fact was to force her into open conversation.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;So, where are you from?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

They had by now passed out of the front door of Ichigo-sha, the bright sun monetarily 
blinding after the darkness of the front hall. The air smelled warm, and there was a faint 
whiff of blooming flowers in the wind.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Kyoto.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Chikaru breezed by the one-word answer, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh, and did you go to school there?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Yes.&acirc;&#128;&#157; There was a slight hesitation, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Keisuke Senior High.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Did you not like it?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Fuyuko fiddled slightly with the hem of her shirt, not looking at Chikaru, hesitating yet 
again before responding, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Ah&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; no, I liked it&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Chikaru raised her eyebrows, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

But Fuyuko didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t offer a response, though, so Chikaru prodded more explicitly, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Why did you 
come here?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Well&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&#157; Her eyes now drifted toward the sky, &acirc;&#128;&#156;My mother thought it was more suitable.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Chikaru nodded, and decided to let personal details rest for the moment, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Well, I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve been 
going here since I finished elementary school &acirc;&#128;&#147; there has been talk of expanding the schools 
into elementary levels, too, but they still haven&acirc;&#128;&#153;t done it. People don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t really like the 
idea of elementary-aged boarding students, after all, although many think not having one 
hurts us in relation to other private girls&acirc;&#128;&#153; schools.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Fuyuko nodded, seeming only vaguely interested.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;But, anyway,&acirc;&#128;&#157; Chikaru continued, &acirc;&#128;&#156;you don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t really need to know that stuff.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;The three schools here are somewhat competitive with one another, although Spica and Miator 
care a lot more about competing than le Rim does. Miator excels in academics, Spica in 
sports, and le Rim in the arts. Miator is also known as the school of brides, since a lot of 
the girls there are already engaged and will be married shortly after graduation. Spica is 
very strict and has some strange rules. le Rim is the most open of the three schools.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

From where they stood on the path, the cathedral and library were both within view, along 
with the pond at the center of campus.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;The cathedral is there; we have Sunday worship services every week there. The library is 
right across the pond there. If you turn left on this path and walk for a little bit, you&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll 
come to Spica. But we&acirc;&#128;&#153;re going right, since that&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll take us to le Rim.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Chikaru pointed things out as they walked, and related some other information, such as the 
stables that were by Spica. Fuyuko was generally quiet, giving only occasional utterances to 
indicate that she was listening. They arrived at St. le Rim with Chikaru&acirc;&#128;&#153;s initial 
impression of Fuyuko having barely changed. Once inside of le Rim&acirc;&#128;&#153;s buildings, she 
admittedly did a bit of an uncharacteristically perfunctory job. It was difficult to remain 
energetic when Fuyuko displayed such a lack thereof, along with a further lack of interest.

As the neared the end of the survey of le Rim&acirc;&#128;&#153;s important rooms, which included where Fuyuko 
would be having homeroom, Chikaru finally passed onto the schools&acirc;&#128;&#153; system of governance, 
specifically that of the Etoile.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; a few friends of my cousin told me about that a little.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

It was the longest sentence Chikaru had managed to pry out of her thus far, and she suddenly 
felt reenergized, &acirc;&#128;&#156;So your cousin goes here?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Yes&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; well, Miator.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;What&acirc;&#128;&#153;s her name?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Tsukidate Chiyo.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh, I know her! So I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m sure I know who the girls who told you about it were &acirc;&#128;&#147; was one of 
them half the Etoile.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Ah&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; no.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh, well, Hikari&acirc;&#128;&#153;s probably busy with those duties, anyway&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&#157; Chikaru looked thoughtful for 
a moment, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Was there a girl with red hair?&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Um, yes.&acirc;&#128;&#157; The words came out sounding strangely stilted.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Then that was Nagisa. I know all of them; I&acirc;&#128;&#153;m quite fond of those girls.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Ah&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;&acirc;&#128;&#157; And it was back to the one-word responses.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;The Etoile is determined yearly through a contest. They participate in the student 
government meetings and help make decisions. But they also have more ceremonial things to 
do, like taking care of the Astraea greenhouse.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

&acirc;&#128;&#156;They said&acirc;&#128;&brvbar; they were like the king and queen.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

Chikaru laughed, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Yes, that is probably a good way of putting it.&acirc;&#128;&#157;

They had arrived back at the dorm by now, and Chikaru opened the door for Fuyuko, gesturing 
for her to go ahead when the girl hesitated (something that was apparently her favorite 
thing to do). Chikaru stepped in, her eyes readjusting to the dimness of the hall. She was 
about to ask Fuyuko if she needed help with anything else, when she suddenly realized there 
was another person in the hall with them.

&acirc;&#128;&#156;Makoto!&acirc;&#128;&#157; She exclaimed with some surprise.

A green-haired girl clad in Spica white turned with a smirk. The prodigal daughter had 
returned.
