<h1>S.O.S. (Save Our School) (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/sos-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>-Prologue-

A pair of schoolgirls in beautifully simple black uniforms stood up 
against a plain curtain backdrop borrowed from one of the author&#39;s other 
fanfics. One of the girls was older with long, dark hair, and carried 
herself with dignity and grace. The younger girl was a brunette who wore 
her hair in ponytails and was a bit shy. The older student bowed to the 
audience.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she said pleasantly, &quot;My name is Sachiko Ogasawara, and this is 
my petite soeur, Yumiko Fukuzawa. Say hello to everyone out there 
reading this Yumi.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the bashful brunette asked nervously, &quot;Oh, um... Hi,&quot; she said, 
blushing profusely as she bowed to the audience.

Sachiko smiled at the girl in the ponytails, then turned back to address 
the people at home, &quot;You&#39;re probably wondering why Yumi and myself are 
here introducing this story instead of starring in a Marimite fanfic of 
our own. Rest assured, I have no complaints about Strawberry Panic. It&#39;s 
a wonderful show that just happens to copy some of our scenes. Of 
course, they have the right to do that, and I have absolutely no 
problems with it whatsoever (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery 
after all). Even if they did take the greenhouse idea. And the piano, 
come to mention it. And the dance, the play, the...&quot;

&quot;Sachiko-sama,&quot; Yumiko interrupted, &quot;I... I think...&quot;

&quot;(sigh) I know, I know; get on with it, right?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean... That is...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Sachiko said reassuringly, &quot;Anyways, the two of us are 
here to present the life of Saint Miator, patron saint of leaf blowers. 
Yumi, go ahead.&quot;

The timid brunette in the ponytails nodded as she pulled out a sheet of 
paper, &quot;Hai. Saint Miator was born in the year of our Lord 1823 to pig 
farmers out in France. He joined the Franciscans at age eighteen, and 
was sent to missionary work in Japan.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid he wasn&#39;t the brightest of friars,&quot; Sachiko explained as she 
took up the story, &quot;Once when a starving man came up to him and 
explained he&#39;d had no food for two days, Saint Miator told him not to 
worry, as it all still tasted the same. He died when his superiors told 
him to rake the autumn leaves, and in a mistaken attempt to save time he 
tried to cut out the middle man and rake the leaves before they hit the 
ground. The friars who observed him fall out of the large eighty-foot 
oak tree he was working in said that his last words were, &#145;Oh Christ!&#39; 
Saint Miator, Patron Saint of Leaf Blowers, Pray for us. Amen.&quot;

The two girls bowed their heads and joined their hands in prayer for a 
second or two before looking back up at the audience.

&quot;And now,&quot; Sachiko announced, &quot;We return you to your regularly-scheduled 
fanfic. Say goodbye Yumi.&quot;

&quot;Goodbye Yumi.&quot;

-Chapter 4-

-The Press Conference-

The group of young women waited in the waiting room of the diocesan 
headquarters in Okinawa. As waves of both excitement and anxiety washed 
over the girls at having been able to make it this far, a group of 
newspaper and TV reporters came into the waiting room. As the girls 
watched, an Italian Jesuit came out and quickly showed them into a side 
room where the Bishop would be giving his press conference. As some of 
the reporters and their cameramen gave weird looks to the girls dressed 
up as a panda and as Jun the Swallow, Yaya frowned.

&quot;We would&#39;ve been better off disguising ourselves as members of the 
press,&quot; she muttered.

Meanwhile, in the St. Miator group, Nagisa looked troubled.

&quot;Nagisa-chan?&quot; Tamao asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Nagisa said hesitantly, &quot;Something&#39;s troubling me. I mean, we 
got here by a bus and then taxi, right?&quot;

Tamao nodded her head, &quot;Yes, so?&quot;

&quot;Well, Okinawa is a series of islands not connected to the mainland. We 
never took a boat or a plane, so how did we...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Shizuma asked as she saw Tamao talking to the girl 
she was in love with. Tamao immediately noted the tone of jealousy in 
the Etoile&#39;s voice while Nagisa remained as blissfully ignorant as ever.

&quot;We have a big problem,&quot; Tamao answered, &quot;Nagisa thinks she may have 
discovered a hole in the plot.&quot;

Shizuma smiled, &quot;Let me get this straight; we come from a Catholic 
girl&#39;s school in Japan which just happens to be filled with nothing but 
lesbians, and now Nagisa thinks there might be a hole in the plot?&quot;

&quot;Okinawa is actually a prefecture made up of a series of islands,&quot; 
Nagisa said, &quot;How did we get here without planes or boats?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Shizuma gasped as her eyes widened, &quot;You... You&#39;re right,&quot; she 
admitted as the group from St. Lulim came over. Chikaru, having 
overheard most of the conversation, spoke up.

&quot;Hmmm... A good question. Maybe the members of the Secret Club can find 
out...&quot;

&quot;Wait a second,&quot; Tamao interrupted, &quot;With all due respect, the only case 
you and the Secret Club ever solved successfully was that case of the 
missing umbrella. Every other case you&#39;ve ever been involved in has gone 
unsolved.&quot;

&quot;I hate to agree with her, but she&#39;s right on this one,&quot; Nagisa said, &quot;I 
can still remember hearing later about your &#145;case of the girl in the 
hallway&#39;...&quot;

-Flashback-

&quot;Okay gang,&quot; Chikaru said, &quot;Now that we&#39;ve found the glove, that 
newspaper clipping, and the phosphorescent paint, I think we&#39;re ready to 
solve this mystery.&quot;

&quot;Jinkies Chikaru-sama,&quot; Hyuuga replied, &quot;Then we&#39;d better set up a trap 
to catch the ghost in the hallway whose always crying at night.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Chikaru answered, &quot;Now all we need is bait... Kagome?&quot;

Kagome shook her head as she held her bear up, &quot;Ohshibaru says 
&#39;Rut-roh.&#39;&quot;

&quot;My glasses,&quot; Natsume said as she fumbled around nearby in the dark, 
&quot;Somebody help me find my glasses.&quot;

-End Flashback-

&quot;After all that, not only did you girls fail to solve the mystery, but 
it was Nagisa and I who discovered it was just a cat,&quot; Tamao finished.

&quot;Maybe, but...&quot;

&quot;Sisters,&quot; the Italian Jesuit priest from earlier said as he came out of 
the conference room, Sisters, please; we&#39;re about to conduct a press 
conference. I&#39;m going to have to ask all of you to keep your voices 
down, and...&quot;

&quot;Father, please wait,&quot; Miyuki Rokujou answered, &quot;I realize the Bishop is 
busy, but we must speak to him about a school closing.

&quot;The Bishop wants to close down our girl&#39;s school,&quot; Amane said, &quot;He 
can&#39;t do that! We have to ask him to reconsider.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Hikari begged, &quot;We must speak with him, we...&quot;

As all the girls seemed to speak at once, the Italian Jesuit began to 
become confused. Japanese was not his first language, and he was having 
difficulty following what was being said.

&quot;Please, please,&quot; the Jesuit interrupted, &quot;One at a time, I...&quot;

Nagisa worriedly watched the proceedings. She then saw cute little 
Kagome and her teddy bear Ohshibaru out of the corner of her eye. She 
ran over and grabbed the young girl by the wrist, and pulled her 
forward.

&quot;Father,&quot; the redhead said, &quot;The Bishop, by closing our school down, 
will be casting this little girl out. As a Bishop, he should have more 
love for a child than that. He&#39;s her Bishop, that makes her his child 
and her Catholic education his responsibility. To love a child, the 
Bishop should... Father? Father, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

The Italian wasn&#39;t quite sure if he&#39;d heard the young nun right or not, 
but if he&#39;d understood her Japanese properly this could cause a scandal 
that would rock the diocese of Okinawa down to its very foundations.

&quot;I... I see...&quot; he stuttered out, &quot;Wait here. Whatever you do, don&#39;t 
talk to any of the reporters until I return.&quot;

As he ran out of the waiting room, the confused girls looked around at 
one another.

&quot;What just happened?&quot; Kenjou asked.

------

The Italian priest went over and over again in his head the conversation 
in the waiting room. The nun had spoken fast and excitedly, which was 
making it difficult for him to be sure he heard her properly. If he had, 
however, the Bishop needed to know immediately.

As he walked into the conference room, he saw that the press conference 
was already underway.

&quot;And those priests that have done wrong have already been removed,&quot; 
Bishop Takahashi declared as the news cameras focused on him, &quot;And we... 
Father Guiseppe?&quot; the Bishop asked as he noticed the Jesuit coming 
towards him, &quot;Father, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Your Eminence,&quot; the priest said, &quot;This would perhaps be best said in 
the privacy of...&quot;

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Bishop Takahashi said as the television news cameras 
continued to roll, &quot;This is a press conference about the scandals in the 
diocese. We must be totally open, and expose all before the light. We 
have nothing to hide.&quot;

&quot;Y... Your Eminence, are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the Bishop answered with a smile, &quot;Now what&#39;s so 
important?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the priest began, &quot;There&#39;s a group of young nuns out in the 
waiting room with a little girl and a teddy bear. I&#39;m not totally sure I 
understood what they were saying, but apparently the little girl is your 
love-child.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; the bishop cried as flashbulbs suddenly started going off.

------

&quot;It was whatever you said to him that made him wig out and run off,&quot; 
Momori said as she pointed an accusatory finger at Nagisa.

&quot;All I said was that as her Bishop, Kagome was his responsibility and 
that he should love the child enough to make sure she stayed in a 
Catholic school, I...&quot; the redhead was cut off as the side door burst 
open and a horde of reporters and photographers swooped into the room.

&quot;There she is!&quot; one of the reporters said as he rushed over to Kagome. 
He put his arm around the young girl and turned to look at his 
cameraman, &quot;We on? Good. This field reporter Toshiro Mifune with a young 
girl who claims to be Bishop Takahashi&#39;s love child.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Chikaru asked.

&quot;What?&quot; Miyuki gasped.

&quot;What&#39;s your name young girl?&quot; the reporter asked.

&quot;Kagome,&quot; the girl answered, &quot;And this is my friend Ohshibaru...&quot;

&quot;What in the hell just happened?&quot; Toumori asked as the Jesuit and the 
Bishop ran into the waiting room.

&quot;That&#39;s her!&quot; the Italian priest said as he pointed at Kagome, &quot;That&#39;s 
the nun who said the girl was your love child!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; the redhead asked as flashbulbs went off and microphones were 
pushed into her face, &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I meant! She&#39;s a student in a 
private Catholic girl&#39;s school that the Bishop wants to close, and...&quot;

&quot;Girl&#39;s school?&quot; one of the reporters asked.

&quot;Of course!&quot; a female reporter said excitedly, &quot;In order to hide the 
existence of a love child, the Bishop had the girl sent off to a 
Catholic girl&#39;s school.&quot;

&quot;A cover-up!&quot; another reporter shouted.

&quot;That&#39;s a lie!&quot; Bishop Takahashi cried out, &quot;I don&#39;t know any of these 
people, and...&quot;

&quot;Hey kid,&quot; a reporter said as he pushed a microphone up to Chiyo, 
&quot;You&#39;re one of the girl&#39;s friends, right?&quot; he asked as his camera 
focused in on the girl in the panda suit, &quot;Can you tell us anything 
about...&quot; he was cut off as the girl took the mike away from him and 
stared into the camera.

&quot;Have you ever thought about your soul, can it be saved?&quot; she shouted 
out at the audience watching at home, &quot;Or perhaps you think that when 
you are dead you just stay in the grave!&quot;

&quot;What th... You can&#39;t take over my newscast like that!&quot; the reporter 
said angrily, &quot;Just who do you think you are?&quot;

&quot;Look into my eyes you&#39;ll see who I am,&quot; Chiyo said as she looked back 
at the reporter, &quot;My name is Lucifer, please take my hand!&quot;

&quot;A devil cult!&quot; a nearby reporter cried out, &quot;Right in the middle of a 
Catholic Girl&#39;s school!&quot; As reporters and photographers now turned their 
focus to little Chiyo, Toumori turned and scowled angrily at Miyuki 
Rokujou.

&quot;This is all your fault!&quot; the blonde snarled angrily as Kenjou and 
Momori came up to stand behind the St. Spica student council president.

&quot;What did you just say?&quot; Miyuki asked, narrowing her eyes as Shizuma 
came up to listen behind her.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Kenjou said with a cruel smirk, &quot;It was Nagisa&#39;s speech 
that started this mess, and it was the freak in the panda suit that has 
now escalated things to this level.&quot;

&quot;Both of whom are St. Miator students,&quot; Momori joined in, &quot;Both of whom 
are under you and Etoile-sama. In the end, you&#39;re both responsible for 
this fiasco!&quot;

&quot;This is a complete disaster,&quot; Toumori cried, &quot;How could things possibly 
get any worse?&quot;

As if in answer, the front door of the diocesan headquarters burst open 
and the Head Sister of the Strawberry dorms burst in.

&quot;There you are!&quot; she snarled angrily as she saw her students disguised 
in the nun habits and cosplay outfits, &quot;I demand an explanation!&quot;

&quot;What you get and what you see,&quot; Chiyo answered as reporters continued 
to swarm around her, &quot;Things that don&#39;t come easily...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the Head Sister asked, &quot;What&#39;s with her?&quot;

-To Be Continued-

-Epilogue-

&quot;Hello, Chikaru here once again. The author wanted you all to know that 
this chapter is dedicated to Naolin for graciously giving of her time to 
beta read the Prologue, as well as suggesting the use of the Secret 
Club/Scooby Doo spoof in the story. He also wishes to give a big shout 
out to StarCross for pointing out that it&#39;s impossible to simply drive 
to Okinawa. Finally, the Sabbath songs Chiyo quoted from this time are 
After Forever, N.I.B., and Snowblind.

&quot;Next time: What will happen to Bishop Takahashi now that the press 
conference has turned into a disaster? With the arrival of the Head 
Sister, is there any way whatsoever our young heroines can possibly 
still manage to salvage the situation and save the school. And just how 
did everyone make it to the Okinawa Province anyways? Tune in next time; 
same Strawberry time, same Strawberry channel.&quot;</pre>
