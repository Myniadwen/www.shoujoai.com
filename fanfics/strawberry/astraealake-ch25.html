<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just for the  record, I've got nothing against people who hold Momomi's parents'  opinions, but Momomi does. No, wait. I do have a problem with them, but  I don't suppose that will be an issue with anyone reading this fic.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed. She hated to play at polite member of society, it didn’t suit  her at all. But if it was for Momomi, she’d force herself. Besides, she  could begin an important part of their planning. It was based on one of  the oldest military axioms there was; the principle of divide and  conquer. “So, you’re Momomi’s sister,” she began, falling into step  with the older girl. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mostly good, I hope,” Luigia said with a smile. “You’re her roommate, you said? I hope you get on well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We argue a lot, but we’re still good friends,” Kaname said, slightly awkwardly. <em>I’m not good at this sincerity thing. </em>“I’m  glad for the company she offers, for a start. During my first year, I  was the odd one out, and that made the evenings a little dull.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can imagine,” Luigia remarked. “But isn’t a little cramped, sharing a room that small with someone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it?” Kaname frowned. “Well, it is, but you know, you get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so. It looks a little uncomfortable for me, though.” Luigia  looked thoughtful. “And not having any servants, too, that must be  troublesome for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I know.” Kaname felt slightly  light-headed. “Absolutely. But like I said, you get used to it. They  have things strange in Miator, though, because they have the  underclassmen act as room temps, which is to say servants, for the  upperclassmen, and of course they don’t get paid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? How  bizarre… I recall something like that in one of her early letters,  actually.” Luigia sighed. “How’s she been getting on? She wrote less  after a while, so I’ve been worrying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What am I going to say? The truth? Like hell…</em>“She’s been doing just fine. She’s one of the smartest students in the year, after all…” <em>True enough. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  she’s been happy, I hope? I’d hate it if she bullied or lonely, but it  must be difficult, to transfer to a new school in the middle of term.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned slightly. <em>Annoyingly smart girl. </em>“She’s been getting on just fine. I’ve been here to help her, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia smiled. “I’m sure.”</span></p>
“Of  course, she’s a great help to me as well,” Kaname noted. “I’ve never  been very good at… how would she put it… looking after myself. So  having her around to help me with my necktie and so on is good.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yes. It’s very helpful of her. And if anyone  threatens her, I’ll clobber them.” Kaname scowled. “Not that that ever  happens, of course. But if it did, then I’d definitely protect her and  retaliate in kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Luigia replied, giggling softly.  That was something she seemed to have in common with her little sister.  “But I was just thinking how I always had to sort out Momomi’s  appearances when she was at home. She was particularly bad with  formalwear, I remember.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her in surprise. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really… she never did like clothes like that, so she was often careless. I had to sort her out every time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s surprising. I guess that puts me in my place on the chain of getting dressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s not like she didn’t know the right way to go about things,” Luigia  said. “She just never took any real interest in it. I’m glad, though. I  always enjoyed doing that, but I was never sure whether she found it a  bother or not. If she’s doing the same thing to you, she must have  found it tolerable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can’t say I resent it, exactly. If  only because it means I have to do less work myself, so I suppose I’m  exploiting her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia laughed. “I never thought of it that way, but now I’m all disillusioned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded absently. <em>She’s  pleasant enough, I suppose. But I can’t say I enjoy the mental image of  her fussing with Momomi. And that’s ridiculous. She’s Momomi’s sister,  for God’s sake! Perhaps I liked the idea of being fussed over as a  unique thing, but that’s just naivety, I shouldn’t be too worried…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  if Momomi’s dressing properly herself, and more than that, helping you  dress, she must like this place,” Luigia said. “Not if I compare it to  her lethargy back then. You must have been a positive influence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm…” Kaname shrugged, strangely disarmed by this girl. “I wouldn’t say that, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I hope she doesn’t get bullied or anything like that. I wouldn’t like to hear that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not,” Kaname said. “Nothing like that would happen… but even if  it did, it’s not like she’d give a damn. She’s so independent-minded  that it all bounces off, if there’s anything.” She listened to herself  for a moment. “Well, I suppose I’m not telling you anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really, no, but it’s nice to hear another person say it. She has always  been that way, so I don’t worry too much. And if she was hypothetically  bullied, you’d protect her, yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “I’d sooner see  me hurt than her. If only because I actually have some upper body  strength and combat training. She has the frame, weight and strength of  the more nebulous kind of cloud. In the same way, though, throwing  punches at her really is as futile as punching cloud. She doesn’t care  about that stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia nodded. “You know a lot about her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, so do you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  am her sister... my, these grounds really are huge.” Luigia looked  around, seemingly impressed. “Even if there are no servants, you have  sufficient room, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you want peace and quiet, you can find it,” Kaname agreed. “Suits me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And suits Momomi just fine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. I used to think it was a waste of space, myself, but I’ve  gotten used to it. I suppose you could say that she converted me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Having such a large forest is unusual… well, I suppose it’s an interesting feature. The hilltop location is nice as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  forced back a sigh, turning it into a conscientious nod. “There’s  spectacular views to be had. Especially from the swimming pool and the  clock tower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s always good. But tell me, you say you have combat training?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m third Kyu in karate,” Kaname said. “Ah… that’s to say, three from  black belt. I dropped it before I got any further than that, but I  still remember a lot. Right now I’m doing kendo, and I’ve had more  generalised training as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You certainly have a very unusual hobby.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’ve always thought it’s more useful than, I don’t know, horse . Or,  well, tea ceremony, at least with horse riding you can get places fast.  Plus it teaches inner peace and stuff. Karate, not horse riding.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia laughed again. “So they say. You’re quite an interesting person, Kenjou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gritted her teeth and remembered Momomi. “Please, call me Kaname,” she said, with a half-attempt at sincere smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia smiled. “Very well, Kaname-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Okay, that’s something. Now, how to take advantage of this? If we’re even moderately getting on, I should strike…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you mind if I ask a personal question, Kaname-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn. </em>“Shoot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How much do you like Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just stared. “Huh? In what sense? I hope you’re not saying anything-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  I mean to say,” Luigia said, waving her hands distractedly, “is to ask  you how strong your friendship is with her. Because she might be  leaving this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know.” Kaname sighed. “What do you want? My honest answer?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi  is the only person in this school I give a damn about. She is my best  friend and my only friend, the only person who can make me give a damn  about this place at all. I don’t know quite why, because she’s soft,  annoying and sarcastic, but I like her company.” Kaname folded her  arms. “So if you want to take her away, I’m going to oppose that. I  won’t mince my words and make it easy for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia laughed  again, turning away in embarrassment. “You’re very frank, Kaname-san.  It’s a good characteristic. But you’re right, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  to say, I like my sister as well, and I’ve missed her company  terribly,” Luigia said. “It feels wrong that our family should be so  apart, and when my father said that he’d be taking her back I was glad  because we could finally be together again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You will always be  there for her,” Kaname said. “If you’re a half-decent family, you will  always be waiting for her to come back. But from what she’s told me,  she doesn’t make friends easily, and friends don’t have that  connection. She needs them as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right, of course. I  suppose I hoped that if she had no important ties, it would be painless  for her.” Luigia looked at the ground. “But when she did write, you  always featured heavily in her letters, Kaname-san. As you said, this  isn’t an easy situation for us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t intend to preach, but surely her opinion is the most important one,” Kaname noted. “And she wants to stay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. I find that a little saddening… so I guess it’s good, in a way,  that you’re here. It would be even worse if she would avoid coming home  without having anything to stay for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How very sincere…is this really Momomi’s sister? </em>“So, what are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  I want is for her to come back.” Luigia looked up at her eyes. “But  that’s the selfishness in me speaking, like the selfishness in you says  that she should stay, even if we both come up with better reasons than  our own feelings. Personally, I’d accept her will, though, because she  should be happy. That’s important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’d sacrifice your own feelings for hers?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia smiled. “That’s such a dramatic way of putting it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was just comparing it to someone else I know, that’s all,” Kaname said.  “That person said that you should always fight for your feelings, even  if the loved one’s heart is elsewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s an interesting perspective. Isn’t that attitude a bit selfish, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  she said your way is stupid self-sacrifice, more or less.” Kaname  shrugged. “To be fair, you’re talking about sisterly love, while she’s  talking about romantic love, so they’re not directly comparable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia nodded. “And what does Kaname-san think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About which one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I suppose I’ll have to disappoint you. I’d agree with her attitude, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You appear to have me at a disadvantage, with that conviction,” Luigia said good-naturedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, remember, you have an advantage as well. I may not be her friend forever, but you’ll always be her sister.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked up at Momomi as they walked through the doors, deep in  conversation with her parents. Well, strictly speaking, her mother. Her  father was present but had the general attitude and attentiveness of a  meat-eater walking through a museum of vegetarianism. He didn’t  consider his surroundings relevant to his life in any real way. “What  are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About this?” Luigia asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shall I be honest again? Momomi wants to stay. Your father wants her to go. If she can’t persuade her, he’ll force her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My,  you’re very ruthless, Kaname-san,” Luigia joked. “Not only have you  forced my surrender, you’re now conscripting me to fight for the other  side.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t force you to do anything,” Kaname said. “Which is  more than we can say for her father. I just want it to be Momomi’s  choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You want Momomi to chose you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s true  enough, but it misses the point. She’s chosen me, if you like those  terms.” Kaname glanced at the older girl. “I’d like that choice to be  respected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You take a very forceful attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  never been good at sneaking round a subject, so I tend to just charge  ahead.” Kaname’s eyes didn’t waver. “If you’re sincere when you say  that her feelings are the most important thing, then you can’t just sit  by. That’s tacitly condoning the will her father exerts. If you’re  being honest, you’ll still have to fight, but I’m not your opponent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m glad that Momomi has such a strong and important friend, and I  suppose you’re right. You should be glad she has such a patient and  saint-like sister.” Luigia smiled wanly then lowered her voice  slightly. “But I’m not sure what I can do, even if I try to help.  Father doesn’t take much heed of my words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I’ve gathered. I  just want your support, that’s all.” Kaname swept the library with  moody eyes. “Perhaps I am being selfish, but I think honesty is better  than lying about my feelings. I want her to stay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re very  strong, Kaname-san. I can see why Momomi admires you.” Luigia chuckled.  “Of course, she doesn’t lack strength herself, but force of character  and conviction isn’t enough to secure anything, sadly, though I wish it  was. I may not be able to help you at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. But I’m not  a heartless bastard, either, you know.” Kaname laughed. “Well, perhaps  I am. But Momomi isn’t. She’ll definitely be glad that you’re behind  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi herself was having a harder time. “Well, this is the  library. It’s pretty big, as you can see, bigger than the one at home.  It’s also entirely run by students, under the loose supervision of a  Sister. That’s typical of Astraea, as I’ve shown you before, the  students really do run everything around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s slightly bizarre, isn’t it? Very anarchistic,” her father said curtly.</span></p>
“Now, dear,” Yukaho began. “It’s very good for-”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s all it is, though. You can’t organise important aspects of the school by entrusting them to teenagers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled bitterly. <em>You may be his Serané, mother, but he sure as hell isn’t your Kariya. </em>“Actually,  you’d be accurate if we were normal teenagers,” she said, putting on  her best snobbish tone. “But we’re not, we’re aristocrats all, so  leadership’s a natural enough thing for us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hn. That doesn’t give you the mental maturity to deal with things like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, I’d argue the reverse,” Momomi said. “Because we have to do  things like this, we’re forced to become more mature. That way we can  fulfil the roles we’re given. Besides, isn’t it better to start and  make mistakes now than come virginally into the duty of running a  family without any prior experience of responsibility?”</span></p>
Rodrigo  chuckled. “Well, that isn’t one of your worries, girl. But I take your  point. Better than making mistakes with money or important things…  though going to this school might be a mistake with money in itself.  It’s not cheap.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tutors are more expensive,” Momomi said instantly. “And I’ve told  you, I can pay my own way here if you’ll just give me until the end of  the year.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was talking about the whole institution. But it’s still not relevant, considering you’re coming back home anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi opened her mouth to argue, then remembered Kaname’s advice. “As you say,” she said diplomatically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, it’s very nice to be back here again,” Yukaho said, looking  around. “I used to spend a lot of time in this library. There’s some  very fascinating books here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rodrigo grunted. “I should think that would go for any library.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  of course, but here especially, because it has many rare ones. It has  one of the largest collections of any such school in Japan. Isn’t that  right, Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ahh… of course. It makes for excellent reference material. Especially History.” <em>I only actually read the romances, of course, but I suppose mother should know.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“History,  that’s another thing,” Rodrigo grunted. “I dread to think what you  learn around here. Japanese taught as Italian, Italian not taught at  all and nothing to study but Japanese history. It’s leaving you with a  very skewed education.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi resisted the urge to quip that he could do with studying Japanese a whole lot more. <em>Probably not the right note to strike. </em>“Well,  our education here is very broad,” Momomi said. “This is a very  international school, so we study very widely. For instance, our last  major topic in History was the Napoleonic Wars.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. That’s fine as far as it goes, but I dislike foreign bias in education. You won’t get a balanced picture that way.”</span></p>
If  it was Kaname, I’d simply say it. The only one being biased here is  you. Instead I have to internalise and internalise and internalise, and  it’s driving me mad. It always does when I’m around him, and in the end  I can’t contain it and I burst out…
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The teachers here have always been even-handed,” Yukaho said.  “After all, Diralna-san is here along with our Momomi and students from  every country of the world. Under those circumstances-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  would be helpful if any of those students actually knew anything about  history,” Rodrigo interrupted. “As it they’re just having their heads  filled with oriental nonsense at their most vulnerable phase. I’ve  never been keen on foreign education.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yukaho winced visibly. “Well, it’s not nonsense, because-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At  least it’s an education,” Momomi snapped. “And a more balanced one than  tutors, at that. I’m willing to bet you don’t know anything about  Japanese history.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be impertinent!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought so,” Momomi retorted. Then she bit her lip. “Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He glared at her. “Just remember your place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just sighed, her mind drifting off as her mother strove bravely to fill the silence. <em>It  looks like I’ve got a long to go. Just what can I do to change this  obnoxious, stubborn, pigheaded, impatient stupid idiot’s mind? She  frowned thoughtfully. In other words, this is what it must be like to  have Kaname as an opponent, too.</em> As it was, she was stuck like that  for the rest of the morning. Her mother kept up a vague stream of  chatter and supported her weakly, only to melt away whenever resistance  arose. Kaname and Luigia stayed a few steps behind, talking from time  to time, silent at others, but apparently comfortable. And her father,  of course, found fault with every single aspect of the school, which  was infuriating. <em>I wouldn’t mind so much if it was decent arguments  he was coming up with, but it’s just uninformed nonsense that I  demolish every time! The problem is that I’m not gaining ground, even  if I do that. He’s come here with his mind made up and his prejudices  secure, and it’s impossible for me to affect him because he isn’t  actually listening, and he isn’t interested in discussion. I used to  think that Kaname was my enemy, but she always at least had the decency  to know what I was saying. My father just doesn’t care, and that’s what  really makes an enemy. </em>Momomi frowned at her own thought. <em>So,  in other words, he doesn’t acknowledge my existence. Like Olesa and I,  or Kaname and Amane. It’s actually a lot more infuriating when you’re  the one experiencing it. I’ll admit that much.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of course, she  was practised by now, and could think like that while keeping up her  own stream of banal chatter. “And this is the canteen, as you can see.  It provides breakfast, snacks in breaktime, lunches and dinner. The  food here’s in every kind of style, Japanese, Chinese, European,  American… it’s really very varied. As I’ve been stressing, it’s an  international school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sound like a tour guide,” Rodrigo said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course. I’m trying to educate, after all.” Momomi looked around and bit her lip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi! Kaname, Momomi! Over here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning, Momomi-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed as they expected two walked in. <em>Not  exactly the best greeting ever. Amiki’s reading from the wrong script  and Olesa knows the words but she sure as hell can’t act. </em>“Hi, you two! I was just showing my family around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  stepped forwards and smiled. “The Phareli, I presume?” she said softly.  But there was something different in the tone. Where she normally spoke  in a quiet, clipped tone her words were a little gentler now, as if  genuinely kind, not robotic. “I am Olesa Perez, and I’m pleased to make  your acquaintance. I’ve heard much about you from Momomi-chan.” She  bowed deeply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amiki Rivera,” her servant said, imitating the gesture. “Pleased to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  ran through the introductions again, annoyed at the necessary  repetition. The two women bowed back while Rodrigo merely nodded.  “Perez-san… I’ve heard that name somewhere before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yukaho, predictably, looked like a vampire had visited her last night and taken a generous portion of her blood. <em>A particularly telling metaphor, really, considering how my father drains her and uses her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re a European family, like you,” Olesa said, managing a smile. “No doubt we’ve met before in different circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed and thanked the gods for her father’s stupidity. Olesa, on the  other hand, looked like someone had made her swallow razor blades, but  kept up a somewhat strained smile. <em>Okay, now I can sympathise. My father’s a bastard.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shall  we sit down?” Olesa suggested. “I imagine you’re all tired after a  morning of walking around, and the food here really is excellent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Okay, you’re freaking me out now. What have you done with the walking computer? </em>A  glance told her that Amiki was wondering the same thing, or perhaps  knowing but not enjoying the development. “That’s a good idea,” Momomi  said. “Shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rodrigo nodded. “Very well. Now, where’s that blasted cousin of mine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hopefully  he’s getting on very well with Diralna-san,” Yukaho said consolingly,  taking her seat. “You shouldn’t worry, my dear. Araldo is mature enough  to handle these things himself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat as well, noticing how they were given strange looks and a wide berth. <em>It’s  hilarious, but adults, family, are a very strange and not entirely  welcome intrusion into the sheltered world of Astraea. Even if I didn’t  know that already, I’d be able to see that now. Well, my father is a  bit scary. </em>She gave the room a second glance. <em>Hopefully no one is sizing up my sister in that way… that would be difficult to explain away. </em>“Shall we get food?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll go,” Kaname offered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too,” Amiki said, not to be outdone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll go as well,” Yukaho said. “It’s been a while since I was here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shook her head. “You shouldn’t. You’re our guests, after all. I’ll go if the two are unable to manage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  it’s no bother. It would be a favour to me.” Yukaho stood, glancing at  her husband. “Is there anything in particular you want, dear?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing offhand. Get what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very well. No, stay seated, Perez-san. I insist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I insist on catching a potential bullet for you all </em>Momomi thought mentally. <em>Damn her and her damn martyr complex. Don’t take responsibility for everyone around you!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And of course, there goes the three best conversationalists too. </em>There  were a few moment of silence before Olesa spoke. “I hear that you’re  considering a possible marriage between your nephew and the Etoile  Diralna, when they come of age,” she said. “Is that true?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re remarkably well-informed,” Rodrigo said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know someone who’s always well-informed, and she told me. You shouldn’t credit me for it, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it is something I’m considering. We haven’t got any further than that, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etoile  Diralna-sama is the first and only child of the Diralna family,  though,” Olesa noted. “She will inherit everything. Forgive me for my  impudence, but surely it is an uneven match to pair her with a nephew  who is not the heir, and a male no less?”</span></p>
Damn. Why didn’t I think of that?
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That matter of the Phareli heir is not a settled one,” Rodrigo  said. “This arrangement was made with that understanding in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shot her sister an alarmed look, but Luigia just shrugged back, as if to say <em>worry about yourself. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand. So, if this marriage goes through, Araldo Phareli-san will become heir? Is that the principle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing is set in stone,” Rodrigo said, frowning. “I do not like gossiping about such things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgive  me,” Olesa said. “It was merely a matter of interest to me, but I said  too much. After all, marriage in this age can mean very much or very  little, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rodrigo nodded. “I can assure you that for my part I will not compromise. My children will be married to those of equal status.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a fascinating attitude of yours,” Olesa replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  decided to break in before Olesa flipped and went for one of the knives  within easy reach. “Do we have to talk about such things, you two? It’s  a matter between Araldo and Serané-sama, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For now, at least,” Rodrigo agreed. “I’ll meet with her later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi broke and decided to do the Etoiles a favour. <em>If nothing else, it’ll make a change from watching my personal debts to those devils pile up. </em>“Though, if I can contradict my own words… are you sure about her, father?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  Serané-sama is beautiful, charming and from good family…” Momomi said,  building up, “but she’s… how would I say this… very light-hearted.  Kariya-sama has always handled the serious business of being Etoiles,  while Serané-sama is more of a… mascot figure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa looked surprised for a quarter of a second then recovered, nodding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean to say that she’s not graced with exceptional intelligence,” Rodrigo said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I wouldn’t phrase it in those terms-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s what you mean. It’s unusual for you to take an interest in such things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  frowned, choosing her words carefully. “The wife of my cousin is an  important matter for the Phareli. It is natural I should take some  interest in it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s all to the good, though you should  learn to trust my judgement.” Rodrigo leaned back. “But truthfully, a  mascot is all we need. The less intelligent she is, the more power  Araldo will have to manage business matters freely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  scowled despite herself, before recovering. “Well, that makes sense as  far as it goes… but it would backfire if Serané-sama was to be too…  controversial. That could damage the reputation of our family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can hardly see what damage one girl can do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi-chan  is referring very delicately to a manner that does not bear  discussion.” Olesa drew herself up slightly. “That’s to say, her  romantic… interests.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rodrigo frowned, leaning forwards. “How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Father…” Momomi said, doing her best to look half-coy, half shocked. “It’s as Olesa said, we don’t talk about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, isn’t it important that I know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not right now. Not in public.”</span></p>
It’s obnoxious that this is all he’s interested in…
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you babbling about now?” Kaname demanded, sitting down and passing Momomi a tuna sandwich.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very funny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ooh, scary. Innocent mistake. Here.” Kaname swapped their sandwiches, handing her friend her favourite cucumber ones.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks. Strange girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  had sat as well, passing Olesa her salmon sandwiches without comment.  Rodrigo, for his part, scowled at the food Yukaho had brought. “Why  would I want sandwiches? I’ve come all this way, woman, mightn’t I try  something that I can’t get every day of the year?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just thought you might want something familiar,” Yukaho replied quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you thought wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, I asked before… what’s this that can’t be talked about in public?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we can’t talk about it in public,” Momomi said pointedly. She broke  when it became plain that her father wouldn’t talk and Kaname wouldn’t  give up. “We were talking about Serané-sama’s somewhat… unusual  romantic interests.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you mean the gay thing?” Kaname snorted. “Well, that’s something everyone knows already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just put her head in her hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa managed to say “Kenjou-san! Do you have to be so… vulgar?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? I mean, you two-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  stopped talking when Momomi kicked her on the shin. She looked at her  parents carefully. Yukaho had her polite horror face on while Rodrigo  looked dark. “You see, it isn’t something we talk about in public.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t hear anything about this,” her father said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I imagine the Diralna don’t exactly advertise such things, but it’s something known to those around her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rodrigo sighed, thinking. “Well, deviant behaviour does occasionally occur even in the best of families…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried not to scowl at that. <em>I  must admit, I feel dirty, having to act like this. A girl who likes  girls pretending that she’s embarrassed and ashamed of girls that likes  girls…it’s cowardly and debasing on such a fundamental level, to have  to go through this pantomime. But what choice do I have? I have to rely  on my father, at least for now. </em>She remembered Serané. <em>Is it  possible to reconcile family with your real identity? Or can it only  ever be one or the other? I’d hate to have to keep up a farce with them  all my life.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have heard rumours about this, but I chose  not to credit them,” Yukaho said. “The poor, confused girl… I hope you  don’t think too badly of her, Rodrigo, it’s not something that can be  helped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s this atmosphere,” Rodrigo growled. “An all-girl’s  school so far from anywhere else in the world. This isn’t a good place  for you to be, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Must resist temptation to scream. I’m gay, already! I’d be gay whether I came here or not! </em>But she managed a smile. “I don’t think something so simple could impact on me either way, father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Eh? It is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It shouldn’t be a problem. Araldo just has to marry her, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re being heartless, dear,” Yukaho said. “You should think of their happiness, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said it yourself, it can’t be helped,” Rodrigo said. “It shouldn’t interfere too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged. “Well, I’d be worried about our reputation. Serané-sama is a  darling girl, but she isn’t very discreet… if she was to… act on…” She  fell silent. <em>I can’t say this. I just can’t. Even if I say I’m a master manipulator, even I have limits. This is one of them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  isn’t my business, but I do understand her concern,” Olesa said,  looking at the table in apparent embarrassment. “As we said, everyone  knows about her as she is. And not just to know… it would be one thing  if she kept it under control, but she-” She didn’t get any further, out  of disgust with herself in turn or for effect, Momomi wasn’t sure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With who?” Rodrigo asked dangerously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With  Kariya-sama,” Kaname said, apparently fed up with the charade. “And her  alone, mind, don’t go screaming about unnatural promiscuity. They’re a  couple and the whole school knows it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, dear,” Yukaho said quietly. “And they seemed such nice girls, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  are nice girls, they’re just gay with each other,” Kaname snapped,  folding her arms. “Get over it. It’s not like they flaunt it or  anything, quite the reverse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s not just something that will go away if you ignore it, either,” Amiki added.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yukaho sighed. “You’re very blunt, Kenjou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just how it is, like it or not. I might as well say it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not your business,” Rodrigo said warningly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  isn’t it?” Kaname said, ignoring another kick. “But I’m just one of the  many who can watch and see it when the wife of a Phareli is committing  adultery with another woman. That wouldn’t say much for the quality of  Phareli manhood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who, you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t, dear,” Yukaho said. “She’s just being honest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rodrigo  scowled. “Hn. There are better ways to say these things… but I can  understand her logic. I’ll think about it. But I’m amazed that this  kind of behaviour is permitted in a religious school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bell  rang, loud and with a piercing clarity. “I’d better go to my lessons,”  Momomi said brightly, standing and throwing her bag over her shoulder.  “I’ll see you all later.” She left at a fast walk, sandwiches in hand. <em>But I don’t think I’ll be able to eat them. I feel sick.</em></span></p>
