</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Kaname sat down, placing Momomi’s tray in front of her seat in anticipation of her arrival. “Hi.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if it isn’t the lover-girl, fresh out of the closet.” Amiki  rested her chin on her right hand, smirking. “Kaname, you owe me… I  don’t know… more than you actually have to give. But that’s cool. I’ll  just laugh at you forever because I was so right after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?” Kaname demanded. Her jaw twitched slightly. Actually, she had some idea…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  Playing dumb, is it?” Amiki leaned forwards. “What was it you said to  me? You were just a friend, didn’t think about her that way, couldn’t  help it, so on and so forth… ring a bell?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “Yeah, yeah. Least I don’t call the girl I like ojou-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  flushed slightly. “Pretty cheeky, aren’t you? But I suppose you’ll be  even more obnoxious from now on… I’ll say this, though. If you’d  followed my advice, this would have been dealt with earlier, and with  less drama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Well, forgive me. Serané  was more convincing than you were, but that’s probably because she’s  the Etoile and you… aren’t. Obviously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, I believe  congratulations are belatedly in order,” Shion observed. “I had hoped  that things would end this way, but didn’t think it would be wise to  get involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say that as if it makes you a saint, but it’s  not a good thing,” Amiki retorted moodily. “Someone like Kaname is so  obtuse she needs other people to do her thinking for her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And shall I tell you the obvious?” Kaname grinned. “You’re blushing. This could be fun…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up,” Amiki growled. “I’ll make you die a thousand deaths.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I’m not the only one in denial-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa placed a hand on the table. “That’s enough.” She closed her eyes, looking bored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stared at her, trying to work out whether that was for effect or out of embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before that occurred, something clicked. “Hey, wait… since when did you guys know about this anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion told us.” Amiki shrugged. “Ask her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion closed her eyes for a moment and smiled, shaking her head. “You weren’t supposed to say that, Rivera-san…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,  what?” Kaname frowned. “Did the Etoiles tell you? Don’t you have them  but good over election fraud, or something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  laughed. “Those two? Perish the thought. If I tried anything with those  two, Kariya-sama would cut me down to size. Fairly literally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And isn’t the pen mightier than the sword?” Kaname’s eyes narrowed. “That sounds like something you’d say, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  in either case, I didn’t hear from the Etoiles. Your secrets are safe  with them, I can assure you… provided you aren’t telling one something  the other doesn’t know.” Shion chuckled. “Then they’re the most  unreliable people on earth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, not the Etoiles.” Kaname thought of Serané telling Kariya all about their… conversation. <em>Damn.  So embarrassing…with the benefit of hindsight, I sound like such an  idiot. I guess I’ll just never let them mention it, ever. To that end,  I need to get better than Kariya at kendo, really fast. Or I could get  a gun. That’d work too. Either way, steps must be taken at the nearest  possible moment. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait…” she frowned. “So if it wasn’t from the Etoiles, then what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion put a finger to the side of her lips. “That’s classified information, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  could care less. I’ll torture you until you tell me anyway.” Kaname  scowled. “I know you’re good at this stuff, but to know by the next  morning-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By late last night, you mean.” Amiki picked over her  food, selecting a lump of rice and eating it. “She phoned us at nine or  something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what?” Kaname glared at her senpai. “That doesn’t even make sense. Wait… I know. You were in the bushes, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can assure you that’s not the case.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t play dumb. It’s the only way…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed theatrically. “Really, Kenjou-kun, do you think I’d stoop so low  as to spy on my friends in such an intimate moment?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ooh…” Amiki began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t want us to answer that,” Kaname finished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed. “Your destructive cynicism is very hurtful. But in any case, I  have better things to do with my time than get leaves on my skirt  spying on two hormonal girls bumbling their way through a confession.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  must have been pretty interested, all the same,” Kaname observed  accusingly. “I mean, if that’s not the case, how did you find out so  soon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? A cute little bird told me, that’s all.” Shion  smiled. “You two don’t own the forest, and the flighty sort of bird  goes where it pleases.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Translation. Someone from her first year lolita harem told her,” Amiki explained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  resent that accusation.” Shion closed her eyes. “This one was a member  of Ohtori-san’s harem. I just happened past her and you two chanced to  come up in the conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right…” Kaname tried to calculate the odds of that. <em>Not  very likely. Now, if we remember that she heard that we were meeting  about something personal and go from there…that’s more likely. </em>“You have a lot of friends in the younger years, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re not friends as such, though they’re pleasant company. You could almost call them clients, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Clients?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Young  girls are curious.” Shion shrugged and smirked. “I’m saying too much,  though. Suffice it to say that a reliable source told me everything I  needed to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “You really are scary sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  good. It means I’ve already won.” Shion smiled innocently. “How did  things go, though? Apparently you looked quite close…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blushed. “It’s all fine. Nothing you people need to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  Aren’t you going to go on about how wonderful your new girlfriend is,  and how totally in love you are?” Amiki folded her arms. “That’s a  tradition or something, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sarcasm aside, Rivera-san has a point.” Shion sighed theatrically. “I was looking forwards to all the juicy details.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you can spread rumours?” Kaname demanded. “Yeah, right…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks  like you worked me out.” Shion chuckled. “Of course, telling me might  work in your favour, all the same. There will be rumours, regardless,  so they may as well be factual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re together and we’ll see how things go.” Kaname snorted. “What else is there to say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll quote you on that.” Shion gave her a satisfied look. “Short, to the point and dramatic. I like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  sighed. “Honestly, I don’t think someone who missed the bus and packed  a few days with angst so thick you could have cut bricks out of it  before driving herself has any right to drama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Oh, come on. Does it matter that much? At least <em>I </em>got there in the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki held up her hands, leaning back. “You took your sweet time of it. That’s all I’m saying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa frowned. “Certainly, you’ve changed, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  aren’t you the same?” Kaname pointed out. “You’re sitting at this  table. If we go back far enough, I’d have every reason to hurt you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  I have every reason to hurt you back,” Olesa observed, tapping her nose  pointedly. “There are better places to live than in the past. That’s  something I have come to understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Now who’s being dramatic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning, everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  turned, closing her eyes. “You’re almost late again, you know? Just  what kept you this time? She can’t be that interesting-” Amiki kicked  her in the shin, and she opened her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane gave them a neutral look, her eyes lingering on Kaname. “Good day to you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good day,” Shion replied. “This is an unexpected pleasure, Ohtori-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa blinked, looking surprised. Amiki just stared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  coughed. “Well, you know Olesa, and probably Amiki too. This is Shion  Tomori-senpai, and… well… you probably know Kaname as well. Everyone,  this is Amane Ohtori. I guess you know that already, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane inclined her head politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, you should sit down… but we don’t have enough chairs, do we?  Give me a second, I’ll take one from another table…” Momomi turned and  hurried away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname watched her go, and became aware of the atmosphere. <em>How  would I put this? It’s intense and oppressive. This is a silence that  goes beyond a lack of words, even further than an awkward silence, into  something that emphasises sheer pressure. It’s rather like being caught  in a collapsing mineshaft or a submarine crushed fifty thousand meters  below sea level. </em>She looked around. <em>But the most pressing and  obvious comparison would be that this is exactly like receiving at  least sixty confused and vaguely hostile stares at once, from every  side of a large room we’re in the middle of. Yeah. This is that kind of  silence. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here. Sorry for the wait.” Momomi put a chair down and stood back awkwardly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane sat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  tried to bite her tongue, but Momomi collapsing into her chair amidst  some aggressive staring was pretty provocative. “So… what are you here,  anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “It looked interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sixty fascinated, puzzled, irritated, bemused, jealous stares focused on them from all sides.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… good,” Kaname managed lamely. <em>Great. Breakfast with a rival I hate, just in time for a lynching from her mob the moment she leaves. Just great…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, we’ve been talking, Kiyashiki-san,” Shion noted. “We’re very pleased for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s been spying on us again,” Kaname observed, sighing. “It’s troublesome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spying  is such a harsh term,” Shion noted. “I hear things, that’s all. But  I’ve told you that many times before, and you didn’t listen to me then  either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can’t say I’m surprised,” Momomi replied. She snapped her chopsticks apart and began to eat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s annoying. I knew she was bad news from the start, but no, you had to make a pact with the devil…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  she’s paying for that by adapting my scripts,” Shion replied amicably.  “My information gathering is just an indication of how much I care  about you both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sort of caring is solid grounds for a restraining order, you know,” Kaname remarked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, you’re dodging the point in hand,” Amiki commented. “You two  are call cute and lovey-dovey now, as I’d anticipated since forever. I  still win.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname observed Amane out of the corner of her eye, wondering how the girl would react. She was completely impassive. <em>As infuriating as ever…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suspect that was just a random guess, though,” Momomi noted. “If you did notice before we did, though, all credit to you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,  what happened?” Shion asked. “When we last talked about this, she had  rejected you. Was she romantic? Flowers or chocolates?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. I could tell you…” Momomi smiled. “But won’t you have more fun guessing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  both damnably evasive,” Shion sighed. “Oh, well. I suppose you’re  embarrassed. But I fully anticipate all the awkwardness, mumbled words  and misapprehensions to be revealed in the fullness of time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname folded her arms. “That settles it. You were definitely hiding in the bushes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion laughed. “Well, never mind… tell me, Ohtori-san? Did Kiyashiki-san entrust you with any more information?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.” Amane shrugged. “She was glad, but that’s hardly surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too bad… why can’t my cute friends be open and enthusiastic about these things? It makes me feel like I’m missing out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That has to be a sign of control freakery,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just smirked. “And how is Isae-chan, senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isae?  Oh, she’s fine…” Shion looked flustered for all of a moment, then  recovered herself. “I’ve been telling her all about you two, you know.  She’s scandalised and fascinated in equal measure. Well, this may have  been a reason for her enforced exile from here, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?” Amiki frowned. “Is she prudish or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little. But I was referring to her parents. I’m speculating, she never  knew all of their reasons…” Shion shrugged. “But she wasn’t the only  child to leave in the year that Serané-sama and Kariya-sama became  Etoiles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “What’s wrong with… oh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  quite. One must admire the courage of the Superior and the Sisters, to  condone that particular democratic decision of the pupils.” Shion  closed her eyes. “But that’s all in the past now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course it  is.” Momomi leaned forwards. “More importantly, senpai, when was the  last time you gave Isae-chan all the details of our escapades? Last  night, perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only briefly,” Shion muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled. “Now, what did you say? We want to know all the embarrassing details.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was a quick call, because she was hoping that you’d have a happy  ending,” Shion replied, regaining her composure. “She doesn’t think  like her parents. I don’t know what her beliefs are, but for her  feelings… Isae was always someone who felt before thinking. An  empathetic girl…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The opposite of your calculating tendencies, then,” Amiki noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re being unfair,” Momomi observed. “Right now, the principle of feeling without thought is dictating what she says.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed theatrically. “Well, of course she wouldn’t be anywhere as  anxious if she knew you two. She didn’t like malicious people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, don’t get sensitive on us,” Momomi chided.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be hypocritical,” Olesa completed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane cleared her throat. “Who is Isae-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  blinked. “Oh, sorry… Isae is pretty much Shion’s roommate and crush  from back in first year. They lost touch ‘cause Shion chickened out of  calling but we teased her until she started talking again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  rolled her eyes. “I’m afraid I’m being misrepresented, Ohtori-san. My  story isn’t that exciting. At that age I barely knew what a crush was.  She was a friend to me, no more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A friend she spends hours on the phone to, at international rates,” Momomi remarked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Presumably having dirty phone sex. Yeah, I went there.” Olesa casually bashed her on the head, but Amiki still looked smug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  was a little tasteless, Rivera-san.” Shion smiled at Amane. “You’ll  have to forgive them, Ohtori-san. I’m not a very good senpai,  evidently, so their manners leave something to be desired. But they’re  charming, in a rough-edged way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane slowly looked between them. “Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” Amiki complained. “Don’t get all superior and talk as if we’re not here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  see what I mean?” Shion cocked her head, still smiling pleasantly at  the newcomer. “Well, I’m sure they’ll learn in the fullness of time.  Childhood is good as it is…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to kill you if you keep this up,” Amiki warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “And I’ll help her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, now, Isae-chan is a sensitive subject,” Momomi said lightly. “We should be more polite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa nodded. “I think it would be good if you apologised, Alicia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, Shion-senpai,” Amiki muttered. “But it’s all in fun, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t take me too seriously either,” Shion replied easily. “I’m thicker-skinned than that, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s good.” Momomi closed her eyes. “Always stay on the right side of the girl who could blackmail you, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly,” Olesa agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “You are all very eccentric.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed shortly. “You think? Well, you’re no different…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  she means is that we are weird, but it’s kinda fun this way, don’t you  think?” Momomi smiled. “Like Amiki said, it’s all in fun, even if it  looks like we’re ripping on each other horribly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Amane nodded. “Fair enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That reminds me, if she’s here, shouldn’t we go for her too?” Kaname noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know… what’s there to attack?” Amiki smirked. “We could talk  about her antisocial personality, but you three are pretty open to  accusations of hypocrisy on that front.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You two are no  different, though,” Momomi pointed out. “Before, you had three bad  friends used as proxies for your interesting activities. I would call  that antisocial, myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, now, don’t go scaring Ohtori-san off,” Shion said lightly. “Shall we keep the conversation relatively sane today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion smiled at Amane. “I’m glad. They’re very spirited.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “Ah. But actually, there was one thing I was wondering about…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that?” Shion asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  the antisocial, friendless weird senpai who hangs around with the lower  years for some reason, right?” Amane stated. “But this Isae is your  roommate? That means she’s the same age as you, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion closed her eyes and sighed. “Oh, my. You’re an awful lot crueller than even these four hellions…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The worst part of it is that you know that Amane-san always says exactly what she thinks,” Momomi noted. “Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. That’s normal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, it really, really isn’t…” Kaname leaned back, Amiki nodding in sage agreement.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But yes. That’s right.” Shion sighed. “She was in my year. We were <em>inseparable </em>friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So even someone like Tomori-senpai has a true friend…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion smiled weakly. “Please try not to sound so surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. <em>Strangely,  the crashing walls of human hostility have receded somewhat, leaving  only dust and silence in their wake. Wait, silence? </em>She looked around. “Oh, shit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname pointed. “First period starts in, like…” She checked her watch. “One minute, apparently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say  what? Damn, I haven’t even finished this!” Momomi crammed a few more  mouthfuls down her throat then stood and snatched up her bag. “It’s  cause you guys were distractin’ me…” she mumbled around her rice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damnit, why did no one tell us?” Amiki complained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Presumably they thought we knew what we were doing,” Shion replied reasonably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki snorted. “Hell, that’s another point. Why didn’t any of us notice exactly what time it was, either?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did,” Olesa and Amane stated simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You did?” Amiki asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why the hell didn’t you say anything?” Kaname demanded, less partisan than Amiki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shrugged. “I presumed you were aware.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is bad.” Momomi sighed. “We’d better run. I’ll see you guys later!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye. Remember, revision during lunch!” Kaname stood, brushing herself off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded hurriedly. “We should buy lunch together this time! Bye!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Goodbye,” Shion noted, trotting away briskly. “It was a pleasure talking to you, Ohtori-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, later…” Amiki grabbed the wrist of a lethargic Olesa and dragged her away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked at Amane, who looked back. “Later,” she said curtly, turning and walking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a few steps, Kaname turned irritably. “Why are you following me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then what the hell are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heading for my French lesson.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn. At the same time? I don’t know the timetable for that group. </em>“Shouldn’t you be running after Olesa and Amiki? You’ll be late, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So will you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  tried to grapple with this damaging retort. “Well, yeah, but do I give  a damn? Being late for French… give me a break. I could care less about  that stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes to herself. “What about you? Aren’t you the perfect one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let me rephrase that… aren’t you a hyper conscientious student who cares about her studies?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not especially.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  right…” Kaname folded her arms. “You think I’m stupid? You revise for  hours, get near-perfect test scores and turn in every homework on time  with high grades. Everyone knows that. I don’t think a cool, rebellious  attitude will really cut it in your case.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do the work  assigned to me to the highest standard, as expected of me.” Amane  closed her eyes. “That isn’t the same as caring about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph. Aren’t you expected to be on time, too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m also expected to be unruffled, calm and dignified.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Think a lot of yourself, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Amane shook her head. “But a lot of people think a lot about me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite the egotist. I guess someone like you considers yourself too good to run anywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane glanced at her, red eyes meeting. “But are you not the same?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really,” Kaname muttered, looking away. “Like I said, I just don’t care too much if I’m late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that mentality also a superiority complex?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly. I just have a sense of perspective, unlike you.” Kaname snorted irritably. “But thanks for the analysis anyway, Freud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t need to thank me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gritted her teeth, feeling irritated. <em>If  I hurried on to my lesson, I’d contradict myself, even if I’d lose her.  I could try slowing down to get rid of her, but that could backfire if  she imitates me and we both get to our lessons even later. Unless that  would prove that she’s noticed and cares about our dignities, relative  to each other…but if I moved or reacted at all to her presence, that’s  showing I’m being affected by her. I can’t do that. So I’m just stuck  like this…</em>She turned to regard Amane’s profile, feeling annoyed. <em>She’s seriously irritating.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The other blue-haired girl gave her a blank look, then looked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn. I really do hate her…quite apart from anything else, does she have to look like my long-lost twin? </em>Kaname scowled. <em>That reminds me…</em>“Yo, Ohtori.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shifted her head again, cool eyes focusing on her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is convenient, actually. I need to remind you of something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I remember everything you said,” Kaname continued. “Don’t play dumb. But Momomi’s mine now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is illegal to own a person,” Amane observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  fuck with me.” Kaname glared assertively at her. “I don’t know what you  were trying to achieve or what your feelings are, and I don’t care  either. But I won, game over, whatever… so don’t you dare touch her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “And if I do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll break your bloody face, that’s what.” Kaname snorted. “I don’t respect you, but I hope you have that much honour…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honour…” Amane chuckled. “If the situation was reversed, would you give up? Knowing your feelings?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I’m not a complete bitch, unlike someone I know…” Kaname replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just arced her eyebrows sceptically, then turned away in silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you serious?” Kaname demanded. <em>And I was beginning to wonder whether I’d imagined her psychotic moment…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I’m curious. That sounds like a weak emotion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Aren’t you <em>expected </em>to act within the bounds of the most basic human decency?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m expected to grow up and marry a boy from the Souh dynasty. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So? Do you expect me to cry over your riches?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Amane turned and headed for her classroom. “Good day, Kenjou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go to hell.” Kaname glared after her. <em>What the hell is going on in her head? Is she really going to carry on?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She opened her own classroom door. <em>If so, she really is mad…is that why she sat with us? Is she that cynical and calculating?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re late, Kenjou!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,  sensei,” Kaname managed, snatched from her thoughts. She bowed quickly.  “I forgot to pack the right books and had to run back to my room…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As ever, your organisation is a disgrace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m very sorry. It won’t happen again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish I could believe that… now sit down and stop disrupting my lesson!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname hurried to her seat in the back. <em>Good thing Amane isn’t in my class. I wouldn’t like her to see that. </em>She  sat and hurriedly pulled out her books, furtively looking at the  student next to her and turning to the right page in the textbook.  They’d already started an exercise, so she opened her pencil case and  selected a pen and ruler, hurriedly writing the date and title.  Finally, she relaxed slightly and read the question to hand. <em>Easy. I’ve already studied this for my first year exams…</em>She read for a few more moments, frowning slightly, then looked around furtively. <em>More  pressingly, it’s as I thought. The demonic walls have been resurrected  by the malignant genius loci of the abandoned hospital and are pressing  in on all sides, newly-powered up and radiating killing intent. Which  isn’t bad for a dumb, mute bunch of second year schoolgirls, or so I’d  say if I didn’t know just how vicious and outright malignant they can  be…is this the end for me? After years of close-fought battles,  training and survival, am I destined to be crushed by the vice of  girl-love based jealousy and peer pressure?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Concentrate! I’ll be picking out random students to give the answers, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked. <em>The walls recede once more. Our heroine is safe for now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  now to more important matters, free of references to the cheesier  horror books I read. Nah, I can’t resist. The intelligent,  superficially charming but extremely suspicious person with red eyes  has smiled through her mask and uttered a cryptic yet foreboding  sentence…</em>Kaname scowled. <em>More seriously, though, this could be a  problem. I don’t understand what she’s getting at. Was it just a feint  to make me jealous? And now she’s just playing with me? Or does she  really mean to try and take Momomi from me? That would be a problem. My  record is crap as it is and it’d be damaged further if I became morally  obliged to assault her. It’s not like anyone would take my side in that  argument, not when it’s the perfect Ohtori-san against her known rival,  the delinquent Kenjou…god. Know I’m pissed off again. She could lie,  cheat, steal and sleep with Serané-sama behind Kariya’s back and still  come out smelling of roses. Of course, she’d then be killed by Kariya’s  sure and certain blade, but that just goes to show that I have to use  force. You can’t rely on the fairness of this world to be a punishment.  But I’m still back where I’m started. </em>Kaname finished writing and put her pen down. <em>Behold  the powers of multitasking! But I’m getting too worked up about this. I  can trust Momomi, right? Of course I can. If I can’t believe in her now  I’ll never be able to do so. So do I even need to hit anyone? Momomi’s  smart, she can handle herself. But I also have my pride, and I did  promise very clearly that I’d beat her bloody if she tried anything.  That’s a human reaction, right? This is a difficult situation, though.  I wish I knew her intentions. She thinks it’s so bloody cool to be  enigmatic, talking cryptically and acting like she understands  everyone! </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou! What’s the answer to part a?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname answered perfectly to that and several follow-up questions, smiling when the teacher gave up. <em>Even if I’m unprepared, you won’t catch me out with something this basic. You too, Amane. I’ll take everything you have.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  the lesson ended, she wasn’t surprised to see Yuho leaning over her  desk again. The girl looked more annoyed than usual, though. “Tell me,  Kenjou. Just who is Kiyashiki with? You, or Ohtori-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked up. <em>Shall I play with words, or not? No point, I suppose. </em>“With me. Definitely. We’re going out on Saturday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Yuho said, apparently disinterested. “So how on earth did she get Ohtori-san to sit with you people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Who knows? Does it matter!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course it matters! This isn’t normal.” Yuho snorted. “Ohtori-san won’t  socialise with anyone, whether they bully her, beg her or bribe her.  You should know, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, but I don’t care.” Kaname  stood, feigning disinterest with the conversation. She wasn’t unaware  of several people watching them, however. “Who gives a damn about how  cold she is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone like you shouldn’t say things like that,”  Yuho noted distastefully. “But there has to be a reason. Why is she so  interested in Kiyashiki, come to that? She’s just plain weird…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up.” Kaname glared. “The only weird thing here is your morbid  fascination with an aloof bitch too good to spend time with you people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  protective girlfriend? How cute,” Yuho retorted, completely unfazed.  “But I’ll restate it. She’s weird, you’re weird, and I’ve no idea why  Ohtori-san would condescend to talk to either of you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  plainly she finds us more interesting than you,” Kaname remarked,  walking past her. “She must be even weirder than we are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho followed her, folding her arms. “Pretty cocky, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. But if you don’t understand, ask Ohtori-san. I hate fangirls trying to worm information out of normal people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I hate bigoted, antisocial obsessive loners,” Yuho retorted. “We can still have a dialogue, can’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see no need for one. Go bug Amane. That’s all I have to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets and sped up, but Yuho followed her doggedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell did she talk about, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  I get it. Your beloved Ohtori-san wouldn’t say anything if you talked  to her directly, so you come bugging me.” Kaname snorted. “Am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  answer the damn question, Kenjou,” Yuho snapped. “Your attitude problem  is why you don’t have any friends but a loner freakshow anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  snapped her head ground and glowered, pointedly pulling her hands out  of her pockets. “Piss off, or your nose will need resetting in three  places.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho sighed. “Yeah, yeah, friends are sacred… you don’t  give a damn about Ohtori-san, do you? So we both cut the attitude, you  give me the answers and we can both get on with our lives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. You’re talking to the wrong person.” Kaname turned away and walked on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since when did you care about Ohtori-san?” Yuho snorted. “Aren’t you her obsessive-compulsive rival?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hate her, certainly. But I hate people like you rather more. Go talk to  Tomori-senpai if you insist. She’s kinder than me.” Kaname smirked.  “But I doubt she’ll tell you shit, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho sighed. “You’re still an obstructionistic, friendless psychopath, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you’re still a rumour-mongering, fixated stalker.” Kaname adjusted the  set of her bag on her shoulder. “Some things don’t change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You and Kiyashiki-san, though? I’m surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you, you suck at being an observant stalker.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  the lack of potential. I meant that someone as stupid as you wouldn’t  recognise your own feelings if they brought you a whipped-cream  breakfast in the nude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled slightly. “Evidently, I  have more courage than someone who just watches everyone else, then  goes to bug them about what happened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, enjoy your time with Kiyashiki-san. Whatever you two are going to do…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Enjoy stalking Amane.” Kaname sighed as she walked into the Geography classroom. <em>To be honest, she’s not too bad. She’s better than the ones who just glare and don’t say anything, at least.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But she asked one good question. Why the hell did Amane want to talk to us, anyway?</em></span></p>
