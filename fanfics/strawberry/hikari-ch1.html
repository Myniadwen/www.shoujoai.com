<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  Notes: This story was slightly inspired by the ending theme “Hikari”  from Fate Stay/Night Episode 14. If you have the track I suggest  playing it while reading the story.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  title was originally Love Letters. But when I heard this song and saw  the title, it seemed to fit the story I had in mind. Note: that the  lyrics I’m using is directly taken from the episode that was dubbed  by Eclipse fansubs. I cannot say that it’s perfect, as I don’t  speak Japanese very well (just the basics and even then I’m still  sort of bad XD). This is slightly a song fic thanks to this song.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also  I’d like to dedicate this story to a special someone who changed my  life. You’ll know it’s you when you’ve read it. And I’d like  to say this to that person: <em><strong>“Thank  You. I love you.” </strong></em></span></p>

<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>(That  day, we went… our separate ways…)</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-----------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  returned to her singles dorm room. It was Ootori Amane’s two years  ago, she had traded her room to Yaya to be with Hikari. She had been  living alone there, ever since Hikari and Amane won the Etoile  elections over a year ago. She had pretty much given up on Hikari’s  affections. Giving it her best effort to let go of her feelings and  desire for Hikari. It was hard for her the first few months and she  occasionally broke down and cried, with Tsubomi at her side. Yaya  never asked her to be there, but she never asked her to leave either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  strove to get over Hikari, she had quitted the Saintly Chorus after  joining the Kendo Club. It wasn’t easy, but the hard physical  training helped her keep her mind away from Hikari. A year later…  Nanto Yaya, The Raven Blade, was making legends in the Kendo world.  Her talents didn’t stop at singing it seemed; she excelled in her  studies becoming an honor student, she became athletic and  competitive, she painted, she played the violin, and was almost  recruited by the Horse Riding Club… which she humbly declined.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">During  that year, her contact with Hikari was barely a Etoile –  Scholar/Champion/Artist basis. They were both busy, Hikari had her  Etoile duties and she had her new responsibilities. Occasionally  someone would invite everyone over in Nagisa or Tamao’s room for  one of their Midnight Tea parties. It was difficult for everyone the  first time… It took them nearly half a year to begin being  comfortable around each other again, being that Hikari was  Etoile-sama, Nagisa had realize Tamao’s feelings and Yaya had just  quit the choir. They all felt a little awkward here in there. But  they were somehow able to put up a farce. Yaya, for the first few  months acted like nothing was wrong. She teased everyone and messed  with everyone like she had done so before. Eventually, her  personality changed… she had become a much more mature and gentle  woman, despite her passion and ferocity when it comes to Kendo and  Athletics. Such meetings stopped eventually, no one could remember  when or why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  had later become Spica’s “Enchantress” a name given by Lulim’s  Newspaper club, after publishing a special edition about her which  included a huge number of love letters the Newspaper club found Yaya  throwing away. The Newspaper club was punished by their school and  was almost forcefully disbanded for publishing the love letters  without the consent of the writer. Had Yaya not written a letter in  response to everyone’s letter and had it published by them. She had  written that her honest feelings at the time, or at least she thought  she was. She had told them all; that she was happy that they felt  that way about her. But she was not ready to love anyone, yet…  again. Her fans and admirers understood somehow, but still sent her  letters and gifts time and again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Today  was one such day… her bag has been half filled with letters and  gifts. To her surprise there was a big box inside her room filled  with gifts, letters and flowers. There was so much that she had  stopped responding to anyone of them, especially when she realized  that replying made them send more. She remembered that Amane, “The  ex-Prince of Spica” who graduated last year, didn’t accept gifts.  She realized why she did so, after the first month she received so  many. But she just didn’t have the heart to decline them so openly  like Amane did years ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  even though she never replies to the gifts anymore she liked reading  them. She was intrigued by the creative ways and words the girls  chose, to express their love or admiration for her. One such letter  came as a Katana with the love letter was engraved on the length of  it’s blade. She was impressed, it even came with its owns stand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I’m  keeping this one.’</em> She  thought happily and set the gift aside with the few things she likes  keeping.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a few dozen letters, Yaya spots a yellow box tied with a blue ribbon.  She opens it and finds a beautiful wooden music box. She opens it but  it doesn’t play. She found a letter engraved inside its lid.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya,</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I'm  sorry if this is of any inconvenience to you.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  key to wind this music box is still with me.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  have something I must tell you…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Would  you meet with me in the church?</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Any  day you are free is fine...</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  will be waiting…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  read the contents of the letter. She was sort of impressed, the  engraving had been done by machine but she was more or less sure that  someone had hand written the letter first before the machine had  engraved it on the metal. The music box held her favorite color, red.  She began to wonder why, did the sender keep the key. Other than  making her come which was a bad idea, after all she could just  discard the thing and not care about the sender like she had done  with hundreds of other gifts. She also began to wonder about the  sender. She didn’t leave a name. And unlike most if not all the  previous letters she had received this one did not address her with  her full name or even an honorific… just Yaya. She was getting  curious. But she wasn’t about to give in. Instead she decides to  just keep the music box until either she actually decides to go meet  this person or the key comes later.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was tired. She had just arrived from a Kendo tournament with her team  later than expected. It was passed curfew too surely the sender won’t  be there today. <em>‘Why am I  thinking about it? It’s just a music box. But who could it be…?’</em> Those were Yaya’s thoughts before she succumbed to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>A  month later…</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-----------------</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>ima  no boku wa donna fuu ni iiwake wo sureba iinodarou</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>(what  kind of excuses should I come up with now…)</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-----------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  had not thought about the music box after that. She had projects to  complete and kendo practice to keep her mind busy. The last thing on  Yaya’s mind was who sent her that box.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Konnichiwa!  Yaya-sempai!” Yaya was eating her lunch, when a certain pink haired  underclassman greeted her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!  Tsubomi-chan. How are you?” It wasn’t unusual for Tsubomi to be  seen around “The Enchantress” though it was an envious sight for  a lot of Yaya’s fans for a while. Tsubomi after all had been at  Yaya’s side ever since Hikari had become Etoile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  fine. But I still have a lot of run ins with some of your fans.  Either they’re telling me to stay away from you or they’re asking  me stuff about you.” She lightheartedly told her. Tsubomi had gone  from being a worriedly annoying to a more relax friend close of Yaya.  If anyone would probably ask, Yaya would tell them that Tsubomi is  her best friend. Despite the past tension between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  laughed softly and very ladylike as her underclassman tells her the  antics of her Fans.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  the way… I’ve been meaning to ask you for a while. Why did you  cut your hair Tsubomi-chan?” Tsubomi no longer had the long  straight hair that she used to have. Instead her hair had a rather  rough boyish cut, which oddly reminded her of “The Prince of  Spica”, Amane’s hair style. Yaya could remember that Tsubomi had  her hair cut short soon after the Etolie Elections and had kept it  that way for quite a while now. Until now Yaya never asked her about  it, but for some reason she thought now seemed a good time to ask.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t cut it because of a lost love if that’s what you mean.”  Tsubomi retorted, instinctively being as defensive as she was two  years ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  couldn’t help but softly giggle as she notices Tsubomi’s blush.  “That didn’t even cross my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi  blushed even harder, realizing that she had actually confessed the  reason for her cutting her hair. She scowled and pouted childishly at  Yaya for being a mean tease, even though she might not have meant to  do so. The both knew, they both had fallen for the same girl. They  didn’t say it when they cried together. But they knew for certain…  that they did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  just smiled at Tsubomi admiring the beautiful young, if slightly  boyish and childish, lady that she had grown into. She had become the  star of the Saintly Chorus after a year of dedication. Yaya rarely  misses her concerts. Rumor has it; if Nanto Yaya was going to become  Etoile. She would most likely choose Okuwaka Tsubomi as her partner.  Though the two don’t seem to be romantically involved, everyone  believes if Yaya chooses or is convinced to join the Etoile Elections  this year, Tsubomi is the one girl everyone believed she’d ask.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two separate ways after lunch exchanging soft a “See you later”  and a wave as the parted. Tsubomi has all but forgotten the  embarrassing event earlier with Yaya. She actually misses the days  where Yaya teases her to no end.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Classes  went smoothly for Yaya today. It was Friday, and luckily one of the  days she has off from all her activities. She returns to her dorm  room wanting to give herself a bit of time to relax in privacy. As  she leaned on her table she notices the Red music box she had gotten  a month ago. She puts a hand on the box, opens it and reading the  letter engraved inside again.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’ll  be waiting…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  be waiting… huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  emptily looked at the engraving, as she sat on her desk chair. She  held her face on her palm and almost boringly starting staring at the  box for a while. She looked at the clock. It was still early. But it  had been almost if not a month over since she had gotten this. If she  actually went to see this person it’s almost like checking to see  if she’s going to wait for her. She had originally decided not to  answer anymore letters.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think I’ll go to the church to pray a little…” She closes the  music box and heads out of her room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Taking  the scenic route towards the church, this was to avoid seeing anyone  on the way, namely her fans. She had learned to appreciate the nature  that surrounds their campus thanks to them. She was sort of glad that  her fans haven’t noticed her sneaking into the forests to get her  way around and at the same time oddly disappointed that they haven’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  church was empty when she arrived.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So…  miss “I’ll be waiting…” where are you now.” She mockingly  whispered to herself. She approached the altar slowly, recalling the  many memories that the church held for her. The Saintly Chorus, Her  victory celebrations, the Etoile Election, friends…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">While  waiting for the sender. She walked around inside the church, parts of  it that held even the tiniest of memory. She slowly found her way to  the church’s back garden; it was her special place two years ago,  she stood there for a while… reminiscing, thinking, enjoying the  cool breeze that gently caressed her skin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari…”  She whispered. She recalled memories of her ex-best friend. Their  meeting, their times together, her warmth, her softness, her voice,  her smiles, her tears… She thought that she was over her… that is  at least since last year, she thought was over her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was silent for a while, contemplating on what to do. The one who sent  the box wasn’t here. And she had no real business here. It felt  like the times she hid away to ditch school and choir… being  somewhere with no real purpose. And with no real purpose almost out  of whim she began to sing:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em><strong>kedakaki  yuri no shiro no gotoku…” (Like the white of a sublime lily,) </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  her surprise a familiar voice sings the next line from behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em><strong>fushigi  bara no rei ni no gotoku…” (like the spirit of a mysterious  rose,)</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  turns in surprise and comes face to face with former Etoile, Saintly  Chorus member, Roommate, and Best friend… Konohana Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  was speechless she had not seen Hikari in person for quite a while  now. It was fine… for her cause anyway. The more distance she had  with Hikari, the more likely she was to sooner or later let go of her  feelings. Or at least that was what she believed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked at the blond girl. Her deep blue eyes distracted Yaya from  noticing the soft blush that formed on her cheeks. Hikari had gotten  taller as well, she was almost as tall as she is now. She had this  air of confidence with her now, she was no longer that cute girl in  the choir… two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  smiled, softly at her. Trying her best not to show the feeling of  uncertainty that began shadowing her heart, the moment she saw  Hikari’s soft blue eyes.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-----------------</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>kakushikirenai  yowasa kanji yamikumo ni tsumazuku tabi ni</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>(I  sense an in concealable weakness, and every time I suddenly stumble…)</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-----------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  thought that my heart has forgotten all about you…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya’s  voice was like her eyes… shaking. She was very near tears but she  tried her best to hold it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  finally came… Yaya.” Hikari said in a high soft and sweet voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  was surprised. “Finally?..” she asked with a bewildered look in  her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  nodded and blushed. “I’ve waited for you to come here for quite a  while now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…waited?”  she curiously repeated… <em>‘Was  she the one who sent me the music box?’</em> Yaya asked herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since  when…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  looked away, her blush deepening its crimson shade. “About a year  now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see…” Yaya sounded disappointed. She wasn’t at all thinking why  Hikari was coming and waiting for her at the church for a year. Her  mind, in that instant was distracted by the letter in the red music  box.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  saw the sad look on Yaya’s face and almost faltered. She had made a  vow to herself: and that was to never hurt Yaya again. From her eyes,  Yaya was happy now. She is popular, talented, intelligent, athletic…  the last thing she needed in her life was for someone like her to  make her heart suffer again. That was why she probably declines  everyone who tried confessing their love to her. But deep in her  heart, she wished that Yaya still loved her. Like Yaya had before.  Now that she realized the pain of loving someone that might not love  you back and not realizing what you’ve had till it’s gone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  only wanted to see her again… hear her voice again… which was the  reason she kept coming to this church each and everyday. She knew  that Yaya wouldn’t come here on her own, this place held so many  painful memories for her… Hikari knew that much even if Yaya has  never said it. But still she went everyday… hoping, wishing,  dreaming of the day she’d come.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stood there in silence for a while. Neither of them knew what to say  to each other, Yaya especially. She had not truly meant to separate  herself from the blond girl this much. She had been hoping that she  could still be her best friend. But that wish died the moment she  stepped out their shared dorm room. Nothing was the same, she had to  cope somehow… or go crazy, which was a much more appealing and easy  option at the time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  should get going…” Yaya said to her softly and began to walk  towards the exit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Things  have changed so much, we’ve changed so much… I love her. I have  to let her go.’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  caught Yaya’s hand, to both their surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari?...”  Yaya stopped and looked at Hikari, beginning to feel disoriented.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  don’t deserve you… after what I’ve done…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  looked at Yaya, hesitantly. Her lips quivered at sight of the watery  glow of Yaya’s amber eyes. She softened her grip on her hand and  slowly taking steps to close the gap between them. Her free hand  shook as she reached for Yaya’s waist, lightly tracing her  enchantingly wondrous curves. Causing Yaya to blush and whimper at  the soft touch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi…Hikari?...”  Yaya looked at Hikari, mystified by the gentle air of desire that  enveloped the blond girl. She allowed Hikari pull her towards  herself. The feeling of helplessness enveloped her. Her Kendo skills,  her athletics, her pure physical advantage over the once timid blond  didn’t register at that moment. Or maybe deep inside her, she just  didn’t want to escape from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  bodies touch, both girls could feel the other’s warmth and couldn’t  help but be lost in it. Their eyes never once broke contact, until a  tear began to fall from Yaya’s eye. She turned her head to hide it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  looked at Yaya. She didn’t care anymore… her desire was stronger  than her resolve.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan…”  Hikari muttered in a tearful voice. Hikari’s reuse of the honorific  caused Yaya to look at her again. Her eye’s few open in surprise to  see… to feel… Hikari’s lips on her own.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-----------------</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>ano  hi no kimi toiu sonzai ga kono karada wo shimetsukeru</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>(Your  existence from that day, strangles this body…)</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-----------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>She’s  kissing me…!’</em> Yaya  thought as her mind was in panic ordering her to get free and run  away, from the blonde girl telling her she’s suffered enough… but  her body was in ecstasy at Hikari’s feathery touch, the lingering  wish to feel and hold Hikari for the past two years held her where  she stood. The small desire she had to run away was sooner lost as  Hikari’s light arms seized her from behind. She felt lost, between  love and her desire not to hurt again. Yaya didn’t move, she just  stood… or tried to remain standing. She didn’t reciprocate the  kiss. Her heart felt like it was being strangled slowly being crushed  by love and fear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>she’s  not kissing me back… I guess I should have expected that…’</em> A tear fell from Hikari’s eyes when she closed them as she slowly  broke the kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  let go of Yaya, even took a step back. And mentally prepared herself  to apologize for what she had just done. But before she could… she  hears a soft thud and ruffling of the grass. Opening her eyes, Hikari  found Yaya sitting on the ground, eyes opened and flowing of tears  with a slightly flushed but blank stare on her face. Her mind  initially assumed the worst, that her ex-best friend found it  painful… that her kiss either brought back bad memories or that she  had someone else in her heart now… She instinctively knelt and  began apologizing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan!  I’m sorry! I…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Yaya wasn’t thinking that all…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What  does that mean… that kiss… that feeling… she loves me? ...’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em><strong>So  what if she loves you now?!’</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  see… Hikari loves me…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em><strong>You  don’t love her anymore!’</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>That’s  not true…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘…<em><strong>?!’</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  still love her…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… didn’t  mean to… AH!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  before Hikari could finish… Yaya placed her arms around her and  pulled her close and held tightly to herself. Hikari felt afraid for  flickering moment. But that was soon over when she saw Yaya’s teary  eyes, welling up with love, desire and forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi…Hikari…Hikari!  I’ve waited so long… I love you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  then captured her lips, returning her kiss… and allowed three years  worth of unrequited love to flow with every touch, every breath and  that one long heartfelt kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>She  still loves me… after all the pain I’ve given her…’</em> Hikari inwardly apologized to Yaya for the pain she had put her thru,  and promised to herself that no matter what, she was not going to  make Yaya regret what she had just selfishly made her say just now.  Hikari wrapped her arms around Yaya once again. Regretting the two  years she had deprived herself of her love. She slowly but just as  passionately begins to return Yaya’s warm and heartfelt kiss.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Neither  knew how long their third kiss lasted nor who broke it. Unlike the  first which was one sided for Yaya and unlike the second that was one  sided for Hikari, the third kiss felt like their real first kiss. No  one knew who broke it, and neither cared… there were lots more  chances for them to share even better ones later. They didn’t speak  for a while. Instead they enjoyed each other’s warm embrace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was nearing dusk, curfew was close. But for some reason neither found  it a reason to head back just yet. Yaya happily lied down and rested  her head on Hikari’s lap as she sat on same part patch of grass  they kissed on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan,  what made you come here?” asked the blond as see playfully traced  Yaya’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  music box.” The raven haired vaguely answered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  music box?” Hikari disappointedly but curiously asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  the music box’s sender asked me to come here… about a month ago.  Now I regret not coming sooner...” Yaya answered, trying badly not  to shiver at Hikari’s touch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was  it a red music box?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  nodded. “How did you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  received this about a month ago.” Hikari showed her a key like wing  pendant. “It came with a letter, saying that the one with a red box  will some here someday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So…”  Yaya blushed, realizing that they were more or less tricked into  meeting each other again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hai?...”  Hikari asked brightly and mischievously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Yaya just blushed harder, realizing that she wasn’t used to seeing  Hikari’s cute face anymore. “Iie, it’s nothing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  change a lot Yaya-chan… You’ve become quite tame. It’s usually  me that blushes.” Hikari muttered softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  giggled softly at some memories of Hikari blushing, and mostly  because of her teasing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…  Time does that to people…” Repeatedly glancing away from Hikari  to somewhere else in the church feeling her heart beat faster each  time her eyes laid themselves on the blond girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>You’ve  change so much yourself Hikari…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  smiled and let a soft content giggle escape her lips as she traced a  heart on Yaya’s chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s  hope time doesn’t apply for us here. Ne? Yaya-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  needed no answer, at least not vocally. Hikari’s smile grew when  Yaya clasped her hand with hers and kept it on her chest, letting  Hikari’s pulse guide the beating of her own heart. Finally she was  truly happy…</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  by the door inside stood Tsubomi, who had seen every moment of her  two favorite Upperclassmen shared just now. She sadly smiled, happy  that their lonely and unrequited love had finally come to an end  there... Yet sad that she had to suffer it twice… She began to walk  away taking slow soft steps so as not to disturb the two. She decides  to tell the sister that Hikari and Yaya-sempai got held up with some  work and might be late.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  should call Amane-sempai tomorrow...”</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>End?</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes: I wrote this as a break from the drama in Yaya’s voice. And  to be honest I’m running on caffeine and adrenaline right as I’m  finishing this. So it may not be as good as I willed it when my brain  was functioning at full efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also  I'd like to state that, I'm only making up that Yaya is incredibly  talented as you may have noticed that too in my other fic Yaya's  Voice. I do not know the extent of her talents, but it makes a nice  juicy story huh? And also about her favorite color I don't know if it  is red. But she wears red a lot in the series... so I assumed it was  that and red is my favorite color. XD</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anyway  I hope you liked it. It’s slightly OOC though I believe. But it  made me feel all “WAFFY” and even had tears in my eyes almost  every time I reread it when I edited, so yeah… I’m satisfied.</span></p>
