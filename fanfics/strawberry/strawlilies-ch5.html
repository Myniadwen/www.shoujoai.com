~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lucky Kiss

      The rain was coming down hard, and Kizuna could clearly see it 
banging against the window of her dorm room.  It was a brazen reminder 
of how bored she was.  She hated being trapped inside.  The fresh air 
was so much nicer.  But only if she was with her friends.  If she alone, 
it was no better than being trapped inside because of rain.  Fresh air 
was especially nicer when Kizuna was with her&#133; 

      Kizuna sighed heavily and lay back on her bed.  She then turned 
her head and could just barely see the small potted lily on her desk.  
Ever since Kagome had received that one lily from Nagisa, the blonde 
girl had begun growing her own lilies and giving them away to her 
friends.  The original lily, the one Nagisa had given Kagome, had grown 
more beautiful; even though it had been several months, there wasn&#39;t 
even a hint of wilt on that lily. 

      Kizuna wondered if a lily given to the one she loved like Kagome 
loved Nagisa would be just as beautiful.  Friendship lilies were pretty 
and all, but ones nurtured by romantic love were special. 

      Of course, if Kizuna did try to grow lilies, she&#39;d be pretty lucky 
if she managed just to produce a bud.  

      The door opened and Lemon walked in, carrying a bowl of 
strawberries.  &quot;Hey,&quot; she greeted, a wide smile on her lips.  The dorm 
room was quickly filled with the pleasant aroma of strawberries. 

      &quot;Hi,&quot; Kizuna replied, sitting up.  The smell of those strawberries 
was making her hungry.  &quot;What&#39;s up with the strawberries?&quot; 

      &quot;Chikaru-sama gave them to me,&quot; Lemon answered, walking over to 
her desk and setting down the bowl.  &quot;Apparently the cafeteria ordered 
too many, so they&#39;re being given out to the students.&quot; 

      Kizuna stretched her arms and then planted her hands firmly next 
to her sides.  &quot;There&#39;s been so much interests in strawberries lately.  
I wonder why.&quot; 

      Lemon chuckled.  &quot;Well, our dorm is shaped like a giant 
strawberry.&quot;  She paused for a second.  &quot;Hey, do you have three cups?&quot; 

      &quot;What?&quot; was Kizuna&#39;s immediate reaction.  What a strange request, 
she thought.  If Lemon wanted a drink of something, she would only need 
one cup, wouldn&#39;t she? 

      &quot;You don&#39;t have any?&quot; Lemon assumed when Kizuna gave no further 
reply.  The smile began to fade from her face. 

      &quot;I do, I do!&quot; Kizuna said quickly.  She hopped off her bed and 
then got down on her belly to rummage underneath her bed.  &quot;Ah!&quot; she 
sounded when her hands landed on an unopened bag of disposable white 
cups.  She pulled them toward her, and once they were in the light, she 
stood up.  &quot;Here you go,&quot; she said, handing the bag to Lemon. 

      Disbelief was clearly visible on Lemon&#39;s face.  &quot;Under your bed?&quot; 

      Kizuna shrugged her shoulders.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong with that?&quot; 

      Lemon blushed brightly.  &quot;Nothing, nothing!&quot; she said in a squeaky 
voice.  She opened the bag of cups and pulled out three.  She placed 
them down next to the bowl of strawberries and then tossed the unused 
cups onto her bed.  &quot;I want to play a game with you,&quot; she began. 

      &quot;What kind of game?&quot; Kizuna asked.  Playing with Lemon would be a 
great way to relive her boredom.  She couldn&#39;t be anything but happy 
when she was with Lemon, after all. 

      Lemon picked up a strawberry out of the bowl and hid it under one 
of the white cups.  She then put the other two cups also in a standing 
position.  &quot;I&#39;ll shuffle the cups and you have to pick out the one 
that&#39;s hiding the strawberry,&quot; she explained to Kizuna. 

      &quot;Sounds easy,&quot; Kizuna remarked, stepping closer to the cups. 

      &quot;Then let&#39;s play!&quot;  Lemon&#39;s hands started quickly to move the cups 
around.  Sometimes she moved one forward and counter-clockwise, and 
sometimes she moved one backward and clockwise.  Her movements were 
almost lightning fast, so Kizuna found it increasingly difficult to keep 
her eyes focused.  She wouldn&#39;t normally take such a silly game 
seriously, but she believed that winning would certainly impress Lemon. 

      Suddenly, Lemon stopped.  &quot;All right, pick one,&quot; she said, smiling 
sweetly. 

      &quot;Um&#133;&quot;  Kizuna raised her hand, and after a moment of hesitation, 
pointed at the cup in the middle.  Lemon lifted it up and sure enough, 
the strawberry had been underneath. 

      &quot;Lucky!&quot; Lemon exclaimed cheerfully.  &quot;You get to eat the 
strawberry now!&quot; 

      &quot;Yum!&quot; was Kizuna&#39;s response.  She picked up the strawberry and 
put it into her mouth and began chewing.  It was a deliciously ripe and 
juicy one, she noticed. 

      Once Kizuna had swallowed the strawberry, Lemon said, &quot;And now for 
your other reward.&quot;  She leaned over and kissed Kizuna on the lips. 

      To say Kizuna was surprised was an understatement.  Lemon wanted 
to share kiss?  The last time they had kissed, Lemon hadn&#39;t seemed 
pleased at all.  But then again, Kizuna had only kissed Lemon that time 
to win the thumb-wrestling match.  This time, the kiss was devoid of 
sneaky tactics.  It was all so clear to Kizuna now.  She wouldn&#39;t have 
to learn how to grow lilies to earn Lemon&#39;s love, she thought happily.  
Just as Lemon said, she was &quot;lucky.&quot; 

      When the two girls pulled apart, Kizuna declared it was her turn 
to hide the strawberry, and Lemon had no objections to that.  There were 
plenty of strawberries left, and they would continue playing until they 
were all gone and maybe even longer than that.</pre>
