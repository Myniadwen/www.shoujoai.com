<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 6 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ninemil.html">ninemil</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;So the three of you have no idea what this outburst was about? You&#39;re 
certain of that?&quot;

The three girls in the Dormitory office bowed their heads. Stood before 
Sister Mizue they remained silent, trying to avoid the Sister&#39;s 
scrutinizing gaze as she looked them over one at a time. The Sister 
watched them intently for a few moments more, her attention focusing on 
Shizuma as the former-Etoile stared at the wide wooden desk in front of 
her. Next to Shizuma stood Amane, the Spican Etoile looking worn, her 
face shadowed with worry and concern. To her left was the distraught 
looking Yaya, tear stains still visible on her cheeks, her eyes red from 
crying and rubbing them sore.

The Sister sighed, and sat forward in the high backed chair behind the 
office desk. Her tone a little softer, she remarked,

&quot;I appreciate the strain and pressure the position of Etoile carries. 
It&#39;s completely feasible that Konohana-kun has simply fallen victim to 
that, and as she insists on withholding the details of whatever brought 
her to such distress, I can only presume that this is the case.&quot;

&quot;However,&quot; and with this, the Sister&#39;s tone shifted again, her gaze 
straying primarily to the silver haired Miatorian, &quot;if it comes to my 
knowledge that someone has inflamed this issue, be it with inappropriate 
behaviour or with the supply of illicit substances or alcohol, this will 
certainly become an issue for the school board.&quot;

Watching as Shizuma continued to stare at the floor, the Sister pressed 
the issue,

&quot;Shizuma, we all understand the ordeal you&#39;ve endured during the past 
two years,&quot; and with this, Shizuma lifted her gaze defiantly, &quot;however, 
we&#39;ve made numerous concessions for you since Sakuragi-san&#39;s death, 
turned our eyes to things that would usually have resulted in severe 
reprimand and disciplinary. I don&#39;t know what happened while the four of 
you were away this weekend, but given your irresponsible behaviour of 
late, your disruptive and undesirable antics, I would hate to have to 
question your position here at Astrea so close to your graduation. Don&#39;t 
give me reason to contact your parents again.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s face remained blank, and she nodded curtly, replying,

&quot;No Sister.&quot;

With that, Sister Mizue addressed the three girls together,

&quot;I would remind the three of you that this is a Christian school; that 
we abide by the word of our Lord, that we uphold the bible&#39;s teachings 
as well as providing an environment in which to teach our students and 
help them attain their potential. Whatever it is that some of you seem 
to think is acceptable will stop here and now. I will not tolerate 
students treating this school&#39;s traditions with such open disdain.&quot;

&quot;Yes Sister,&quot; the girls replied in unison.

The grey haired woman sat back in her seat, and with a dismayed tone she 
finished,

&quot;Since Konohana-kun has maintained her wish to rejoin her parents, she 
will be retiring from Astrea until the end of the winter break. 
Accordingly, her position as Etoile will be suspended and the artefacts 
of that position retained until she returns.&quot;

She looked at Amane this time, the sullen looking fifth year openly 
distressed by the words she&#39;d just heard as she stared at the floor.

&quot;I understand the implications this holds for you Ohtori-san; if you 
feel unable to continue the role of Etoile alone, or that the strain 
will compromise your school work, you must approach myself or your 
personal tutor immediately and we will discuss alleviating the issue.&quot;

Amane nodded, not really hearing the words but knowing she had to agree 
to something politely, her mind very much somewhere else entirely.

With that, the Sister stood.

&quot;If either of you remembers something, anything that could explain this 
incident, I want you to tell me immediately. The staff and I are less 
than comfortable leaving this issue open, and this is the first time in 
Astrea&#39;s long history that one of our students has actively requested 
leaving campus. We are not happy at all.&quot;

The girls nodded again.

&quot;You may go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Sister,&quot; came the chorus, and their pace polite, the girls 
turned and left the office, Yaya&#39;s eyes pooling again as she hurried 
down the corridor towards her room.

- - - - -

Amane sat leaning against the brick pillar that flanked the steps to the 
high green house table, her head resting against the rough surface, her 
brown eyes staring blankly at the paving stones below her. Somewhere 
behind, Shizuma quietly prepared a tray of tea, wrapped up in her own 
thoughts herself.

The former-Etoile carried the drinks over to Amane, resting them on the 
stones next to the top step. Curling her black Miatorian dress under 
her, she sat beside the Spican Etoile, her gaze following that of the 
sullen figure next to her.

&quot;If it helps, you don&#39;t need to worry about this place. I&#39;ll make sure 
it&#39;s taken care of over the winter.&quot;

Amane nodded vacantly, and without shifting her gaze she replied,

&quot;That would be appreciated, thank you Shizuma.&quot;

The former-Etoile reached for Amane, resting a hand on the fifth year&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for your pain Amane; I&#39;m not sure what to say.&quot;

Amane turned her head gently, looking at the hand on her shoulder. She 
placed her own on top, dipping her head again, letting her dark hair 
fall forward to cover her face.

&quot;What have I done Shizuma?&quot;

The Miatorian upperclassman frowned, saying,

&quot;This wasn&#39;t your fault Amane...&quot;

The Etoile raised her eyes, staring out across the green house,

&quot;Wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

She considered the months past, the days at the paddock, the many 
mornings riding Star Bride when the tiny blonde third year had stood 
under the tree near the railings, always watching, always present. But 
never coming forward, never saying hello.

It was Amane who had closed that gap, Amane who had pursued in 
curiosity,

&quot;She came to me with big eyes full of admiration Shizuma, with a heart 
of gold and that beautiful face full of innocence.&quot;

A tear sprung to the tall Spican&#39;s eye,

&quot;And what did I do? I assumed, I decided. I took it for something that I 
was looking for, read my own needs into those eyes.&quot;

Shizuma sat silent, letting her friend finish before replying,

&quot;I never forced her Shizuma, please, I never made her - &quot;

Emotions washing over her, Amane broke, the tears rolling across her 
face, guilt piercing her heart. Shizuma tried to offer comfort,

&quot;No one will think that Amane. Everyone knew how Hikari felt about you. 
No one else was there when Yaya told us what had happened, and I&#39;m sure 
Yaya will want it kept those things to herself.&quot;

Amane continued sobbing, her head hung in shame. Unsure how to react and 
never having seen the Etoile cry before, Shizuma awkwardly placed her 
other arm around the Spican, pulling the fifth year against her.

Amane shrugged the hug off, sitting up on the step.

&quot;This is my fault,&quot; she reasserted, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have involved myself 
with someone so young. It was wrong.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s face took on an exasperated look, struggling to find words to 
console her companion.

&quot;Amane - &quot;

The Spican continued,

&quot;I should have ruffled her hair and sent her on her way. I shouldn&#39;t 
have encouraged her the way I did.&quot;

Shizuma cut in, taking control of the conversation,

&quot;Hikari was so adamant in her affection for you Amane, no one would 
blame you for taking that the way you did.&quot; Then holding her hands out 
in testament, she added, &quot;Jesus, I&#39;ve done it enough times myself. And 
I&#39;m certain, honestly certain that deep down that&#39;s how Hikari truly 
feels for you. I&#39;ve seen it in her eyes. She was just shocked by what 
she walked in on.&quot;

Amane&#39;s tears slowed, and she looked at the Miatorian on the step beside 
her.

&quot;You&#39;re an iconic figure within Spica Amane. Girls of all ages look up 
to you, cheer for you on the track, support you at competitions. They 
even write your name in hearts on their school bags. But how many come 
to you the way Hikari did? How many display the same longing that she 
did.&quot;

Shizuma took the Etoile&#39;s hands in hers, looking directly into Amane&#39;s 
eyes.

&quot;She loves you Amane. She does. She&#39;ll come round, she just needs some 
time.&quot;

Amane looked back silently, then after a moment she replied,

&quot;Thank you Shizuma.&quot;

Shizuma continued to hold Amane&#39;s gaze, then certain the Etoile was calm 
again, she released the Spican&#39;s hands, turning and taking the tea cups 
from the tray. Passing Amane her&#39;s and wafting the scent of the sweet 
red tea across her nose, she added,

&quot;If anyone should be feeling guilty right now it&#39;s me. I shouldn&#39;t have 
given her so much to drink.&quot;

And then, after having taken a long sip, she added,

&quot;And Yaya. Jesus, I&#39;ve done some stupid things in my time admittedly, 
but in the Cathedral...?&quot; she shook her head. &quot;I know they&#39;re both 
young, but god what were they thinking?&quot;

Amane had returned to gazing across the colourful plants below her, 
letting the steam from the tea warm her face.

&quot;I guess there&#39;s some truth to love being blind,&quot; Amane added ominously, 
&quot;We become so self-absorbed, so selfish. Blind to other people&#39;s 
feelings, blind to their perceptions.&quot;

And as the girls sat there in silence, Amane sad and regretful, her 
heart longing for her tiny Spican companion, Shizuma found herself 
thinking of Miyuki.

- - - - -

It was late when the car came to collect Hikari. Despite the rumours 
running rife, no one had been allowed to wave her off, Sister Mizue 
honouring the young Etoile&#39;s request that she be left alone, that she 
didn&#39;t want to see anyone before going.

Through the first floor window of their shared Dormitory, Nagisa and 
Tamao watched as their Spican friend climbed into the car without a 
single glance over her shoulder. Sitting back in her seat, she stared 
forward, expressionless as the tinted black window drew closed, hiding 
her from view altogether. As the car pulled away, the girls drifted away 
from the window, their hearts low, Nagisa nagged by a continuing sense 
of guilt.

Why she hadn&#39;t also been dragged into the Sister&#39;s office she was 
unsure, but she felt responsible in some way all the same, certain that 
the previous night at the summer house had some part to play in the 
afternoon&#39;s unrest.

&quot;It seems that whenever I go to that place, something always goes 
wrong,&quot; she said, holding the key around her neck.

&quot;Part of me wishes Shizuma had never taken me there.&quot;

Tamao looked across the room from her place sat on her bed, her hands 
clasped in her lap and a sad look on her face,

&quot;I can&#39;t imagine Nagisa-chan could have anything to do with this. Hikari 
seemed fine all afternoon, I doubt it&#39;s related.&quot; Then thoughtful, she 
added, &quot;except perhaps at that shop. She was acting very strangely when 
Amane-sama tried that dress on.&quot;

Nagisa sighed, feeling depressed and tearful. She fiddled with the green 
clip holding her hair up before removing it, letting the auburn locks 
fall loose. Holding her brush out toward Tamao she asked,

&quot;Would Tamao-chan brush my hair for me?&quot; She dipped her gaze, adding in 
a quiet voice, &quot;It always makes me feel better.&quot;

Tamao looked at the brush for a moment, an expression on her face that 
Nagisa couldn&#39;t read. Then with a suddenly chirpy reply, Tamao stood and 
took the brush,

&quot;Of course I can. Anything for my Nagisa-chan.&quot;

She sat Nagisa down at her desk, hands on the fourth year&#39;s shoulders as 
she looked at her friend in the mirror. Then, after smiling and ruffling 
the flowing locks, she began brushing her room mate&#39;s long red hair out 
in slow sweeping arcs, holding collected bunches in her other hand,

&quot;Nagisa-chan still doesn&#39;t take enough care of her hair. One day it will 
all fall out and she&#39;ll wish she&#39;d listened to me.&quot;

Nagisa smiled weakly and then sat in thought, staring at the desk in 
front of her. After some consideration she quietly asked,

&quot;We were all so eager to see them together. Do you think we pushed her 
too hard?&quot;

Tamao looked back at the fourth year in the mirror.

&quot;What does Nagisa-chan mean?&quot;

Nagisa turned the words over in her head before replying,

&quot;We were all so certain they were just being shy. Were we really doing 
what was best for them, or just trying to force what we all wanted to 
see?&quot;

Chewing her bottom lip, she looked at the desk as she continued, her 
words trailing off with awkward self-awareness.

&quot;I mean, how normal is it for two girls to feel that way about each 
other anyway?&quot;

Tamao&#39;s face flushed for a second, but she did her best to hide it and 
dipped her deep blue gaze to avoid eye contact, pretending instead to 
concentrate on brushing.

&quot;But they look wonderful together as Etoile?&quot; Tamao replied, knowing 
that wasn&#39;t the point. Nagisa then said as much in her reply,

&quot;That&#39;s not the same Tamao-chan.&quot;

She continued,

&quot;She never talks about Amane-sama the same way I do about Shizuma. She 
never looks at her in the same way. And when Amane was wearing that 
dress, she looked like she&#39;d seen a ghost, even though Amane-sama looked 
very pretty indeed.&quot;

Tamao stood quietly for a moment, knowing exactly what Nagisa meant and 
mulling something over. There was a personal insight she wanted to 
share, something she felt might explain Hikari&#39;s behaviour but was 
completely unsure of the consequences of doing so.

So much had happened between her and Nagisa these past few months. They 
weren&#39;t the same together anymore, their friendship having changed so 
much in the run up to the election, let alone afterwards.

She might still understand though, perhaps.

With an odd tone in her voice, the fourth year asked,

&quot;If I were to tell you something, does Nagisa-chan promise not to tell 
Shizuma-sama?&quot;

Nagisa looked up in surprise, regarding the dark haired girl in the 
mirror.

&quot;Tamao-chan?&quot;

&quot;Promise me Nagisa,&quot; Tamao repeated.

Nagisa paused, her eyes questioning. Then realising Tamao wasn&#39;t going 
to give any ground, she nodded slowly in agreement,

&quot;Oh... uh, I promise...&quot;

Tamao took a deep breath, her brushing subsiding into idle motions as 
she recalled past events. She was still very unsure as to how wise it 
was to say this.

&quot;The morning after Yaya&#39;s tea party; the one after the election, I came 
back to the dormitory while you were still asleep.&quot;

Nagisa nodded, recalling,

&quot;Shizuma told me you were in the shower when she woke up,&quot;

She offered another meek apology,

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry we got Tamao-chan in trouble.&quot;

But Tamao was quiet, still debating whether to continue. After a moment 
more, she finally set her resolve.

&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; Tamao explained, &quot;I was... here for a while before 
using the shower.&quot;

She waited for a response, fearing Nagisa might openly object to the 
invasion of the couple&#39;s privacy. But when no reply came, the red head 
still waiting silently before her, Tamao continued her story.

&quot;I stood watching you asleep together, for a while. You were holding 
each other tightly.&quot;

Nagisa blushed slightly, knowing the couple had slept without any 
nightclothes and feeling embarrassed by the thought of Tamao seeing them 
naked. Noting the response, the older upperclassman quickly gathered her 
thoughts, shifting her weight slightly as she tried to get to the point 
as fast as possible, attempting to avoid any further awkwardness.

She started again matter-of-factly,

&quot;From the first moment I saw her in the infirmary; it struck me how cute 
my Nagisa-chan was,&quot;

She smiled fondly as she reminisced,

&quot;Her pretty smile, those big excited eyes, and her amazingly coloured 
hair,&quot; and as Tamao mentioned it, she found herself laying the brush to 
one side, instead running her fingers gently through the soft red 
strands before her. There was a wistful look on to her face, and she 
paused again.

&quot;So very pretty...&quot;

Tamao sighed and tipped her head, continuing on,

&quot;But that morning in the dormitory, seeing you both together like 
that...&quot;

Her words trailed off and she swallowed gently, passing the auburn 
strands between her fingers, feeling the texture, the warmth.

&quot;Um...&quot;

Her thoughts sidetracked, Tamao&#39;s explanation stalled. For some reason 
the feelings of repulsion and the uncomfortable pit in the bottom of her 
stomach that she&#39;d felt that morning when she&#39;d seen the couple together 
weren&#39;t returning. She&#39;d wanted to vocalise them for Nagisa&#39;s benefit, 
to try and help her understand the look on Hikari&#39;s face at the 
department store. But instead she felt her skin flush, her finger tips 
acutely aware of each strand of hair, each flowing lock.

Nagisa&#39;s skin was so warm, her presence so immediate, and as Tamao 
pushed the young woman&#39;s hair back from behind her right ear, she caught 
sight of the dainty earring Nagisa wore, felt the smooth skin of the 
fourth year&#39;s neck brush against her palm. Lost in the moment and the 
physical sensations that began to overwhelm her, she tried clarifying 
her point, failing miserably in her distraction,

&quot;I found myself wondering how it would feel being next to you like that, 
to be lying naked against my Nagisa-chan.&quot;

Nagisa shifted uncomfortably, overly aware of Tamao&#39;s gentle touch, the 
red head feeling slender fingers gliding across the back of her neck.

Tamao&#39;s eyes were distant, thoughtful as she played, reliving the 
encounter and reprocessing the feelings with a fresh mindset. Nagisa 
quietly watched the upperclassman in the mirror, anxious and unnerved by 
Tamao&#39;s behaviour, even more so given her body was beginning to react to 
it.

Only Shizuma should be able to do this...

The raven haired upperclassman was lost in her thoughts, lost in the 
deafening crash of sensations. She couldn&#39;t shake the preoccupation, 
couldn&#39;t escape the smell of Nagisa&#39;s sweet conditioner, the warm glow 
of her perfume. Idly her fingers worked lower, out across the unsettled 
fourth year&#39;s gently curving shoulders.

It was only when she saw the expression on Nagisa&#39;s face in the mirror 
that Tamao caught herself, pushing the past memory aside to concentrate 
solely on the now.

Nagisa was staring back at her, huge bottomless pupils wide, her face 
flushed, her expression like open book waiting to be read. As Tamao 
looked on she could see the red head visibly reacting to Tamao&#39;s touch, 
seeing the same feelings written on her roommate&#39;s face that were 
responsible for the warm glow she felt within herself. As the 
upperclassman brushed her fingers back across her classmate&#39;s slender 
neck and shoulders, Tamao watched as goose bumps formed on the red 
head&#39;s skin, saw the shift in Nagisa&#39;s eyes. Holding her gaze, Tamao 
felt their breathing fall into sync, the dark haired Miatorian watching 
with a delicious sensation coursing through her as Nagisa became more 
and more self-aware, her own unexpected arousal unnerving her as much as 
Tamao&#39;s did.

This wasn&#39;t right, Nagisa panicked, this was supposed to be something 
special, something she was only supposed to have with Shizuma... Why can 
she make me feel like this?

Absolution hit Tamao in a single moment of clarity. Suddenly the young 
woman understood. Suddenly she knew why she&#39;d been alone so long, why 
she&#39;d been singled out as a junior.

The young woman&#39;s voice almost trembling, Tamao continued in an almost 
inaudible whisper,

&quot;It felt so wrong at the time,&quot; she said, dipping her eyes in shame,

&quot;I&#39;d never seen two girls together, not like that. I felt so very 
uncomfortable.&quot;

But when she looked back at the mirror, staring straight at Nagisa&#39;s 
reflection, she held the brown eyes peering back firmly, her glance 
questioning and direct.

Surely Nagisa felt this too. Surely she understood.

But the red head remained silent, motionless before her.

Tamao panicked, suddenly conscious that she needed to justify the 
intrusion, needed to make her point properly.

&quot;The way I felt back then, the knot in the pit of my stomach; when I saw 
Hikari&#39;s reaction at the department store I was reminded of that.&quot;

The pair remained static for a moment longer, unspoken signals passing 
between them as Nagisa pensively searched the subtext and Tamao 
scrambled her mind for the original message she&#39;d wanted to impart.

Her face flushed, her body screaming in objection, the raven haired 
Miatorian turned away, letting Nagisa&#39;s hair fall idly as she walked to 
sit on the bed behind.

She was shaking, her thoughts clouded in fog.

&quot;I...&quot;

She looked back at her room mate, the fourth year still sat motionless 
beside her.

Another sensation began to dominate at the back of Tamao&#39;s mind, nagging 
at the base of her stomach.

&quot;Perhaps um...&quot;

She shook herself mentally, forcing herself to regain composure.

&quot;Perhaps something happened between them, and, um...&quot;

Again she stumbled. Giving up, she cut the awkward conversation short, 
realising she&#39;d gone too far, knowing she&#39;d crossed the mark.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, perhaps something like that happened between them and 
that caused this afternoon,&quot; she finished, washed by defeat, fully aware 
that her story had made no sense whatsoever.

Nagisa, still sat rigid at her desk, uneasy with the sensations coursing 
through her and the person responsible for creating them, tried to catch 
Tamao&#39;s gaze in the mirror.

Failing to, she asked in a small voice,

&quot;And... is, is that how Tamao-chan still feels now?&quot;

But Tamao sat silent, looking at the window, acutely aware of what she&#39;d 
just done. Her thoughts in disarray, her tummy twisting into a knotted 
ball, she remained silent, her reply not forth-coming.

- - - - -

&quot;How long has Ohshibaru lived with Kagome-chan?&quot; Chikaru asked in her 
third attempt at provoking a response from the tiny first year as she 
worked.

Kagome remained silent, perched on the end of Chikaru&#39;s bed, holding her 
legs up around her and resting her head on her knees. She looked sullen 
and tired, the morning&#39;s ordeal leaving her even more withdrawn than 
usual.

Chikaru sighed softly, her face drawn with concern as the needle and 
thread in her hands weaved back and forth, working their magic as she 
thought of more avenues by which to approach the sullen figure sat with 
her.

It hadn&#39;t been long after the screaming underclassman had been 
discovered by a Miatorian fourth year that Chikaru had been called; the 
school council President the usual point of call for dealing with 
problems regarding Lulim&#39;s students. Noting the identity from the 
description given to her by another Miatorian girl who&#39;d run to 
Chikaru&#39;s room, she&#39;d hastened to collect the young brunette, concerned 
for Kagome&#39;s well being.

Kagome in one hand, teddy bear in the other, Chikaru had led the sobbing 
first year back to her own room, where having sat her down and prepared 
her a still neglected cup of hot chocolate, Chikaru had set about 
repairing the damage to Percival&#39;s arm. The issue of Chiyo&#39;s behaviour 
could be dealt with later, and more appropriately, by President Rokujo.

Chikaru&#39;s room was a veritable Aladdin&#39;s Cave, filled with the products 
of Chikaru&#39;s active imagination and her amazing creative ability. 
Stuffed toys, puppets, artwork including paintings and hand drawn 
portraits, costumes and clothing littered the room, hung from every 
available hook, shelf and draw handle. Her clothing was the highlight 
and the industrious fifth year had a promising career in fashion ahead 
of her; no one looked better dressed out of term than she did.

She considered the collection of stuffed toys across her pillow; 
teddies, tigers, kittens, cows and sheep, each with a name and a 
history. She nodded at one of the two white tigers that lay near 
Kagome&#39;s hand.

&quot;Do you see that kitty cat next to you Kagome-chan? Her name is Shiva. 
She&#39;s been living with me for almost five years now. I made her the 
first week I started at Lulim.&quot;

Kagome turned her head slightly, regarding the soft white toy, its fur 
patterned with black stripes, its ears fluffy tufts that looked 
incredibly soft.

&quot;She looked after me when I was little like you Kagome,&quot; the older girl 
said, &quot;she used to watch the door for me when I slept.&quot;

Chikaru smiled fondly, memories flooding back of her early years in the 
Dorms.

&quot;Does Ohshibaru look after Kagome-chan as she sleeps?&quot; Chikaru asked in 
a soft voice.

But the first year remained silent, her gaze returning to the wall and 
Chikaru&#39;s array of clothing.

Chikaru sighed, and quickened her sowing so she could return the bear as 
soon as possible.

- - - - -

Not long after Tamao had finished brushing Nagisa&#39;s hair, the unsettled 
red head had excused herself from the bed room, Tamao unwilling to 
elaborate any further on their conversation and Nagisa unable to remain 
in the awkward atmosphere. As she walked, her thoughts were drawn 
elsewhere; a friend from her corridor having knocked to tell her that 
Shizuma had been seen with Yaya and Amane outside the Dormitory office. 
The shouting match she&#39;d over heard through the Dormitory walls that 
morning also played on her mind, and she opted to find Shizuma for both 
comfort and explanation. She&#39;d not seen the silver haired sixth year 
since she and Amane had raced off from the green house when one of the 
Spica girls had appeared with the news that Hikari had been taken to the 
infirmary.

Unable to find Shizuma anywhere else, she headed back to the green 
house, unwilling to try Shizuma&#39;s room directly for fear of bumping into 
Miyuki.

An unwanted flush still persisted across her face, making her feel dirty 
and ashamed, unsure why her own body would so openly disobey her.

As she trudged through the snow towards the Etoile&#39;s hideaway, her mind 
flicked back and forth between the day&#39;s events, producing a mixture of 
confusion, dismay, anxiety and jealousy.

Tamao had never spoken like that to her before, never touched her like 
that; in the time before the election, whenever Tamao had suggested an 
interest in her, it had always been through teasing or playful jest. 
She&#39;d never acted so serious, nor been so forward in her approach. It 
left Nagisa unsettled to know that her room mate had considered her in 
such a raw manner, that she&#39;d invaded the couple privacy and spied on 
them together. And surely, surely she shouldn&#39;t have been able to 
conjure these feelings within her.

Only Shizuma should be able to do that.

Nagisa pushed away a lump forming in the back of her throat. Had Tamao 
felt that seriously about Nagisa, how was it now that she was making 
such an effort to accommodate Shizuma? Why was she pretending to be so 
accepting?

It made no sense to the fourth year.

She felt betrayed, and not just by Tamao. By herself too.

And then there was Miyuki. What had they been up to? Was Miyuki lying, 
or had Shizuma really tried kissing her the day her term as Etoile had 
ended? Did Shizuma really mean the words she&#39;d said that night in the 
green house when she took the key back? And more importantly, was she 
about to change her mind yet again having consumed Nagisa&#39;s heart so 
totally since.

Nagisa knew losing that love now would destroy her.

She sighed, and for the first time in over a week, she felt doubtful and 
scared again.

Perhaps it was just losing Hikari&#39;s smiling face from the school, the 
thought that something so terrible could have happened to the pretty 
third year that left her so desperate to leave Astrea. Perhaps it was 
just Miyuki&#39;s stirring. Perhaps it was just a bad day or the late night 
and the alcohol the previous evening and Nagisa would feel fine 
tomorrow.

She didn&#39;t know. She pushed on, confused and uncomfortable, unable even 
to make sense of her own body and the messages it was giving her, but 
knowing that right then, what she truly needed was to be held by 
someone, and by someone who wasn&#39;t going to run away and leave her the 
following day or undermine her securities unexpectedly.

She hurried on, the green house not much further.

- - - - -

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot; Tsubomi&#39;s voice quivered as she took in the sight before 
her, pea green eyes wide in shock and her mouth hanging open.

The dormitory Hikari and Yaya shared looked as though someone had turned 
it upside down and shaken it; bed covers, ripped pillows, books, clothes 
and paper lay strewn across the room. The linen curtains hung from the 
railing above the window in tatters, long gashes across them and rips 
where the missing curtain rings had been. The wall mirror above Yaya&#39;s 
desk had been smashed, the glittering shards strewn across the desk and 
nearby floor. Even the ceiling light lay scattered in pieces.

As the strawberry haired first year closed the door to the third year 
Dormitory, she caught the sound of the shower, although the door was 
wide open and the light inside was switched off. Hesitantly, she crept 
her way across the debris to peer inside, broken glass and plastic 
crunching under her feet.

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot; she called again, tense with apprehension, unsure of what 
she would find.

The bathroom was so dark that at first, she couldn&#39;t make anything out 
within. Then as her eyes adjusted, she could see Yaya&#39;s huddled figure 
curled up against the back wall, sitting on the tiles underneath the 
shower. Her clothing and hair were soaked, water running in torrents 
down her skin as the shower ran endlessly over her. Hugging her shins, 
Yaya stared blankly towards the open door. There was no expression in 
her eyes, her lips parsed and her face drawn. Tsubomi realised the third 
year was shivering, and reaching forward to touch her she flinched, 
freezing cold water splashing across her hand, the shower having run so 
long it had emptied the hot water tank.

Panic caught the Tsubomi, and she pulled at Yaya as icy water splashed 
over the underclassman&#39;s shoulders and head. Stretching up, she slammed 
the tap with her hand, shutting off the stream. With an effort, she 
managed to get Yaya onto her feet and help her stumble out into the bed 
room.

She took the dark haired Spican to one of the beds, sweeping the mess 
lying on it across the floor before helping Yaya sit down. She flicked 
her own damp hair from her face and knelt before her girlfriend, looking 
into Yaya&#39;s dark eyes, desperately trying to get some recognition. Yaya 
just stared blankly, her skin&#39;s pale tone more obvious in the light of 
the bedroom. Tsubomi tried to steady her fingers as she struggled in 
vain to undo Yaya&#39;s shirt buttons to remove her sodden clothing so she 
could wrap something warm around her, but a combination of nerves and 
adrenaline got the better of her. In the end, she simply threw her arms 
around the sodden figure before her, dragging a blanket around the pair 
of them for insulation.

They sat there for what seemed like ages, the only sounds being that of 
the dripping shower head and Tsubomi&#39;s heart pounding in her chest. 
Blinking back salty tears, Tsubomi cradled the third year lovingly, 
stroking her long black hair and whispering to her that everything would 
be okay.

After a while, the cold began to leave Yaya&#39;s skin and the shivering 
stopped. Eventually she stirred in the first year&#39;s arms, tipping her 
head to rest it on Tsubomi&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Yaya-chan, what have you done?&quot; Tsubomi mumbled, looking around the 
room as she gently moved the older girl&#39;s head into the curve of her 
neck. She sat there, stroking Yaya&#39;s hair, rocking the pair of them back 
and forth.

Scared, lonely and desperately trying to be strong for both of them, 
Tsubomi sat in the dormitory, waiting for Yaya to come to her senses, 
watching the sun begin its slow decline through the window.

- - - - -

The heavy scent of the flowers filling her nose, Nagisa walked along the 
rows of trellis tables on her way to the centre of the green house, her 
thoughts still a jumble of intrigue, self-doubt and envy. It was getting 
late, and through the glass ceiling she could see the sun beginning to 
set. It would soon be time for dinner, and if Amane wasn&#39;t going to be 
present to give grace, and given Hikari&#39;s hurried departure from the 
school an hour ago, Nagisa found it unlikely that Amane would, then she 
knew she would have to be at dinner in case it was Sister Mizue that 
took the Etoile&#39;s place. That woman had an eye for everything.

Nagisa stopped in her tracks as she reached the bottom step of the high 
table area. What was that? Her heart jumped as she realised she could 
her someone crying.

Bouncing up the steps she crossed the garden area to find Shizuma 
leaning against the back wall, her arms wrapped around herself, head 
down, gently sobbing.

Nagisa crept towards the former-Etoile slowly, unsure of how to approach 
her. Nagisa&#39;s mind raced; scared she&#39;d done something to upset her 
girlfriend, even more scared that something horrible had happened to her 
as well.

&quot;Shizuma-sama?&quot; Nagisa whispered gently, only a few paces from the sixth 
year.

Shizuma choked back her tears, wiping her eyes as she looked up. 
Recognizing the face, she replied,

&quot;Nagisa. I&#39;m sorry, I...&quot;

Nagisa looked confused,

&quot;Shizuma-sama? ... What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she panicked, &quot;Did I do something to 
upset you?&quot;

Shizuma managed a fond smile, shaking her head gently,

&quot;No, of course not Nagisa.&quot; She reached her arms out for the young woman 
in front of her. &quot;I&#39;m just struggling with today a little, that&#39;s all.&quot;

But Nagisa didn&#39;t step into the embrace, skirting around the 
former-Etoile and taking a seat at the table instead. Shizuma lowered 
her arms slowly, a puzzled expression crossing her face as she returned 
them to her side.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong my love?&quot;

Nagisa fell silent a moment, holding her head, still mind still 
swimming. Lifting her gaze, she replied,

&quot;I just... I don&#39;t know. I feel the same way I guess. I...&quot;

Her voiced trailed off,

&quot;Today has been really hard, what with Miyuki, with Hikari-chan.

&quot;She paused,&quot;

&quot;With everything...&quot;

Her attention shifted and she pressed another subject, asking,

&quot;What happened with Hikari Shizuma-sama? Did she say anything?&quot;

Shizuma shook her head, still unsettled by the fourth year&#39;s reaction to 
her, but sharing events all the same,

&quot;No, we didn&#39;t see her. She was in the infirmary when we arrived. Yaya 
had been with Hikari so we talked to her for a short while before Sister 
Mizue dragged us into the office.&quot;

&quot;Did Yaya tell you what had happened?&quot; Nagisa asked, hoping to 
understand what had triggered Hikari&#39;s sudden desire to leave the 
school. She&#39;d heard rumours of the young Etoile lying in the snow 
outside the Cathedral, calling over and over for her parents. The image 
was disturbing.

&quot;Kind of.&quot;

Shizuma didn&#39;t elaborate.

&quot;Shizuma-sama?&quot;

The sixth year sighed, her face betraying inner conflict.

&quot;It&#39;s complicated Nagisa. Yaya didn&#39;t want anyone to know. She didn&#39;t 
even want to talk to Amane. What happened was... was.&quot;

She sighed,

&quot;It&#39;s difficult, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s eyes widened and her face took on a hurt look.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t Shizuma-sama trust me?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; Shizuma snapped. &quot;I can understand Yaya not wanting 
people to know, it&#39;s messy.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s heart dropped, and she pleaded,

&quot;But when did we keep secrets from each other?&quot;

Shizuma struggled with her frustration, and she replied,

&quot;It&#39;s not by choice. It&#39;s different.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s eyes narrowed, and she found herself mumbling,

&quot;Like it was with Miyuki?&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s face dropped, not expecting the comment or the tone by which 
it was delivered,

&quot;Nagisa?&quot;

&quot;Well!&quot; the red head snapped, pulling herself out of the chair, waving 
her arms open. &quot;When were you going to tell me? &quot;

Tears sprang to her eyes and she clutched her aching chest, &quot;Or was she 
lying? I don&#39;t understand and I&#39;m scared Shizuma. Scared Shizuma-sama is 
going to change her mind again and tell me to leave her like she did 
that night in here before the election...&quot;

She looked up in pain, tears racing down her cheeks,

&quot;Tell me Shizuma-sama still loves me. Tell me Miyuki is lying.&quot;

Shizuma stepped forward, tears welling in her own eyes, wrapping the 
fourth year up in her arms.

&quot;I do love you Nagisa, I do. You mean everything to me.&quot;

Nagisa sobbed in her embrace, gingerly returning it, hands curled up 
behind the former-Etoile&#39;s back, unable to let herself relax,

&quot;Then why Shizuma-sama? Why would Miyuki say those things if they 
weren&#39;t true? She doesn&#39;t lie, she&#39;s never lied...&quot;

Shizuma gripped the red head tightly, blinking back her own tears as she 
braced herself for the reaction she knew her words would bring,

&quot;Because she wasn&#39;t lying Nagisa.&quot;

The young Miatorian doubled as though someone had punched her, crying in 
dismay and pulling away from the former-Etoile.

&quot;Why would you do those things? Why if you loved me?&quot;

She stumbled backwards, trying to get some space to collect herself. 
Letting Nagisa slip away, Shizuma tried to find the words, searching for 
a way to explain,

&quot;It wasn&#39;t the way she made it sound Nagisa, please, let me...&quot;

Her mind reeled, and she tried to string events together,

&quot;She came to me demanding Kaori&#39;s necklace back. She was so cold, so 
uncaring,&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s voice quivered as she struggled to keep the train of thought, 
panic gripping her as she watched Nagisa&#39; face twisting in pain, scared 
to lose the girl she loved so dearly,

&quot;I told her she couldn&#39;t understand; that she&#39;d never loved someone like 
I had loved Kaori. She challenged me, telling me she had, telling me 
that she understood. She couldn&#39;t say anything after, she just stood 
there looking at me until I realised who she&#39;d meant.&quot;

The sixth year paused,

&quot;That she meant she&#39;d loved me...

Shizuma&#39;s voice was quieter as she continued,

&quot;I was so angry still, I wanted to hurt her so much.&quot;

She lowered her emerald gaze, guilt washing over her,

&quot;I wanted to punish her, make her feel the same pain I did.&quot; Cradling 
herself, Shizuma went on,&quot; so I gave her a taste of what I knew she must 
have longed for, for something she could never have. I made her take it 
from me that very moment, knowing full well it belonged to someone else 
and that it would never be hers ...&quot;

Looking back into Nagisa&#39;s brown eyes, she held her hands open, her face 
written in desperation,

&quot;...knowing that it belonged to you Nagisa.&quot;

Tears fell down the former-Etoile&#39;s face,

&quot;Would always belong to you.&quot;

Nagisa stared back, the gulf between them filled with longing, but the 
pain in her heart holding her back.

&quot;Promise me Shizuma, promise me.&quot;

The emerald-eyed sixth year buckled as emotions washed over her,

&quot;I can&#39;t lose you Nagisa, I can&#39;t lose you the way I did her. Please...&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s face twisted, the walls crumbling away, and then, finally 
succumbing she raced forward into Shizuma&#39;s waiting arms. They held each 
other there for a moment, before collapsing to their knees on the floor, 
slowly sitting as they kissed over and over again, trying to erase the 
pain, clutching at intimacy in the hope it would wash the hollow void 
away.

Shizuma held the fourth year&#39;s face before her, looking directly into 
the brown eyes staring back, cheeks shimmering with rolling tears,

&quot;I love you Nagisa, whatever may have happened in the past, I love you 
dearly. Nothing can change that.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s gentle sobs slowed, leaving only the sound of their breathing, 
the pounding of their hearts. Nagisa held the former-Etoile&#39;s gaze,

&quot;I love you Shizuma-sama. I love you so much. Don&#39;t ever leave me 
again.&quot;

And with that they gripped each other tightly, eyes closed, waiting for 
the pain to subside.

- - - - -

&quot;There, good as new!&quot; Chikaru proclaimed, holding Percival up in front 
of Kagome&#39;s blank gaze. To prove the point, she wiggled his repaired 
arm, smiling as she did.

Kagome continued to sit still for a moment, still holding herself. 
Eventually, gingerly, she reached a hand out and gently stroked the 
bear&#39;s head, feeling the soft texture under her fingers.

&quot;I think Kagome should give Ohshibaru a great big hug as she hasn&#39;t been 
able to all afternoon,&quot; Chikaru said, trying to lure the first year out 
of her shell.

But in a move that left the pretty Lulim senior bewildered, Kagome sat 
back, replying calmly,

&quot;Thank you Chikaru-senpai. Kagome-chan appreciates what you&#39;ve done for 
Ohshibaru, but I think it would be better if he stayed here. Perhaps he 
could help Shiva watch the door at night.&quot;

She lifted her deep green eyes to look directly at Chikaru,

&quot;I think that would be best. It&#39;s getting late now; Chikaru-senpai 
should come with Kagome-chan to the dining hall. It will be dinner soon, 
and Chikaru-senpai has worked hard all afternoon. She must be hungry.&quot;

Silenced by the tiny girl&#39;s words, Chikaru simply nodded in 
bewilderment.

And with that, Kagome took Percival from the school council President&#39;s 
hands, turning and placing him lovingly next to Shiva and Chikaru&#39;s 
other collected toys. She stroked his head, whispering in his ear,

&quot;You should stay here Ohshibaru, where these people will take care of 
you. Kagome-chan will miss you very much,&quot; and she turned to look back 
at Chikaru, &quot;but perhaps Chikaru-senpai will let me come and visit you 
from time to time.&quot;

Chikaru nodded, a soft smile forming on her lips,

Kagome looked satisfied, and then turned back to Percival, kissing him 
gently on the forehead. Then, without a second look, she walked to the 
door, taking Chikaru by the hand on the way, leading her off to dinner.

Alone in the paddock, Amane stood at the railing that ran the length of 
the track, a long blanket wrapped around her shoulders. She looked out 
across the valley, one arm holding herself, the other gently stroking 
the yellow scarf tied around her neck. Her eyes were red and sore, her 
face covered with tear stains.

Unashamed, she let the tears roll free, staring at the sun as it 
finished its final steps into the horizon, the sky a deep orange, the 
snow on the ground reflecting its warmth. It was like standing next to a 
giant fireplace, the glowing embers lighting the entire world around 
her; except no matter how fierce that fire was, it couldn&#39;t warm her 
freezing heart.

She stood there alone, her thoughts consumed with guilt, with loneliness 
and the compelling urge to contact Hikari; some how, in any way 
possible, just so she could hear the third year&#39;s musical voice again, 
see those gleaming blue eyes and have that beautiful smile beaming up 
fondly at the fifth year as she looked down.

Bowing her gaze, Amane whispered with quiet regret,

&quot;What have I done...&quot;
