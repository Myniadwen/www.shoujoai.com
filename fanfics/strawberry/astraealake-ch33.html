<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Behold, a dramatic resolution! Oh, yes... I'm good at those...</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Oh, god… oh, god… oh, god…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  folded Momomi into her arms, holding her tightly and letting her cry  into her shoulder. Her friend grabbed the lapel of her blazer with both  hands, holding on like it was her last grip on sanity, and just cried,  shoulders shaking, voice choking with the effort of trying to restrain  her tears. Kaname just stared dumbly at the opposite wall, caught  between rage and sorrow. <em>I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how  to react. I don’t know how to comfort someone. Momomi’s in pain and  I’ve no idea how to make her feel better, and it’s the most frustrating  thing in the world. Even worse, I know she’d know exactly what to do in  reverse. She’s the perfect one, and I’m clueless. </em>Her eyes narrowed. <em>But  I know one thing. I’m so angry right now that I swear I could kill.  That rotten, stinking bastard has cut Momomi to pieces, torn her apart,  shouted at her and made her feel this pain. I won’t forgive him, I  won’t forget this, and I will protect her. I don’t care how far I have  to go, I will protect her. That’s all I can do for her, and this wrath  reminds me of that. I’m make my body her shield and my anger a weapon,  and I’ll hurt anyone who hurts her. That’s who I am. </em>“I’ll kill him.” She spoke flatly, but her voice was full of barely restrained passion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you killed him… you’d go to jail… and I’d be very sad,” Momomi managed, still crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then  I’ll just beat him within an inch of his life. That’s fine as well.”  Kaname turned, supporting Momomi as best she could. “Now, let’s go  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How much did you hear?” Momomi asked belatedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Enough  to know that I won’t forgive him for what he’s said, in this lifetime  or the next. Someone like him has no right to life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re very… abrupt…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  not like I care about him,” Kaname said heatedly. “He’s nothing to me,  Momomi. As far as I’m concerned, there’s you and perhaps five other  people in my life. The rest can do what they like, and I’ll do what I  like to them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi just leaned against her, sniffing and trying to control herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  you want to, you can cry. You taught me it, there’s more strength in  showing your feelings than there is in hiding them away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  easy for you to say,” Momomi sniffed. “You never cry… you don’t know  how pathetic it is to feel like this. I feel wretched, low, weak,  useless… anyone who looks upon me will see me as all those things as  well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Who cares about them? The important people won’t think  that.” Kaname gritted her teeth. “But I don’t like myself for that,  either. When you feel so much pain inside you could just lie there and  die in life forever, but you can’t shed a tear, it’s not a happy  feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pulled out a handkerchief, dabbing at her eyes. “I guess…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Come on. Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>It  feels like I’m walking the wrong way. I should go back in there and  kick the shit of that bastard. That would be the right thing to do. No,  rather, that’s what would gratify my feelings… but I know that wouldn’t  make Momomi happy. </em>“You don’t really hate him, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked at her in surprise. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname trudged on, feeling Momomi clinging to her arm. <em>It’s a peculiarly distracting sensation. I guess this is what it is  to bear the weight of another’s sorrow. </em>“I can kinda tell… you have every reason to do so, but in the end, you don’t hate him. That must make it hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No,  I do hate him,” Momomi said quietly. “But I don’t have your conviction.  I wish I could burn with anger, like you. I always end up… just like  this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">People were staring. Kaname gave them a glare that clearly  indicated their existence was surplus to requirements. “No, I envy you.  Even with a father like him, you’re still a gentle person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  not like that. I don’t want to be so weak. I’m a bad person, but I  don’t have the strength to truly follow through with it, and that feels  awful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, you shouldn’t say things like that,” Kaname said,  turning and smiling at her friend. Momomi just stared back with  glistening eyes. “I know I really am a bad person, hateful and  short-tempered at some times and callous and cold at others. So I’ve  been counting on you to change me. If you say that you’re bad, that  means I really am awful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you talking about?” Momomi mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey,  hey, hey. Don’t make me repeat something that embarrassing.” Kaname  kept her tone light, but spared a particularly killer glare for some  girl in Momomi’s class who was walking hesitantly towards her. That  wouldn’t help. “But I won’t let you say nihilistic things about  yourself. There are plenty of people who would kill to have half your  talent and personality. Don’t expect me to tolerate you snivelling and  finding fault with yourself for no good reason!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled weakly. “You’re not good at unguarded compliments, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  you prefer it this way?” Kaname looked ahead. “I’m sure if I simply  flattered you without that you’d think I’d finally snapped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Actually… that’s true. It’s your way to be dishonest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Besides, you’re no better. That wasn’t even a half-compliment!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed, rather more than the comment was worth, but she needed some form of release, and laughter was a good one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>That’s  something I know. In this world, laughter can take away tears. Not  because laughter’s a wonderful healing force, it’s not. But when the  reality of this world’s too harsh, moving into the bounds of  incomprehensible nonsense and feeling that can distract you quite  easily. I don’t know what laughter is, but that’s how it works. It’s  better to live in a world that makes no sense at all than in a world  where a clear, terrible truth exists. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, don’t laugh at  me. I know when I’m being mocked, you know.” Kaname looked at her  friend with her best petulant pout, making her giggle some more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi wiped more tears from her eyes, shoulders shaking. “I’m so sorry, you know… no, I’m not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Impudent  child,” Kaname said, prodding her friend’s nose with her free hand.  “Someone with childish hair like that shouldn’t laugh at her elders,  you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled. “Well, forgive me, Kaname Kenjou-oneesama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now you sound like a fetishist! That’s just plain sama to you! Or dono, that works too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You really do have an inflated sense of self, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  pouted again. “There’s nothing inflated about it. I just know my place  in the world, which is near the top. So I’m damned if I’m taking any  lip from a plump doll-like kid, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This from the girl  who needs my help to get dressed in the morning? You’d fall apart  without me. More to the point, you’d attract birds with scarecrow hair  and stink like a pig in a shed. Full of excrement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  because I’m a great, important person that the world must revolve  around! You will respect my authority, damnit! I may not be able to  wipe my own arse but I pay people to do that for me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi chuckled again, catching on. “You’re certainly inconsistent, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Inconsistent,  me? Of course not, I’m always right. Sometimes what I said on Friday is  different from what I’m saying on Sunday, but I’m still always right.  I’m just <em>differently </em>right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So I can’t disagree with you, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of  course not. You might say something that makes sense, but if you’re  contradicting me then you’re just plain wrong. And people who are just  plain wrong don’t have any right to speak in my august presence!  Remember that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled again, slightly raggedly, as if  she was gnawing at a tree with sharp exhalations of mirth. “I’ll… bear  that in mind…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do you understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now, do you comprehend? Don’t you dare contradict me, I’m the person who’s always right!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi tried to keep a straight face, but ended up failing again. “You’re better at this than I’d have thought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What, being an egotistical psychobitch? Why, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, at comforting people. You don’t have to act for the other thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s another backhand compliment, isn’t it?” Kaname demanded. “What is it with you and them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Somehow,  they were already at their room. Kaname opened the door and pulled  Momomi through, closing it behind her. Then she walked Momomi over to  her bed and sat her down. The girl leaned on her shoulder again, and  even though she was smiling slightly and looked stronger than before  she still didn’t let go of Kaname’s arm. Which left the girl stuck  there, slightly awkwardly, and uncertain of what to do next. <em>To be  able to reply that well and laugh that freely after what she’s just  been through, Momomi really is amazingly strong. But she’s still  pained, that much is clear, and it’s fairly obvious why, as well. I  wish I could understand why she went so far. She didn’t have to pick a  fight and say everything she did; her own words hurt her, and his were  even worse, and she knew that would always be the way it would be. I  know her well enough myself to know that she can’t shout without  crying, not out of sadness, but because that’s how she displays her  high emotion. Either way, though, I know what comes after. That hollow  and angry and empty and exhausted feeling, where you can’t think of  anything else and everything keeps running through your head, what she  should have said and could have done, over and over, until you’re sick  of it and yourself and the world. It doesn’t become Momomi to think  like that. She should be freer, more innocent than that. I’ve made her  feel those things once myself, I’m not going to let it happen again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What’s up?” Momomi asked, sounding amused. “You’re spacing out on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname blinked and looked away. “Sorry. I was just thinking about something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s kinda embarrassing, you know, when you stare at me so closely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I was staring at you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  didn’t notice? Your head was close like this-” Momomi turned Kaname’s  head to face hers and tilted her own slightly, widening her eyes and  staring blankly at her friend. “And that’s how you looked. It was a bit  creepy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Like hell I looked like that. I never look that doofy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, if you won’t believe an eyewitness account, what am I to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If I look so bad, couldn’t you have taken photographic evidence?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not a stalker like someone we know.” Momomi smiled. “Besides, you wouldn’t have liked what it would have shown you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tush,” Kaname said, turning away. “A girl does a little thinking around here, and look what she gets for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you’ve stopped denying it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  confessing will stop you from becoming anything more Shion-like than  you already are, I’ll confess to anything.” Kaname scratched her nose.  “Except the invention of the skirt. I do have some standards.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Feminism again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t have an agenda here. I just fricking hate skirts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You must hate our school uniform, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Believe  me, I do.” Kaname looked at the ceiling. “When I grow too big for this  set, I’ll fold it and tuck it away neatly in the bottom of my draw. And  when that happens again, I’ll store it again, just like before, and so  on and on. And at the end of my time here, I’m going to take out each  and every set, and burn each and every piece, one at a time. Then I’ll  put the ashes in a box and scatter them to the four winds above the  lake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re as excessive as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s not being  excessive. That’s extracting proper satisfaction from a task.” Kaname  tapped her teeth. “Actually, I might take the box to the top of the  clock tower and scatter the ashes there. That’s an idea. Which do you  think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You could float the box on the lake and set on fire,” Momomi suggested. “Like a Viking funeral.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname applied her best severe look. “Now you’re just being silly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled and then fell silent suddenly, face falling slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned when she noticed the change. “What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  was just thinking… I’m going to be taken away from here. I won’t be  able to hear you laugh ever again. I won’t ever be able to listen to  you rant incoherently ever again. I won’t be able to talk with you,  smile with you, do your hair, walk with you, eat with you, work with  you- it’s so… unfair. I don’t want-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname placed her free hand on her friend’s shoulder and tried to work out how to spin this one. <em>I’ll  keep in touch- too miserable. There’s nothing to worry about- too  false. Stick your chin up- too cold. Everything will be all right- too  stupid. </em>“Hey, I told you, didn’t I?” she said, with false  brightness. “We don’t lose. It isn’t over until it’s over… so when  you’re feeling stronger we’ll go and see the Etoiles. They’ll be able  to help us. I hate to admit it, but it’s impossible to argue with those  two when they have their minds set on something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled weakly. “Thanks, Kaname… but I’ve never been the kind of person who thinks they can do everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Wrong answer, huh? I wonder, was there even a right answer to be found? </em>Kaname  raised her head. “Well, maybe they can’t do anything,” she said  defiantly. “But there’s still a chance. And I might not be able to do  anything, but I’ll still be giving it my all. And Olesa and Amiki and  Shion too… you shouldn’t accept defeat just with this. We’re not  through yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You say that because you don’t know him, but it  really is helpless. When he’s set his mind on something like that, he  won’t change it. He’s too stupid and stubborn and-” Momomi fell silent,  her face miserable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t know about that, but it’s got  nothing to do with it anyway,” Kaname said, chancing on a harsher tone.  “You’re the one who can chose for yourself. You can give up now and  slink back home in shame… or you can fight it every step of the way.  Perhaps it’s only choosing the manner of your departure but my mind’s  always made up. I won’t accept this, and I’ll let him, the Etoiles, the  Superior, I’ll make everyone know that. I’ll fight until the end for  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname…” Momomi looked down, her fringe over her eyes. “This is why you’re strong. I can’t bring myself to say that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  use weakness as an excuse,” Kaname said. “If you don’t try, you can’t  know! You can’t disguise a lack of will as inability. If I’m your idol,  imitate me. Fight until you literally can’t, then you can call yourself  weak.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “You’re as unforgiving as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  did you expect me to do? Sit here and hold your hand? How would that  help in a harsh world?” Kaname flicked her forehead again. “When I’m in  a fight, there are times when I’ll get hurt, sometimes badly. But I  can’t stop fighting back because of that. I have to press through the  pain and carry on. After a while you realise that your opponent is  smarting as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s not the case with my father…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  is the case with your father. No man who calls himself a man can listen  to what you said to him without being hurt on some level.” Kaname  shrugged. “Even if he’s pretending to be a rugged, hard man that won’t  change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then what do you suggest I should do?” Momomi asked. “Go back and yell at him some more? How would that change anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  made a face. “You know, I was hoping you could handle that bit. My  fighting analogy falls down because I can repeatedly smack my foe in  the face until they fall over, but that won’t work here and I’m not so  big on the whole plan thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Some things don’t change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But I have a point, right? Isn’t this a good time to try our divide and conquer strategy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi glanced at her. “Divide and conquer?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now,  what you do is… go and find Araldo, say, and rescue poor Serané from  him, and talk him round. He’s such a sap that won’t be hard. Luigia’s  probably already on your side and Yukaho should follow, as she knows  this school… then you’ve got him from all three sides. He’s  unreasonable but he’s not fricking nuts, when you all tell him one  thing he’ll have to listen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Or he might take the chance to exert his stupid patriarchy,” Momomi muttered unhappily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, yes,” Kaname admitted. “But if you don’t do anything, we’re screwed anyway, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess so… you’re making me force myself again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ll  thank me in good time.” Kaname frowned and pulled out her handkerchief,  handing it to the other girl. “Now, clean yourself up and get ready to  go. You’re you, so I know you’ll be fine. I believe in you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned. “You left this handkerchief in here when this stuff was washed, didn’t you? How undesirable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  forgive me for not having a perfectly clean, folded and pressed one to  hand! It’s good enough, isn’t it? Besides, you’re the one who takes my  stuff to the wash.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s still your clothes, you should have reminded me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Isn’t  that a bit unreasonable when you insist on taking responsibility for  this anyway- hey, wait. That doesn’t matter at all, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  laughed. “Alright, alright.” She stuck her own damp handkerchief in her  blazer pocket and wiped her face again, sniffing slightly. “I’ll go and  wash my face. I expect a better plan of action from you when I come  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Easy for you to say. What was wrong with the first one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s completely useless, that’s what’s wrong with it.” Momomi walked towards the bathroom, closing the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t hear you coming up with any better ideas.” Kaname frowned to  herself then realised what she was saying, chuckling softly. <em>That  was fast. I don’t have to force you into anything, Momomi, you’ll fight  until the end. I just have to remind you of who you are, right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And what’s your part in this grand design?” Momomi asked from the other room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  shrugged, slightly unsure herself. “I’ll talk to the Etoiles and all  our friends. To be honest, several of those are a lot smarter than I  am. Well, at thinking of how to manipulate people, I’m no good at such  deceptive things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. But it’s true, when I think about it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  if all else fails, I’ll team up with Amiki and Kariya, dress up in our  kendo gear to disguise ourselves, and beat up your father until he  agrees to let you stay.” Kaname frowned. “That could be pretty fun,  actually. I might make that our Plan A after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t you dare!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  joking, I’m joking! Don’t be too uptight.” Kaname folded her arms,  pouting at herself in the mirror. “I do know what appropriate action  is, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’s hard to tell sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s a Plan C at best, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m still screwing with you. God, but you’re easy to lead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Aren’t you the same?” Momomi asked, sticking her head out the bathroom door. She looked a lot better now, actually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know. Well, I’m sure you wouldn’t have it any other way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  walked up, folding Kaname’s handkerchief and sticking it in her other  blazer pocket. “You’re right, I guess. This way is more entertaining.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As ever, I’m so valued.” Kaname scratched her nose. <em>Business as usual…we bounce back quickly, but is this resilience or being in denial? Is there actually any difference?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">That comfortable state of existence when Momomi’s phone beeped. She frowned and slipped it out, reading the message.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned. “What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s from my sis. She wants to meet me by the lake, alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname blinked. “By the lake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Coincidence.  Don’t read too much into that. But it’s what sis does, when one of  these rows comes up. We meet up and talk things over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, basically, it’s a perfect chance to get her alone and execute my cunning plan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Pretty  much, apart from the cunning thing. It isn’t exactly very cunning.”  Momomi returned her phone to her inside blazer pocket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you before, the principle of divide and conquer is one used by many great generals. For a start, there was Napoleon…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Napoleon lost. We just studied that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  he made a good game of it, be fair.” Kaname shrugged. “Sometimes simple  is best, especially on short notice. While I was cheering for you, all  those things you said leave us with very few options.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What’s done is done,” Momomi said firmly. “I don’t have time for regrets right now. We can save that until later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname nodded. “Good luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi turned away and strode confidently out the door. “See you later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname followed her, stopping and leaning against the door. “You know, I’ve always wondered…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi stopped for a moment. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When  someone like you, the compassionate and weak one, gets like this… where  do you get your strength? It’s pretty impressive, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blushed. “It’s nothing like that. I just-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Think of the tears of babies and the dew on a morning flower or something like that?” Kaname teased. <em>She’s feeling better, so I’m feeling good. For as long as we can smile like this, we can’t lose. I hope, anyway.</em></span></p>
“No, not that-”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm… how about my beautiful smile?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi rolled her eyes. “Are you flirting with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What? Teasing, teasing! Like you did with me before, remember? I still owe you about a month’s worth of embarrassment!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled. “Well, I’m sure I draw an unimaginable power from your goofy, embarrassed look. Keep that up and I’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  folded her arms. “I’m not being embarrassed for anyone’s convenience.”  But she still smiled at Momomi’s back as the girl ran off. <em>I wish I hadn’t said good luck, now. There’s no need.<br />
</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Momomi panted slightly as she ran through the forest, feeling exhaustion begin to set in. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">I’m  really unfit after all…promise to self number 53, after this things  will be different series; I will join some kind of sporting club that  will get my fitness up, if only so I don’t embarrass myself in front of  Kaname. Of course, Kaname’s been living the same sedentary lifestyle  for months and she’s far fitter than I am. There’s no justice in this  world at all.</span></em> She slowed to a walk, panting for breath. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Of  course, that’s what you get from the all-round improbably excellent  student. With the circumstances considered, Kaname has to be some kind  of genius… and some kind of idiot, as well, of course. It’s ironic that  someone with such an acute sense of the injustice of this world has  received, and fails to notice, the injustice of her own excellent,  arbitrary capabilities. Or rather, she considers them to be a fair  thing, the nature of the world. I wonder, if Kaname was born rich,  would she consider that a fair advantage as well? Well, I don’t, but  that’s because of my own selfish reasons, the hate of my father. Which  reminds me, I really am a long way in my thoughts from where I’m  supposed to be. As ever, Kaname’s popping into my head when she doesn’t  belong. Is that part of my crush or that nebulous concept love, or am I  just freely imagining that I’m feeling such a thing, based on my own  confusion? No, no, no… if I start on that track again I won’t stop for  ages.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She finally reached the edge of the lake, pausing for a  moment and staring nostalgically over the clear surface. Luigia didn’t  seem to be there yet, so she walked forwards and remembered the past. <em>We  sat here and I talked about who I am. I remember that. In a way,  everything began there. That was when we’d both exposed our worst to  each other.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re looking thoughtful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi gasped and whipped her head round, staring at him. “What the hell are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo shrugged. “We need to talk. In fact, I arranged for us to talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi took a step back, ready to bolt and run like hell. “You tricked me? You did something as low as that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You say low, I say effective. I’m not in the mood to drag you kicking and screaming out of your room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi snorted. “Isn’t that the proper course of action for the high and mighty Victorian patriarch?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo stepped forwards, looking over the surface of the lake. “He’s not here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  said, the Victorian patriarch, the respected head of the Phareli  family, isn’t here. This conversation isn’t happening in that respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked. “What the hell? Have you finally lost it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  told you, Lord Phareli isn’t here. But a man called Rodrigo Phareli who  has a daughter is talking to you.” Rodrigo snorted. “If after thirteen  miserable years you can’t make that simple distinction, then there  really is no hope for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not my fault that you’re  fricking insane!” Momomi winced when her own words registered, bracing  herself for the inevitable blow. But it didn’t come.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you say  so,” Rodrigo said. His hands were in his pockets, and he looked out  over the lake with a sense of tranquillity radiating from every pore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked, finally using her head. <em>He  tricked me here using sister’s phone… that’s something Olesa or I would  do. And now he’s here, he’s being so damn diffuse. It’s not like him at  all. If he wanted something from me, he’d come and take it. That’s what  he does. So… why? </em>“I don’t understand,” she admitted, finally.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“My  father served as an officer in the Italian army in the Second World  War,” Rodrigo grunted. “He was mostly willing, he says, he doesn’t make  any bones about that. But as an officer there were times where him as a  man had to be second to him as an officer. Especially when lives were  on the line. You see?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you’re using your duty as the  patriarch of the Phareli as an excuse for your domineering, abusive,  ignorant behaviour,” Momomi said, testing the limits of her newfound  freedom to say what she liked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You aren’t someone who will ever  understand. You have no apprehension of the concept that sometimes one  must say what is appropriate, not what one feels from the heart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, forget what, what the hell does your black heart have to say to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  cam here to confirm the things you said,” Rodrigo replied. “How much of  it was from the heat of your anger, and how much of it is your truth.  Further, I need to know how strong your truth is, because the truth of  any person is a frame of reference, not a reliable guide to their  actions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi just blinked some more, before she finally found  her voice again. She scowled severely. “So, stop messing around. Come  out and say it. It won’t bite?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo kept his voice flat and even, without looking round. “Are you gay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you an atheist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I like to think of myself as an extremely doubtful agnostic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do you hate me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  chuckled. “I’m glad I’m doing something right. If someone like you had  any love for me my father would throttle me to death from beyond the  grave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Stop playing around, like I said. Where is this going?”  Momomi tried to keep the anger in her voice. “You said it yourself, you  consider this a completed matter!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Life isn’t that simple. Allow  me a few more questions.” Rodrigo closed his eyes. “You say that you  are attracted to other girls and only other girls, correct?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes! I’ll say that over and over until it penetrates your thick skull!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  would you do, if the whole world was against you on that? All your  family, all your friends, your Church, your rivals, your teachers,  everyone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi rolled her eyes. “This is the twenty-first  century, father. I’m afraid the consensus in some countries is in my  favour, and at the very least I have supportive friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  wasn’t the question.” Rodrigo knelt down, picking up a rock. “I asked  you what you’d do, if you lived in such a world.” He skimmed the pebble  across the surface of the lake. It bounced six times before sinking;  she wondered idly where he’d learned that trick.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  considered making a bold declaration of defiance, then realised he’d  laugh at her. With some justification. “I’d live as best I could, when  I could, hiding my feelings if that’s what I have to do to survive. But  I’d still be true to them when I could, and I wouldn’t marry, and I’d  act in secret if I had to. I wouldn’t try to force myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  still thinking in simple terms. You have to understand that in this  world, your mindset, too, will be shaped by those things. In an  environment where it isn’t even acknowledged, except as a matter for  prosecution, I doubt your convictions would be so easy to hold onto.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi snorted. “What’s up now? Since when did you talk about this so calmly, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  you simplify this too much, you’re only insulting those who have gone  before you,” Rodrigo said warningly, ignoring her questions. “In such a  world, there’s plenty of room to get confused, to misunderstand or  simply deny your nature. Nothing’s so convenient as you’d like to  believe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now you’re just making things way too ambiguous,”  Momomi snapped. “If I’m gay, I’m gay. Even if I’m in denial, nothing  changes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Wrong.” Rodrigo had snapped that, but now he lowered  his voice. “What changes is your behaviour. You’d grow up with an  infinite, horrible feeling of self-doubt, and self-loathing, suspecting  that you are weird, denying it, and always, always making excuses for  yourself. I just haven’t met the right girl yet. I’m just less  sexualised than other people are. I’m a little slower than everyone  else is, but I’ll catch up in the end. Those are the thoughts you’d  keep locked inside your head. Because the worst thing is, there’s no  one to talk to at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi just stared, opening and closing her mouth and trying to find words. <em>It’s not like I don’t understand what he’s saying. But I’ve no idea why he’s saying it. What’s he getting at? </em>“If this is an obscure way to criticise homosexuality then-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s the feelings you would have if you lived in such a world. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why are you telling me this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  want you to understand what your own words mean,” Rodrigo said. “I want  you to understand the meaning of being so perverted, unnatural and  weird. It’s a path that can be easy, but it can also be so very hard.  But you say it so easily, loudly, clearly, and irrevocably. That’s what  I’m questioning. You condemn yourself to that so easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know who I am, father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  also something you say far too freely. You’re young, stupidly young,  you’re barely coming to terms with your growing self as it is. It’s not  the time to pretend that you know everything about yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  know about this, it’s not something I can mistake.” Momomi frowned.  “Besides, you told me yourself, how terrible it is to be in denial. I’d  rather be wrong but decisive than that badly screwed up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  picked up another pebble and threw it out into the water. “Don’t you  think you should wait, though? How can you know that there isn’t  someone out there, a special boy, who can finally bring it out in you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m sorry, but that’s beyond the ability of any boy on earth, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  if you thought like that, you might spend a lot of time looking for  that special boy. And it would take a long time, and you probably  wouldn’t get any results anyway. But perhaps one day, you’d find a good  boy, a true, kind, good boy with a wonderful personality, the best  friend you’ve ever had. What would you make of that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A best friend. What’s to make of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  that world I invented for you, you might make a husband of him. That  would be convenient for you, that would protect you.” Rodrigo snorted  again. “Of course, nothing would change in the long run. She’s still  not the special one who can fix you. If you were desperate enough, you  might even keep on looking. Even though that’s a sin, what’s a sin if  it’s to obliterate an even bigger sin? What’s the sin of one action  when it might redeem the sinful core of your very being itself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Father… are you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  a hypothetical situation, again, in my hypothetical world. It’s a  pretty miserable world, Momomi. That world is the consequence of being  so fundamentally broken, in an environment that cannot accept that. I  want you to understand, when you say those things, that’s a reality you  might have to accept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi bit her lip. “It doesn’t sound like that’s what you’re saying at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of  course, you’d have children, Momomi, because that’s what’s expected of  you and you’d be amazed how well people can force themselves if they  have to do so. Not even being so debased would be an excuse to abandon  such a basic duty of humanity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked again. “When you’re talking like this… I don’t know you at all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  only ever knew Lord Phareli. I didn’t want to know you, and you didn’t  want to know me. And this is probably the only time we’ll ever talk  like this, so take these words to your grave. If you don’t, I’ll make  your grave early.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi collected herself. “Look, if you have anything to say, can you just say it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  glanced at her. “One last question. Knowing all this, are you still  going to say what you said? Knowing the consequences of being so  broken? You’re still young, there’s still time to become something  other than what you are now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not broken, there’s nothing to fix, and I’m not changing.” Momomi glared at him. “There’s nothing more to be said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  laughed shortly and looked away. “You have a terrifying degree of  conviction, just like me. And the second child isn’t suited at all to  the position of Lord of the House… just like me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Luigia will be your successor. That’s fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wasn’t expecting to be the successor, either. What would you do, Momomi? If it came to that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d ask the family if they could accept a gay head who’d do things very differently from anything that’s come before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  laughed again. “You’re always so determined to exert your will on the  world. It’s like you have a grudge against it. You’re too stubborn and  argumentative for words… Araldo’s the opposite, he’s got no real  strength but he’s tactful and cautious. That’s why Luigia is the most  suitable heir. She has a balance of both qualities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not interested in such things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  know. Just like I used to be, may history never repeat itself.” Rodrigo  turned and glanced at her. “But you do have my talent, the ability to  state anything with such force that it must be a simple, universal  truth. Because you’re the one speaking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re saying… when you said all that crap, you <em>knew</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  not saying I’m wrong,” Rodrigo said, turning and walking past her. “I’m  just saying we both have that talent. But this conversation is over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Wait!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">He  gave her a severe glare. “The next time I see you, I’ll shout at you  for half an hour then beat you, unless a very long time has passed  since then. I suggest you make it a very long time before we next meet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you going to do with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo headed back towards the dorms. “I’m going to punish you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi ran towards him. “You can’t! Wait! Listen to me as well, you bastard, I can’t-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">He glanced at her. “I don’t want you in my house until you’ve developed some maturity. Do you understand, Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She froze. “You mean-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t say it. This isn’t a favour to you, but to your mother. If we were in the same house together, we’d only hurt her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She managed to nod. “I- understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Remember. Don’t you dare show your miserable hide to me before you are twenty-one!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi raised a hand. “What about Serané-sama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re as pushy as ever. Don’t make me too impatient, girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just answer!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m thinking about it.” He walked away without another word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi watched him go. <em>So  that’s what a true mirror person is. Casting no light, merely  reflecting the radiance of this world’s expectations, black and rotten  inside…and at the end of the day, you don’t know them at all. I’ll  struggle hard, so I never become that.</em></span></p>
