<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>God, I  wish I hadn’t said that. Or not. Maybe. I’m not sure. That’s the thing,  though, isn’t it? One way or the other, I’ve put myself in a position  where I can’t do anything but ask. After meaning to do so all day, and  failing so miserably, it’s pretty clear I need that. But the downside  to committing yourself outright is I’ll have to ask her, loudly and in  the light of day. No, that’s not exactly true…I could say anything, if  it sounded suitably important. Maybe raise some of the lesser things,  Amiki and Olesa and all the others slipping into our lives. But I can’t  do that, that’s the point. If I don’t say it now, in this situation,  I’ll never be able to ask at all. There’s too much uncertainty, when  everything she says, everything she does, has two, three, a dozen  different meanings. I can’t live like that, least of all when I’m  coming to like her. I’m not like her, able to entertain a dozen  contradictory notions at once and accept them all freely. I can’t wear  a mask that she can’t crack, I can’t smile so sweetly that she’s  instantly disarmed, I can’t get through to her at all by subtlty or  careful planning. I don’t know whether that’s a good thing or a bad  thing, but that’s who I am. So I’ll use my methods, a frontal attack. I  don’t have any other choice. At least that way, I can know where I  stand. That’s all I ask. God knows I don’t deserve anything more than  that, but even so, I’m human. Even I can like someone, and I like her.  It’s got to the point where there aren’t any lies left.</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname clenched her hands, staring intently out the window. <em>This time, I’ll say it. I know I can say it. So listen, Momomi. That’s all I could ever ask of you.<br />
</em></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Momomi completely  ignored her teacher’s dronings about mathematics. She’d grown well-used  to the concept that lessons were used to plan her next move rather than  anything relating to actual school-work. But this was the first time  she’d been forced to initiate crisis management in school time. No,  crisis management wasn’t exactly the right term. That implied a certain  knowledge of what was to come, but the very uncertainty of this  situation was one of the many things she was wrestling with. It was  bringing her to the verge of panic.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Another scenario is something  concerning our mutual assignment. It would have to be slightly unusual.  A stratagem so controversial that she can only refer to it in the  strictest type of privacy. But if that was the case, she could probably  have referred to it on the spot. On the other hand, she might have had  to finalize the details during this time. It’s a possibility. If that’s  the case, I have nothing to worry about… except whatever unnatural plan  Kaname has come up with. If it’s so bad it makes </em>her <em>bashful it  must be truly dire. No, that in itself suggests that there’s something  else going on, there’s no way Kaname could be embaressed about a plan  of attack, unless it involved making out or kittens or something. If it  worries Kaname, it would probably cut no ice with my father, none at  all. And why the lake? It’s a quiet place, but there are quieter  places. It’s chiefly important for sentimental reasons, which brings me  back to my original hypothesis. Which isn’t good.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed and began to sketch a another flower. <em>When I think like this, I know there’s something wrong. Forget it. Flowers. Flowers are pretty. </em>Cherry blossoms. <em>They’re  important in Japan. They say flowers have a language, but like any  other it gets lost in translation. My mother taught me everything she  learned about the European flower language, and the Hanakotoba as well.  She truly loved flowers… I should say loves, I shouldn’t starting  thinking like an obituary. But the cherry blossom which speaks of  erudition has no relation to the kind, transient sakura. And camelia  which means modest excellence, it’s not the same as a flower camelia  which is love and longing. Lavender’s another good one…to the Japanese,  it’s to be faithful. To Europeans, it is to mistrust. It’s just as well  flower symbolism is dead to most of the world, or we’d need  translators. Some of them, though, the meanings remain in both  languages. It can’t be a coincidence, from Forget-me-not to Magnolia to  that burning red rose. Cultural assimilation, in which two becomes one.  I wonder, could that happen to languages wholesale? Some people might  resent such a thing, but to me it would be beautiful. </em>She finished with her cherry tree and found a new space on the page, drawing another flower. <em>Daffodil.  Now there’s an interesting case. In Hanakotoba, it means respect, a  simple, wholesome thing. It means that in English, as well. Chivalry,  the determination of the strong to protect the weak. Uncertainty, those  wavering doubts that are very human. And…as well as that, unrequited  love.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tapped her pencil against her lips, frowning  again. She didn’t like the way the last flower had come out. She rubbed  it out carefully, then started again. <em>But, I’ll admit, the idea  that flowers can speak is a beautiful one. I suppose that’s why mother  likes it. It’s an unreal thing, something that doesn’t make sense to my  father or anyone else, but, perhaps, if you know what it means, that’s  enough. Flowers could clarify your own thoughts as much as they’re used  to send your thoughts to another. And flowers can represent others,  too, with these very human qualities… well, perhaps you could make a  flower bed, and call it a person. But if I was to pick just one, I  should be Camellia, in the European sense, of course. Or does that  better suit Amane? Unpretentious perfection…well, I find her lack of  pretention pretentious, myself, but I’m damned if I can say that in  flower. If I was to be honest, I’m a thorn-apple. Disguise and  deception, not to mention potent hallucinogens. So it isn’t pretty… but  don’t take it lightly. I don’t consider myself ugly, though. </em>Momomi smiled to herself. <em>I guess I’m taking myself too seriously.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  is a Dahlia, there’s no doubt about that. Elegance and dignity, good  taste, it’s a flower that spans across the languages but has the same  meaning at heart. Or a white rose, perhaps. A flower that speaks of a  saint. But all the same, she’s more complex than that.  Kariya…Edelweiss? Oak leaves? Just pile up all the flowers that say  strength and loyalty, and that’s her through. Shion would be misteltoe,  as the girl who most needs a boyfriend or girlfriend to make sure she  has something to do with her time besides hang around girls younger  than her… and Amiki is grass. Submissive loyalty, to the point of  stupidity, undoubtly. Olesa… lettuce? Ha, that figures. Which just  leaves Kaname. Aggressive, strong, proud, independent, but all the  same, she’s protected me and helped me. She can blush really easily and  she doesn’t smile very often, she’s a natural pessimist. She’s relaxing  to be around but she doesn’t relax much herself. She’s good but that  isn’t good enough, she has to be the best. She’s the only person I  could call I friend, but she always says that she’s my enemy. She  pretends to be decisive and determined but she has very deep human  doubts, she forces herself so much precisely because she’s insecure  with herself. That’s what I think, anyway. Kaname isn’t anything so  simple as a mere loner or bully, which is the way she’s normally seen.  Her personality’s deeper than that, and it has a certain ephemeral  quality that I can never quite pin down. If I was to chaarcterise her,  even by stereotype, I wouldn’t know where to begin. But I might begin  with a Daffodil. That leaves me where I started.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked out of the window again, toying idly with her pencil. <em>Perhaps  she wants to say that she doesn’t want to help me against my father any  more. But why would she say that? She still seems enthusiastic…insofar  as Kaname ever is enthusiastic. Perhaps she disagrees with my methods.  But it’s not like she’s been above suggesting such things herself, like  when I had to apologise to my father. Which was embaressing, to say the  least. She does resent the others a bit, I think, especially Olesa and  Amiki, but on the other hand she seems to get on with them, in her way,  better than I do. That doesn’t mean, in her words, that she has to like  it, though. Besides, for something like that, she wouldn’t be so  tactful or fussy, now would she? She’d just tell me, and I’d try to  keep her on board. That would be easy, but important, because I’m not  sure what I’d do without her. That’s an odd thing… it’s not like she’s  too important. I guess I need someone that’s reliably on my side, which  definitely can’t be said for the others.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>When I look at it, that’s not very likely, though. </em>Momomi flicked her pencil nervously from finger to finger. <em>Shouldn’t  I be preparing my response to the most likely scenarios? The most  likely scenario of all? But that’s the thing, I’m not certain. I can’t  have any certainity in matters of the heart, because I don’t have any  experience or guidance. Neither my mother nor my father had anything  much to say on the subject. My mother would say something nebulous  about following the heart. My father wouldn’t have anything to say,  except perhaps that I should shut up and let him deal with everything.  If pressed, he’d talk about exerting yourself over others and using  force of personality, which is uncomfortably close to how I view these  things in hypothesis. Both of us are too bitter and disgusted to side  with mother, because of mother. But she would believe that, all the  same. She’s weak, but there was… is… something about her that could  never be destroyed. It had everything to do with romance and flowers  and sentimentality. A sentimentality which should have been impossible  for her and her life. A sentimentality that was entirely weak and  pathetic, trampled by those with strength… but she clung to it, and she  kept to it, with such a winsome smile. I can’t understand that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  that’s a tangent! It’s like my mind’s deliberately dodging the  issue…actually, that might exactly be it, but I don’t want it to be so. </em>Momomi sighed again, brushing her hair out of her eyes. She  remembered the way she’d held her hair when she was playing that game,  a simple but inviting gesture, a way of removing obstacles and framing  her face. She didn’t know what she was doing, but it had felt like the  right thing to do. Something in those red eyes had told me that it had  been the right thing to do. <em>So perhaps I do know a little about  this. Perhaps it’s just something you know. Or perhaps I’m just a  delusional fool. If I’m the one who’s wondering what she felt when I  did that, if I thought I saw a rise, doesn’t that make me the one who  wants to see things that aren’t there? Isn’t it possible that I’ve  completely misread the situation? How can I know that it’s normal to  draw that conclusion from this position? It might be I’m fooling  myself, because I have the same stupid, over-romantic mind that my  mother has… seeing things where there are none. Relating everything to  love, like a clueless child, which is what I am.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Or… even  worse…can I even know whether I’m the one who’s got a crush on my best  friend here? I might just be reading the subtext that I want to be able  to see, because I like to be around Kaname. The way I tease her, touch  her, play with her emotions and mother her, I say that’s all a game and  that when she blushes, I see that as reaction. But her blushes might be  the reaction of a platonic friend to someone who’s just being a little  too clingy, a little too weird. I say she likes me and she’s dishonest,  but that could as easily be me. What if I like her…it’s not like I  don’t know who I am, as hard as it for me to accept. Even in this  environment, it’s not something that’s natural, it’s not what people  expect between girl and girl. But for all I know, it’s informing all my  actions, and this belief that she’s intending to- say something like  that, that might just be what I want to see. After all, it’s merely me  interpreting evidence. What facts do I have? She was a little  embaressed and evasive and formal and made it a proper meeting. This  was after her annoyance at several of my games, where I played with her  embaressment about even the vaguest implications of romance. But isn’t  that a natural reaction? In fact, the opposite may be the case. She  could be planning to tell me to lay off and step back, because she’s  not interested in that kind of relationship. Now, that…it should be  funny, but I think it’d just be excruciatingly embaressing, for both of  us.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But it’s not true, I really am just teasing her. </em>Momomi sighed, feeling a little ill. <em>I  think, probably, but how can I know what motivates me? Even if I am  just teasing her, that doesn’t necessarily inform how other people see  what I do. Today was such powerful proof of that…Kaname might well be  the same. One way or the other. I really should be more careful, but  it’s just so- fun, when Kaname blushes. She’s so dignified and uptight  and snappish and all-round antisocial for the rest of her life, so  being able to reach her vulnerable side and bring it out is a lot of  fun. I’m practically doing her a favour to do so, too. I’d like it if  one day Kaname could believe in Kaname, if she could show weakness and  accept people and live a more normal life, a life with less fear of  being hurt. Of course, I’m just the same, but I’m not sure if I have  the strength to change. She could do it, though. I believe in that. But  that’s just an idle and unlikely dream. I act for my own amusement, not  alturism. And if she ever was able to do something like that, I’d never  be able to follow her with all my heart. I’d have to fake it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi caught the threads of her own drifting thoughts, and felt like banging her head on the desk. <em>What  the hell am I thinking? This isn’t the time for poetic nonsense like  that…there’s more important things to deal with. Kaname might confess  to me. Or she might tell me to stop coming onto her. Crudely put. Or it  could be something completely different and I just have a really dirty  mind. I don’t know how I’d react to either scenario, and obvious the  third option is a complete wild card. But… I can probably deal with  that, I can think fast enough. The first two are harder because I have  no experience of romance or anything like that. I’m thirteen, already!  But I guess I’ll gain experience if I’m forced to begin early like  this. Of course, the learning process implies the existance of major  mistakes. And I’m definitely not sure whether I want to be learning  with Kaname. None of this deals with my reactions. From a purely  pragmatic perspective, I should just roll with whatever she says. I’m  sure I could fake a romance, but I’m not sure how far I could take it.  And… that’s not what I want to do with Kaname. I told her a lot of  truths. I manipulate her a bit, but I don’t think I could bear to go  that far. </em>She frowned. <em>That’s probably my limit, because not even I’m perfect at what I do.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  that just leaves the far more intractable problem of sincerity. It  should be as easy as turning her down or deny everything with a smile  and a laugh. That should be simple. But… I don’t think it can be so  easy. Even if I’m not interested in romance, I like teasing her and  staying close to her and looking after her, because she can’t look  after herself and we’re alone in a moderately hostile world together. I  could easily distance myself a little, that might even be a good idea,  but I don’t think I want to. I like things the way they are. That’s  fine, right? But, even if that was the case, wouldn’t something be  lost? I always liked things to be unspoken, ambiguous, and playful, not  serious, never earnest, always saying things and taking quite different  actions, on and on. I could be at ease like that. Perhaps I was being  irresponsible, but things were more… fun, that way. It won’t change  anything, though. If she has to say either of those things, it won’t be  something we can turn back from. Things will change. Hopefully, they  won’t change for the worse. I can only cling to my selfish hopes,  irrespective of her feelings. I’ve always used Kaname, I’ve played with  her emotions to gratify my own, I’ve never really cared what she felt  when I teased her. That’s all I know to do. It’s something I say  because it sounds dark and I can feel proud, in a warped way, of that.  Like everything else, though, there may be some truth in it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So  I don’t know what to do. But that’s fine. If I think for long enough,  everything will resolve itself. Rationality begets clarity, sufficent  efforts will allow me to determine the best reactions to all possible  scenarios. That’s why the warning was useful, I suppose. It’s just a  matter of time. </em>That was when the bell rang, concluding the day’s final lesson. <em>Oh… so much for that. </em>Momomi  collected up her things and stuck them into her bag, moving slowly and  uncertainly. She took a breath then stood up, walking towards the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You!” Momomi said, glaring at Amiki. “What the hell are you doing there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Olesa sent me. She wants to talk frankly with you. Can you spare five minutes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How did you get here so fast, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Third Class was having a maths lesson next door.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, right…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Olesa’s  gone on ahead, to the library,” Amiki explained. “She has important  business to take care of before we begin with the Church, whether you  come or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I have a prior engagement,” Momomi said, stepping away. “Forgive me. No, wait, don’t bother…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure you can’t spare even a few minutes?” Amiki asked. “This won’t take long, and you can leave whenever you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  was Olesa’s script, not Amiki’s words. But the fact that her rival had  gone so far intrigued Momomi. “So, what does she have to say now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  she has against you and your family. She’s decided it’s too childish to  hold it back.” Amiki frowned, pushing off the wall. “But if you’re too  careless, I’ll hurt you. Don’t be irresponsible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Well, that was actually Amiki speaking that time. </em>“That  sounds like the most mature idea she’s ever come up with,” Momomi said.  “But it can keep. Like I said, I have places to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure? This is about family, after all. Your family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced back at the girl to find her stony-faced. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  for Olesa to say. But don’t expect her to wait already. She has a  reason to hate you, if you aren’t interested in her reasons, she won’t  tell you. This is a favour to you, not the other way round.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  considered, cocking her head. A few minutes should be fine. Kaname  wouldn’t mind waiting that long. Hell, she’d tell Kaname to come over  here. But she also understood that Kaname’s message was important, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It concerns your father,” Amiki prompted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That decided things. Momomi flipped out her phone and composed a text message. <em>Kaname. Discussion on Olesa’s motives, library. Come asap. We’ll talk later. </em>She sent it, sighing. “Alright, take me there. This had better be good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It will be, of course, believe that,” Amiki said. “I want you to know I’m not happy about this. Not happy at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I could care less,” Momomi countered. “And Olesa, too, it seems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki bit her lip. “Whatever ojou-sama says is fine by me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ojou-sama?” Momomi queried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  no point in hiding it now. You probably have some idea anyway. I’m a  servant. I’ve been a servant since birth. Here to look after  Olesa-sama.” Amiki shrugged. “There are more stupid reasons to be at  this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re happy to be a servant? In this day and age? How ludicrous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An  egotist like you could never understand,” Amiki said. “To protect  Olesa. To help Olesa. To watch Olesa. To be by her side. That’s more  than I could ask of anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “That sounds more like a crush than honest service, Amiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My real name’s Alicia,” Amiki said. “But you can say what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  she pays the term fees for you, a servant, to attend this school as an  equal? That’s also ridiculous. The financial waste it represents… I  suppose the Peres family doesn’t have many money worries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki gritted her teeth but said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stepped out into the rain, which had finally broken and was splashing  down, forming large puddles on the elegant tiled courtyard. “This  blasted weather,” Momomi said to herself, pulling an umbrella from her  bag and opening it. “Why does it have to be so damn wet all of a  sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki pulled out her own umbrella, saving Momomi from  the irritation represented by having to share. “It’s been dark all day,  you idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.” Momomi looked up at the cloudy sky. <em>I hope Kaname remembered her umbrella for once. She always forgets, and has to share mine. </em>She  bit her lip guiltily for the moment, then dismissed the thought. “So,  tell me about this servant thing. Why does Olesa in particular feel the  need to violate the strict rules against them attending this school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think?” Amiki asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Paranoia?” Momomi hazarded. “Laziness? A sense of entitlement?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing like that. You’re very clueless, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You tell me, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you can’t guess, you’re even more stupid than I thought.” Amiki  shrugged. “It’s not a very complicated reason. But perhaps someone like  you would never understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This explains why you’re so  completely under her thumb,” Momomi said, looking at the trees of the  forest. “You’re paid to be so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d do the same thing even if I wasn’t paid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you really do have a crush on her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  just a matter of loyalty and platonic admiration,” Amiki said. “Not  like your relationship with Kaname. That is definitely unhealthy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have any right to comment on that,” Momomi said defensively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, have you found love? Or just lust? Or is it just a crush? You tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s nothing between us! Friends is the most you could call us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right. If you believe that… you really are stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They walked on in a tense silence. Momomi assessed the situation in her head, checking it from every angle. <em>Kaname  will probably be annoyed that I postponed her meeting, but this is an  important chance to get to Olesa. I can’t break through to either of  them because I don’t understand them. Well, I already know a lot more  about Amiki. With Olesa’s confessions, things will be better. She just  has to come and back me up, I’m counting on her to protect me from  Amiki if I need to say provocative things. Besides, with no love lost  to these two, she’ll be glad of the chance. </em>Momomi sighed. <em>Why  does this sound like I’m just making excuses in my head? But it’s true,  this is something important that she’ll understand. She can talk to me  at any time. Besides, her and me together, grilling Olesa and Amiki,  that’s something we enjoy. That’s the old times that I favour so much  and I don’t want to lose. One more time before I talk to her, or even  one more time to reassure her that things haven’t changed. It’s still  us together, against these two, against the world. That hasn’t ever  been any different. On the other hand…I guess I’m running away, a  little. But it’s only a matter of a few minutes to clear my head and  think about something else. It’s fine. To do everything, that’s always  my way. And where Olesa is a changeable enemy, Kaname will always be  there. I can count on Kaname.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki pushed open the doors to  the library, walking confidently through the shelves and finding her  way to a tight corner, dominated by a single large table. Olesa was  sitting there, scrolling down and reading something on her laptop.  Momomi leaned forwards to try and catch what she was working on, but  she couldn’t see anything more specific than a string of letters and  numbers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re up 3.2 over the past month, Amiki,” Olesa said.  “It looks like trend following really can produce results, even in the  hands of amatures. But I’m sure I can do better than this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s excellent news, Olesa-sama,” Amiki said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please, not so formal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing?” Momomi demanded, annoyed at being summoned here and then ignored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  following the stock market,” Olesa explained. “Not with real money,  actually. But for the past six months I’ve been attempting to learn  business techniques. By maintaining a fictional portfolio I can test  various theories without risk and prepare myself for the time when I go  it for real. This is what I’ve been doing without attending clubs. How  about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi folded her arms. “Cut to the chase, I have things to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  well,” Olesa said, closing her laptop and turning around. “I’ll  explain. But that hobby of mine is a useful illustration of unfortunate  fact. The Peres family has been much reduced.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  sighed. “I have decided that it would be cowardly to continue as I am.  By hiding things from someone and holding onto your thoughts and  resentments without stating them clearly… that is immature behaviour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just waited it silently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  I said,” Olesa said. “My family has been much reduced. This is because  of the Phareli, as you may have guessed. More specifically, that’s  because of your father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My father?” Momomi asked. “Don’t blame me for anything that idiot does.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  your father married your mother… he tore up an arranged marriage in the  process. That was to my mother, of course.” Olesa narrowed her eyes.  “People make much of such acts of rebellion, but all actions have  concequences. This was a significant blow to my mother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, so you didn’t get the title and money of my family,” Momomi said. “Hold on, I’ll get up my handkerchief.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  itself, this wouldn’t have mattered so much,” Olesa said. “She managed  a lesser catch, a lesser man, but one with enough money to keep the  family afloat. The problem was that my mother was commiting adultery  with your father inside of two years. Were we even concieved by that  point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, by the way.  We’re definitely not half-sisters. My father made sure of that.” Olesa  laughed bitterly. “He certainly didn’t take her assurances on faith.  But the DNA tests were conclusive. Even so, our home was broken. He  divorced her with terms that favoured him. It’s a miracle my mother  managed to keep custody of her own daughter. But we were not rich. We  were disgraced.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I don’t like it. It’s not like Olesa to say so much, so fast, and so sincerely. What game is she playing? </em>“Well,  forgive my tactlessness, but more fool your mother,” Momomi said. “I’m  still not exceptionally moved. My father is a bastard who has nothing  to do with me, but she ruined her own life. That’s her fault through.  You have my sympathy, but it has nothing to do with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have  always hated you, Kiyashiki-san… no, Phareli-san.” Olesa stuck her  hands in her pockets and carried on as if she hadn’t been interrupted.  “Ever since I was old enough to understand who you were, you and your  sister both. We never met since we were six, because by that point my  mother had stopped being invited to the social functions you attended.  But at that point, my mother told me who you were, and I hated you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a very pathetic manner of thinking,” Momomi said tensely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want you to picture someone,” Olesa said. “She’s your age, your height,  shares many of your characteristics. But she is a more perfect being.  She has all the priviliges and wealth and comfort you lack, but she is  complacent, diffuse, arrogant, never appreciating what she has or the  responsibilities that comes with it. You, attaining everything you have  attained by struggle, effort and great pains, taking responsibility at  a younger age than should ever be considered, still stand below her.  Isn’t that a familiar story, Phareli-san? Someone very close to your  heart lives that story every day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t make it logical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take  it or leave it,” Olesa said. “Even if the story’s told several times by  different people, it’s the same story in the end. To see them as a  rival, an enemy, someone to hate and attack, someone to exeed to  validate your own existance… what do you make of that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  scowled, taking the bait. “It’s stupid and irrational! To struggle  pointlessly like that, to hate like that, to obsess like that, it’s  pathetic. Your existance should not be validated through the  destruction of others. And it’s equally plain you don’t understand her  at all. No one is so simple. Perhaps clinging to those stereotypes is  comforting, but it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Olesa murmurred. “I’m glad you’ve qualified your position so eloquently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you done?” Momomi demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  quite,” Olesa said, standing and facing her. “There’s one more element,  which is the worst of all. My rival, my enemy, has always been the  child that my mother wanted. Not because you’re more beautiful than me.  Not because you’re smarter than me. Not because you’re more graceful  than me. But because you were your father’s daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will rephrase myself. My mother loved your father.”</span></p>

The  rain hammered down harder now, a tempest that shook the trees and  thundered against the surface of the lake. Water was everywhere. It  washed through Kaname’s hair, dragging her thick blue locks over her  eyes. It soaked through the vulnerable silk of her blazer and shirt,  the sodden fabric clinging to skin. But she didn’t give a damn. She  stared up at the dark sky, mouth slightly open, eyes blinking to  protect them from the stream of rain crashing down. In her left hand,  she still clutched her phone. “We’ll talk later…” she murmured out  loud. Suddenly, she felt like laughing out loud. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, it’s fine,  isn’t it? You wanted to know where you stand…this is where you stand.  You stand alone. You’ll have her full attention just as soon as she’s  finished with everything else she’s been doing, with everyone else  she’s been talking to, Olesa and Amiki because… perhaps… enemies are  more important than friends. To someone like her, perhaps, friends can  be taken for granted. Enemies can do what they like, but a friend can  be relied on to wait, even if it means standing in the rain. </span></em>And, of course, that was exactly what she was doing. The bitter irony of the situation cut her deep. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  Kaname Kenjou answers to Momomi Kiyashiki, she goes to the library. If  she is nothing to her, she goes back to her room. So where does that  leave the Kaname Kenjou that stands here like an idiot, waiting in the  rain? </span></em>Kaname felt her neck start to protest, so she looked down at  the lake instead. It was criss-crossed with hundreds of tiny ripples,  each the fall of a single drop of water. It was an eerily beautiful  sight. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The one who just wants to be her friend. And if not, she’ll  do this. Pretentiously theatric, but she just doesn’t give a shit any  more. What’s the use? </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I should go. All I have to do is walk away, and I’ll break my dependance on her. I don’t need her. </em>A  shiver wracked Kaname’s body, forcing her to hug herself against the  cold. But she made no move to shelter herself underneath one of the  trees. <em>But I just know that really I do. So I’m here in the rain.</em></span></p>
