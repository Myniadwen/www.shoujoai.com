<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, no  time for a side story, but a little more Olesa nonetheless. I'm always  open to suggestions. But I think it will take a little while longer for  Kaname and Momomi to sort themselves out; Kaname's still in the &quot;now  that's just wierd&quot; state of mind and Momomi's not substantially  advanced either...</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Couldn’t you have assigned us a more useful club?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you’re finally admitting your reservations, eh?” Momomi frowned at her  rival, disappointed with Olesa’s eternally impassive visage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wrong.  If you picked out the literature club purely to expose one of my  perceived weaknesses, you will be sorely disappointed. I am fully  capable of both analysing and writing fiction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Analysing’s the  word, but when you talk like that, there’s no way you’ll be any good at  this,” Momomi said, shaking her head. “You’re way too precise and  scientific about everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Precise, incisive phrasing is an advantage even in writing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, in theory, yes, but not to the degree where you sound like a thesis in physics.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  shouldn’t worry about me. Be more concerned about your own abilities.  Your grades clearly show that you are only average to comprehension.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  because I don’t try,” Momomi replied. “I get those results with little  to no effort, so you can rest assured that when I go all out I’ll be  able to beat even your best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a famous excuse for  mediocrity, but I’ve always seen it as an absolute, independent of the  reasoning.” Olesa folded her arms. “If you can do something but do not,  the end result is the same as if you can’t do it. In this instance, it  is your effort and discipline that has prevented you from doing well,  but you have still failed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The difference is that it’s hard to  fix a true lack of ability, but effort’s more easily forced. And I  intend to force it now, because I have a very good reason to excel.  Don’t worry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder whether your mind is as disciplined as you think it is,” Olesa noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll see for sure, but I could work as hard as you do if I liked. That’s just too boring for words, though, so I won’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Once again, the fact that you have chosen not to is proof that you cannot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, whatever. It’s a moot point. We’re nominally on the same side here, remember.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand. But I still wish that we were joining a more useful club.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed audibly. <em>Be that way. I guess I’ll shoot for civility. </em>“What kind of books do you like, Olesa-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  gave her a suspicious look, as if trying to see the trick. “Wouldn’t  you say that someone like may has no time for anything but technical  manuals and books on the stock market?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, actually, you don’t strike me as someone who’s entirely like that,” Momomi said. “Well, is that all you read?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”  Olesa frowned slightly, then gave up. “But I come fairly close. I  occasionally read science fiction books for pleasure, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really? I guess that’s consistent with your character.” Momomi closed  her eyes for a moment, picturing Olesa with a 700-page long futuristic  epic of some kind. “Yeah, that’s very much you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will take that as a compliment,” Olesa said guardedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I read romantic fiction, myself. I’ve never quite been sure why. Kaname always mocks me for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  moderately surprising,” Olesa said. “But books like that are just wish  fulfilment, aren’t they? Many such scenarios are romanticised at best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s more a matter of bad writers, which you get in every genre,”  Momomi said. “Sci-fi, too, I suspect. Isn’t the worse kind just  technological gratification and big explosions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The point is  well made. But I don’t read those books, and I hope you in turn don’t  read the worse subsets of the romantic genre.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For the most  part, no, but I do dip into it from time to time. Precisely because  it’s a dream-like thing.” Momomi sighed. “Neither of us have to be told  anything about how harsh reality is, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t welcome any attempts to create fellow-feeling between us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  just laughed at that. “I was thinking aloud, that’s all. I really could  care less whether you enjoy my company or not. But we might as well at  least get on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t have any desire to get on with you. I should say that now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “You really have an axe to grind, don’t you? It gets a bit stupid at times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohtori-san  feels the same way about Kenjou-san. Even knowing that, I do not  change. But in a strange way I should thank you. You are a source of  much of my determination.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s all wonderful, but doesn’t it get boring? To be that driven, don’t you just want to relax from time to time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I cannot afford to relent. I am not like you, who can be as complacent as you like without consequence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname has an even harder background than yours,” Momomi reminded her. “By a long way. But she doesn’t go on like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou-san  needs only look after herself, because she lacks any other lingering  ties,” Olesa said. “Someone of her intelligence will always be able to  scrape by, so she can relax.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you? Your mother, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  mother to the standard she is accustomed to,” Olesa said simply.  “Myself and Amiki to acceptable standards. More than that, too, I have  ambition.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shook her head. “It must be annoying, having to work yourself so hard. But, you and Amiki… what are you two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alicia  is my handmaid, my bodyguard and my best- only- friend.” Olesa stated  this factually, as if describing a chemical formula.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you two are always around each other,” Momomi said. “All the time, when I think about it. Do you miss her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you miss Kenjou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not,” Momomi said. “It would be too stupid to miss her after  having seen her in the Church earlier. So you’re the same, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I miss Alicia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked at this admission, staring at her taciturn rival with renewed interest. “How long have you two been together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since we were five, to the best of my recollection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a long time,” Momomi said. <em>Well, of course. Today in stating the obvious…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  I said before, Alicia was born with the intention of serving me in  mind,” Olesa said. “Like her mother and my own. Such resources as we  have are spent maintaining those ties, even if we have nothing else  left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think Amiki would stay by you even if she wasn’t paid for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps, but I could not forgive myself if she did that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is a matter of dignity, and a matter of duty,” Olesa said ambiguously. “Not things I would expect a Phareli to understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  take yourself way too seriously,” Momomi said, without rancour. “You  should learn to relax a little and accept things like that without  considering yourself a failure for them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From the child of the man who made us like this, who wants for nothing, that’s not very convincing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, tell me something. What do you think of me as a person? I find it  annoying to be judged because I’m my father’s daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are lazy, selfish, apathetic and annoying. Briefly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed at that description. “Well, I suppose those are all true. But  just because you hate me, you shouldn’t forget that I have my own  battles to fight. Against my father, and how he will seek to control  me, that makes my future more uncertain than you seem to think. And I’m  always aware of the privilege I have, associated with him, and not  comfortably, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you seeking understanding from me?  We are rivals, and I almost ruined your friendship with Kenjou-san.  Validation from someone such as me means nothing at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mostly,  it’s just good practise. There’s more to gain from being liked than  there is from being disliked, even if I lack the will to follow my own  advice. But…” Momomi smiled. “Wouldn’t validation from you mean more  precisely because you’re my enemy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa glanced at her but made no reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi was almost disappointed when they reached the literature clubroom. <em>It’s  not like I enjoy talking to her, or anything, but getting under her  skin is kinda fun. And really, for all her cold façade, she does like  to talk about herself, if someone’s willing to listen. She’s definitely  not invincible. </em>She knocked on the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come in,” a familiar voice instructed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  opened the door, stepping into a mostly empty room. Tables had been  lined up in a large U-shape, presumably to facilitate formal  discussion. There would probably be twenty people or more in here, but  now there were only three third-years.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Glad you could make it,” Shion said, waving.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing here?” Momomi demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m a club member, of course. Someone had to greet you and bring you up to speed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could have said you were a member! I might have chosen a different club, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought you’d know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I knew, and made the same assumption,” Olesa added.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gave her an impatient glance. “Okay, so what next?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come  and sit down, both of you,” Shion ordered. She turned to her peers.  “The noisy one is Momomi Kiyashiki-san, and the quiet one is Olesa  Perez-san. I’ve told you about them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A pleasure, Momomi-chan, Olesa-chan,” the first said. “I’m Tsukimi Eida.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etsu Hirai,” the second said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hirai-san  is another member of the club, along with me,” Shion explained. “But  she’s also our chief proof-reader. Eida-san, on the other hand-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is directing the third year-and-below Spica play this year,” Tsukimi said enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh? What’s that got to do with the literature club?” Momomi sighed at the look in Shion’s eyes. <em>I have a sinking suspicion that she’s started something overcomplicated again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  now, we’ll come to that later,” Shion said, with the confidence of a  magician conducting an intricate trick. “First things first, the  Literature Club. Hirai-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” the girl said quietly. She pushed a book and some photocopies across the desk. “We’re currently studying <em>I am a Cat </em>by  Natsume Soseki, so if you were to read that… and I’ve copied my notes  on what we’ve done so far for you to reference… and there’s a reading  list of what we covered earlier in the year, if you have any spare  time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,” Momomi mused. “Well, I could probably read them all in time, but only if I did nothing else. I’ll look them up instead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Etsu frowned. “Are you sure this is…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about it, Hirai-san,” Shion said. “There’s no harm done, and we  may even get a new member. You can borrow the book from the library,  they’ll probably have a few spare.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood,” Olesa remarked, shifting through the notes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And remember, Hirai-san, these two are good and long-term members of our club, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” the girl said, still looking uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. <em>Shion  really is always distant…I wish I could see why. It’s not like she  lacks confidence, quite the reverse, she has too much of it, but she  still keeps people a little apart. Such a strange girl. </em>“So this is everything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, everything on short notice. We do creative writing as well, poetry and stories and so on, so bear that in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? Well, I suppose I could knock off a poem or two, and Olesa can write about quadratic equations or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve got something better, though,” Shion said, grinning. “Eida-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion-chan tells me you two are good at reading English,” Tsukimi said. “Is that right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like a native,” Momomi said cockily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m the same. It’s a necessary skill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I suppose Europeans would be like that,” Tsukimi noted. “But the thing  is, we all know the major school play, right? The Etoiles and the upper  years basically dominate it, and people our age hardly get a look in,  but that’s bad for our young actors. So here at Spica’s theatre club we  figured we’d put on our own performance as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t let  Eida-san fool you.” Shion closed her eyes for a moment, grinning. “She  just wants an excuse to stage a big play for the sake of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course. I suppose you’ve heard the major play this year, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Romeo and Juliet,” Momomi said. “Right? With the Etoiles in the title roles, undoubtedly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.  Pretty generic on both counts. So we thought we’d try something a  little more obscure from that Shakespeare guy. Etsu suggested Twelfth  Night. Have you heard of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My mother liked it,” Momomi said. “I can’t say I remember much about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s our play, anyway, it sounds fun,” Tsukimi said. “But we haven’t  got a Japanese copy of the text and in any case it would be dull to  just work from that. So we want you two to work on a translated  adaptation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared. “You want us to do that? That’s so much work!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san,”  Shion said, leaning forwards. “Do you remember, a little while ago now,  I promised to back you to the hilt in your little venture?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” Momomi said, suspecting what was coming and not liking it one bit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  in return, I gained the privilege to drag you into one of my projects.  This is it. I want you two to work on an adaptation. Together, mind  you. It has to be ready for December, so we can start practising for a  March performance. Try and cut it down to about an hour to an hour and  a half, we don’t want to have too much to learn. And feel free to add  personal touches, as well.” Shion tapped her lip. “Was there anything  else, Eida-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s about everything. Well, will you do it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  considered and sighed. “It doesn’t look like I have that much choice.  But I have a lot of studying to do as well. This is going to be a very  busy term.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t suffer under any such debt to Shion-senpai,” Olesa noted. “I’m not sure why this should involve me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Simple,” Shion said. “If you don’t help her, Kiyashiki-san will have twice the workload.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re doing this too, Olesa!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Spaniard frowned slightly, then shrugged. “Very well. It looks like I have no choice, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on,” Shion said. “This could even be fun, you two. In any case, it  sounds a lot more accomplished and impressive than writing a few poems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have way too many evil schemes,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you remain uncharitable,” Shion said. “It’s just a pity you have to  miss our meetings proper, what with the Church thing and all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I notice your interest in that faded quickly,” Momomi remarked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was just arranging this for you. You should be grateful.” Shion turned  away before Momomi could reply. “That’s everything, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The others nodded their agreement.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed and stood to follow. <em>I  knew there was a good reason why I kept myself aloof… the alternative  is being dragged into stuff like this. But it’s also nice to feel  wanted. So go figure. Right now, I want a shower. I’ve been looking  forwards to that. And Kaname will be back as well, and I can shove her  in after me, and then we can talk-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san,” Olesa said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you see Alicia, tell her I’m at the paddock.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The paddock?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’ll understand, and it doesn’t concern you, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed at the still blatant hostility. “Fair enough. If I see her.” She fell into reverie again.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Come on! Bring it, you bitch!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted and ran forwards, thrusting out with her shinai-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop  that!” A rather longer bamboo sword descended onto her head in forceful  reproach, shaking her through her heavy helmet. “For the last time,  Kenjou-san! Students are not allowed to use thrusts, and even if they  could, you can only aim them at the throat!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why? If I stab someone in the chest, they’re still dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no why about it,” the sixth year, Maya Hazama, snapped. “That’s the way kendo is. If you don’t like it, leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn stupid rules,” Kaname muttered, retreating and tugging at her helmet. <em>And blasted uncomfortable clothes, too. How can they stand fighting like this?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  Rivera-san, shouting what you just did is not an acceptable form of  kiai,” Maya continued, tapping her shinai against the dojo floor. “I  know you have more discipline than this, so I expect you to show it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s this girl being here,” Amiki said. “She isn’t taking this seriously at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No excuses!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.” Amiki backed off as well, returning her sword to guard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  been asked for miracles before, but this is ridiculous,” Maya said.  “Getting you to a decent level in three days isn’t going to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She doesn’t have to be <em>good </em>good,”  Amiki said. “Just good enough to fool a westerner who knows nothing  about Kendo. It doesn’t matter if her ki-ken-tai-ichi isn’t up to  scratch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I’m doing this at all, I want to do it properly,”  Kaname said, gritting her teeth. “Even if I have to go through with a  bunch of illogical fencing rules, that’s what’s expected of me and  that’s what I’ll give.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s the first sensible thing I’ve heard you say so far,” Maya said. “Remember it. Now, try again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki sighed, raising her shinai. “Give it your best, Kaname, I’m half-asleep here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gritted her teeth and moved forwards, slashing her shinai towards Amiki’s head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl blocked easily, pushing her weapon away. “Kiai, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled again, shouting raggedly as she brought her weapon round for a second attack. <em>Damn  stupid rules… seven target areas, shout on contact, stamp forwards,  correct direction of movement, situational awareness… what the hell is  this? If this was a real sword, situational awareness wouldn’t matter  because she’d be dead! As if I’d have a sword on me to fight a  sword-armed foe in this age anyway. </em>She frowned in frustration,  trying to split her mind between all the necessary conditions for a  successful attack while aiming to pierce Amiki’s guard. Unfortunately,  the other girl was blocking everything thrown at her with an  infuriating casualness. <em>Annoying. </em>Kaname attacked faster and  with less precision, not so much aiming to hit a target point any more  as to land a good blow, any good blow, anywhere on her foe’s body.  Amiki twisted her sword and pushed Kaname’s shinai away from her right  side, then stamped forwards with a sudden shout, sweeping towards her  foe’s head. Kaname ducked back ungracefully, desperately blocking the  attack, then twisted and tried to stab out-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again!” The shinai  bounced off her helmet. “Just accept this and go back to real  training,” Maya snapped. “As it stands, you won’t score even if you do  hit her. The technique is complicated and you’re way too arrogant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  threw her shinai down in disgust. “Well, it’s not my fault you have so  many ridiculous rules. How much of this matters in a fight? Shouting?  Don’t make me laugh, it’s a waste of breath. Stamping and striking  these little targets and all the rest, what does it matter, provided  they’re dead? It’s a ludicrous sport anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I suggest you leave,” Maya said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, I think I will.” Kaname pulled off her helmet and threw that down as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I never knew you gave up so easily, Kaname,” Amiki said. “It’s quite a pathetic sight to behold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what you like, someone like you should know what I mean. It’s not real fighting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki took off her own helmet, looking at her. “You know, you’re right. It’s not real fighting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted and turned away, trying to unlace her chest plate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it does prepare you for real fighting. I’m saying that. You know why?”  Amiki walked forwards. “Because it teaches something you don’t have,  Kaname, discipline. When you fight you don’t care what you do provided  it works, but that attitude will get you killed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m still alive, aren’t I? Wooden swords won’t teach me anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  they’ve taught me a lot of things, but maybe I have more imagination  than you. Sometimes you have to hold back, not least because you don’t  want anyone to die. More frequently than that, it’s good to be in  control of your motions. The shouting, the stamping, the entry movement  and the continual awareness, they’re all the same, discipline and  unified concentration brought to a point. That’s ki-ken-tai-ichi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excessively poetic, but not a bad summary,” Maya sniffed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, it’s all still worthless to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you can control yourself, you’ll be stronger,” Amiki said. “And if  you’re open to teaching, you’ll be stronger. Running away because you  can’t be bothered to learn a new technique isn’t strength, now is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you so enthusiastic, all of a sudden?” Kaname demanded through gritted teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I intend to kick your ass until you learn that lesson,” Amiki said.  “Right now, you’re just being stupid. Is that all you have? What about  your promise to Momomi? Is that broken so easily? You make me sick.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  piss me off,” Kaname growled. She closed her eyes for a moment, then  opened them. “But fine. I’m not beaten that easily. So teach me this  beloved art of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You finally get it, don’t you? That you  can’t just walk in here and be good at it because of who you are. I  wonder whether that’s a novel experience.” Amiki picked up her helmet.  “Well, whatever,” she said, face disappearing behind her visor. “As  long as you know who’s the senior here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be me,  actually,” Maya said. “I’m very unhappy, though, Amiki-chan. At that  rate I might have got to go back to my room instead of wasting my time  with this farce.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’re not up to it, then?” Kaname asked, replacing her own helmet. “That’s fine. We’ll manage without you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Amiki agreed. “There’s no need for you to be here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  hell there isn’t! I’m not letting you two murder each other while it’s  my responsibility to stop you.” Maya sighed and picked up her shinai.  “Right. Now what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Show me the movements again,” Kaname said. “How you score a point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?” Amiki asked. “No more sparring?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said it yourself, I get it already,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, victory certainly tastes sweet,” Amiki replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  get too cocky,” Kaname said, pointing her weapon at her rival. “By the  end of this year, I’ll have beaten you, so look forwards to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fighting words from someone who was going to leave in a petulant huff a minute ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Enough,” Maya said, sounding bored. “Shall we begin the actual exercises?”</span></p>

Momomi  sighed in relief as the warm water washed over her body, running her  hands through her rapidly moistening hair and pulling out a stray  tangle. She grabbed the soap and started to work up a lather, feeling  the tension ease from her shoulders. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This has been another one of  those long days of mine, the kind I’ll be having a lot more of in  future. Blast my father and blast Shion, and the Etoiles have  complicated things as well. What a life. </span></em>She closed her eyes and looked up into the showerhead, feeling water run down her face. It reminded her of tears. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  I’m through with crying. Everything’s fine now and that’s that. Though  I should bear in mind for the future, Kaname’s a sucker for it. It may  not be dignified but at least it’s effective. Who knows what would have  happened if it wasn’t for that non-verbal communication? </span></em>She frowned at the thought. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Because  of that, though, I have to be a little uneasy. Things would probably  have turned out alright in the end, but they didn’t have to. If I  hadn’t cried like that- if we hadn’t met by chance under those  circumstances- things could have been very different. We’re more secure  now, I think, but it might happen again. If it does, I’ve got to make  sure my ego doesn’t get in the way of what I have to do. If I look back  over these recent days, all my ego did was leave me with a lot of  excruciatingly embarrassing memories. And I came off best leaving it  well behind. There might be a life lesson there, but it’s not like I’m  going to follow it, so whatever.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fifteen minutes later she turned off the water and stepped out of the shower, picking up a towel and drying herself quickly. <em>Still  no Kaname. What the hell happened to that girl? Pity she’s not here, I  just love it when I can boss her around. That’s probably not weird or  anything. I could phone her up, but there’s no point. She’s probably  still prodding Amiki with a glorified stick, instead. </em>Momomi checked her watch then changed back into her uniform, hair still slightly wet. Too wet to comb. <em>Well, it’ll be fine. </em>She  dragged it out of her eyes, smiling slightly at a certain memory, and  put on her shoes, stepping out of the door. There was only an hour to  curfew, after all, and once again it would be up to her to drag Kaname  back and teach her the meaning of the world responsibility. Momomi  hummed slightly as she walked. <em>I enjoy doing that. But I’m amazed I can be so sanguine considering what’s coming up… and of course I just jinxed it. </em>She frowned, an uncomfortable knot tightening in her stomach. <em>Now  that’s an awkward sensation I’m getting far too used to. Something like  having a tennis ball wrapped in wire stuck in my gut. Now aren’t I  lucky? Well, it’s fine. I can definitely handle something that simple,  and I even have help, not that I need it. I can handle that bastard  myself. </em>She scratched her nose. <em>And now I’ve got myself all worked up again. Relax, Momomi. Life isn’t that bad, is it?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  were shouts coming from the dojo when Momomi approached, so she stuck  her head round the doorway with a sense of caution. Amiki, Kaname and a  sixth-year she didn’t recognise. <em>So Kariya’s not there this time.  Pity, I’d like to see her doing her sword thing. But I guess she’s busy  conspiring with Serané, or trying to relax and forget the need for  conspiracy in between. A bit like Kaname and I, I suppose… though our  relaxation phase is probably a lot less interesting. </em>She smiled at the sight of the two younger girls training. <em>I’ll  forgive you for being late this time, Kaname. Work hard and become the  best like you want to, I’ll always support you in that. </em>Then she  remembered the message she was supposed to give, knocking on the door  and stepping in. “Amiki! Olesa says she’s at the paddock, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One  of the two armoured figures- it was hard to tell them apart- nodded in  acceptance. “I hope you haven’t been saying weird things to her, or  I’ll kick your ass.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mind your own business,” Momomi snorted. “She was the one being rude to me, that’s all I can say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The paddock?” Kaname cocked her head. “What the hell is she doing there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Horse riding, you idiot,” Amiki said emphatically. “Whatever else do you do there? Well, I know what you do-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t know she rode, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I do, but I don’t.” Momomi shrugged. “If you know what I mean.” <em>I never found it very exciting and it hurts my legs.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s a stupid hobby,” Kaname said. “Just another aristocratic pretence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Far better than you, sitting around in a room doing nothing-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maya  coughed, instantly stilling the bickering girls. Then she smacked them  on the head, one after the other, with two decisive blows from her  shinai. “Get back to work!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi raised her eyebrows. <em>How violent. No wonder Kariya joined this club. </em>She waved cheerily and turned away, leaving them to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Of  course, now I don’t have anything to do, and no Kaname to not do  anything with, if that makes sense. Mutual tedium is a lot more  entertaining than being bored and alone. I wonder whether Kaname was  like that in her first year here…just whiling away the hours sitting  around and doing the work she has to. That must have been dreadfully  dull. Well, truthfully, I found my own life before I came here equally  stultifying, so I suppose I know the feeling. The sure and certain  knowledge that tomorrow will be the same as today which was the same as  yesterday, and that the day that’s being repeated is in itself dreary,  without interesting people or enjoyable activities to take note of. Of  course, I used to feel a lot like that about the school now, but Kaname  does make things more interesting, somehow. I wonder what that talent  is, because it’s a peculiar one. More people should learn it, then I  wouldn’t be so bothered when she’s off being Kaname. And I don’t have  any books, which is my usual way of killing time. I’ve been too  distracted in recent times. It’s probably good for me, I’m sure they  rot my mind anyway. </em>Momomi sighed. <em>I could go the library, but that just feels stupid right now. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was at that point that she woke up and realised that her feet had  picked up their old habit of taking her somewhere while her mind was  completely absent. In this instance, they’d taken her outside, where  the quiet at least was soothing. Once again she was struck by that  recollection of her mother. <em>She’ll be back here soon. I wonder what  she’ll feel when that happens. Joy? Sadness? I’ve no idea. I wonder how  much this place has changed, as well, but I don’t have the time or  inclination to ask her. </em>Momomi frowned slightly under the night air. <em>Well,  whatever. I’m close, so I might as well go and bother Olesa again. I’ll  get her to be civil to me even if it kills me. Somehow it feels like  her hating me for my father is just another way in which he exerts  himself over my life. It’s… bloody annoying, mostly. </em>She turned  and walked through the forest, this time skipping the turning that lead  to the lake. This wasn’t a route that she took often, though Kaname  used it a lot more. She reflected on that as she emerged from the  trees, leaning against one and just watching.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane was riding  ahead, leading the way, while Olesa and her horse followed obediently  behind. Momomi shook her head, amazed that the blue-haired girl was  still here, even at this time. <em>She really does obsess over her  horses. But I never thought Olesa would be someone like that. Well,  really, she’s not. I do wonder whether she’s doing this to fulfil her  own preconceived notions of the gentility she’s lost, rather than  because she actually enjoys it. Or perhaps she likes Amane’s company,  who knows? </em>She glared at Amane with annoyance and a tinge of jealousy, but of course the other girl didn’t notice. <em>Less  so recently, but it’s hard to forget the amount of time Kaname spent  here, staring her down with that melancholy expression of hers, as if  brooding about something or other, and… I don’t know… dissatisfied.  With herself and with the world. That’s always frustrated me. At the  time I thought that I disliked Amane for being Amane, but I don’t think  so. It’s because she makes Kaname look so insecure, when she should be  bold and strong. She’s a frustration to her and so to me as well. But  it’s a little more than that. There’s something about Amane that keeps  bringing Kaname back here, even though it hurts, and I’m not quite sure  what it is. Perhaps it’s just masochism on the part of my friend, I  don’t know. But she really is so very beautiful and very cold, and she  somehow gets to everyone just being who she is. For someone like me who  has to be someone else entirely if I want to get on with people, it’s  unforgivable. Even Kaname, even Olesa, it’s all the same, two people  who should know better still get drawn to her? What is that quality?  Good looks? A cool personality? Whatever it is, it doesn’t work on me,  which just makes the situation even more frustrating…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san,” Olesa said, halting at the closest point to her rival. “I’m surprised. Normally it’d be Kenjou-san here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry  to disappoint you,” Momomi replied, walking forwards. “She’s busy  kicking your sidekick’s ass at kendo.” She leaned on the other side of  the fence, frowning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I doubt that, but you can say what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. <em>A little more forthright than usual. </em>“In my own turn, it’s a surprise to see you on horseback, even if you tell me about it. It’s not a mental image that fits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you ride?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little, but not now,” Momomi said. “It got wearying. What’s the horse called?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is Ganymede. She belongs to Ohtori-san, who is kind enough to lend her  to me.” Olesa’s face was mask-like. “We had to sell all our own horses,  so this is the only way I can ride. I’m indebted to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Sore subject, eh? </em>Momomi  sighed. “Ganymede, eh? That’s an appropriate name for a school like  this. But I’m glad for you. I wish I could take pleasure in activities  like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’re welcome to switch places,” Olesa  retorted, annoyed. “I don’t like people who don’t appreciate what they  have until it’s gone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, would you fancy leaving your mother in my care?” Momomi replied. “Aren’t you the one with a duty to do where you stand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have no right to remind me of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps  not, but all the same, a person who has chosen their own destiny must  bear that burden. That’s something I’m going to have to learn, so I  expect you to teach me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have to learn alone. That’s the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You brought Amiki with you, so you’ve never been alone,” Momomi said. “Remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t know anything about either of us,” Olesa said, turning Ganymede  back towards Amane. “You in turn should remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good luck,” Momomi said. “I’ll be watching.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smirked at her rival’s bemused expression, watching as the two girls carried on their trotting round the paddock. <em>It  must be very frustrating for them. The horses want to ride freely, but  they’re stuck in this tiny space in the middle of a forest. And  somehow, the girls are just the same. It’s a very mediocre picture of  life, really, if this is what it comes to. But we’ll struggle on,  because somewhere beyond the fence there has to be freedom.</em></span></p>
