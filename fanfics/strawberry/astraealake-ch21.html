<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>Kaname sighed, staring out of the window again. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  day, another pointless, boring lesson. More and more, my life is like  that now. It alternates extended tedium with frenzied activity. Let’s  see… about this time yesterday I was wondering what I should do or say  to try and find out what Momomi thought of me, at great length, with  painstaking detail, and with a lot of circular strands of thought.  Before that I was cleaning a Church, which was a result of the day  before, where I’d charged in to protect her from Amiki and got myself  badly hurt in the process. And after that I ended up in a weird food  game with her in our lunch break, waited for her after school, got wet  and cold and miserable, then received her message and Olesa’s, making  me wet and cold and miserable and pissed beyond all belief…and we had a  big argument which we both probably deserved, but an argument which  settled. She cried and I ignored her, because I was that annoyed. And  then I spent a whole evening being annoyed with myself and how annoyed  I was, and upset as well, and wasted a lot of paper and a lot of time  whiling away the hours thinking stupid things and judging that, on the  balance of probability, we’d never be friends again. But that all  resolved itself the next morning, and now we’re trying to fool her  father into believing that this is a wonderful school for Momomi.  However you look at it, that’s way too much activity in far too short a  time. </span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She closed her eyes, sighing. <em>That’s more in a week  than anything I’d have to talk about of note in any given term of my  first year, though. It’s tiring and pretty annoying, but I guess tedium  broken up by bursts of activity is better than tedium interspersed by  boredom and brief periods of monotony. That’s what Momomi’s done, I  suppose, drag me into a troublesome series of situations that require  my full attention. But it’s not like she did that at first. It’s a  recent development. So, what exactly? Why are we suddenly so busy now,  when we had so much luxurious time to lounge around and snipe at each  other before? I suppose it all started when we agreed to stop her  father from taking her away from this school. Everything else followed  with annoying rapidity, the moment we actually decided to do something  rather than just drift around. But then again, working with Shion,  standing up to Olesa together, not as individuals, the Etoiles, heck,  doing things as a pair as opposed to just apart, they’re novel too.  When we started doing that, though, things got very chaotic, very fast,  and interesting too. Is that a part of our cold war with her father? Or  was our cold war with her father caused by that teamwork? It’s  impossible to separate cause from effect in situations like that- both  might easily be true, in part if not as a whole. And somewhere along  the line, we became friends of a kind, which is the weirdest thing of  all. I’m not sure how I sleepwalked into enjoying her company, but it  happened somehow. I just have to get used to it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And I need some rest, too. God, I’m so tired. </em>Kaname  yawned hugely, continuing to look out the window and down to the yard  below. Her maths teacher was resigned to her continual mental absence,  so she could do this freely. <em>Suits me just fine. I get excellent  results on the tests, anyway, so she can hardly fault me under those  conditions. Perhaps not right now, though, this exhaustion is really  getting the better of me. I’ll only ever admit it to myself, but I  didn’t get enough sleep last night. Up too late chasing myself round in  little mental circles like a dog after his tail. Up too early in the  morning to brood under the cold air like a dog fetching the morning  paper for his master. And always with her in mind…I should probably get  more than one friend. As it is, with the novelty of the thing, I spend  too much of my time thinking about her for it to be anything like  dignified. Not just last night, but trying to work out how to beat her  father, helping her against Olesa and Amiki, abetting her slightly  suspect dealings and everything else, it doesn’t feel right to put that  much into anything. Even if she’s sincere, that doesn’t mean I feel  right in my head, and it’s something that’s remained. I’m giving my  all, which is considerable, to help her, but I don’t have anything of  my own to demand payment in kind. I don’t really have dreams or  ambitions right now, and that’s worrying enough in itself. It’s like  getting to Astraea took so much out of me that I don’t have anything  more to give, and it hasn’t been great here anyway. I guess I was naïve  to think that everything would be wonderful if I just got to a specific  school.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname put her head in her hands, for reasons that had nothing to do with tiredness. <em>However  I look at it, I probably would just have stayed in my room and  continued a meaningless existence if she hadn’t transferred here and  pricked me out of my apathetic funk. </em>She slapped herself on the cheeks, to wake herself up or to banish the thought, she wasn’t sure which. <em>But,  then again…is she any different? What would she have done without me?  After a few weeks of struggling with social inertia and Olesa, she  ended up just like me, but precisely because of that we at least  managed to keep each other on our toes. And now she’s somehow found it  in her to fight this big pitched battle of wills with her father. The  same girl who said her life was so bland and dull she snuck outside and  walked through dangerous parts of town just to get some sense of  excitement in her life. She doesn’t really have any life plans or aims,  either, and where I came to this school with a sense of purpose that  quickly faded, she was sent her as a mitigated punishment, and never  had any sense of purpose at all. We were both the same in that respect.  So why is she fighting so hard now? It’s not like I’m arrogant enough  to claim it’s because of me… for someone like her, exerting herself,  finding a friend shouldn’t be too difficult. And even if that was the  case, if she was to realise that was her reason, she’d stop and go back  home just to be able to say she wasn’t bound by her feelings. She’s  like me in that respect… dishonest. She might use prettier words and  play around, but in her heart she still has that dignity which keeps  her a little apart from me, and me from her. Even now, I don’t think  that’s changed. We both have some pride. A relationship where all those  barriers are broken… wouldn’t that just be scary? You’d be so  completely naked and helpless before them, I can’t imagine that at all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As  it stands, though, she’s fighting, fighting for a cause that was in  part thrust upon her, but it’s still a battle she chose for herself.  That’s something I can only envy. So why is she going this far? Because  she loves Astraea? Yeah, right. There’s no love lost there, she thinks  about as much of this place as I do. It’s one of the things we have in  common. This place, with that cutesy sense of place and community, to  the point of role-play, everyone part of this great play that’s the  romance of the Etoiles, the power struggle of the Student Councils, and  the interaction of the newest and the oldest students, cutting across  the boundaries of age… it must be fun to belong to. But it’s just a  fake, set to rules that make no sense. Age is nothing but woe betide  you if you’re from different schools; even Etoile pairs can come from  different years, but not from different schools, in the exact same way.  The many happily worship the few, however well or badly the few do, but  they’re accountable to no one. For as long as they’re popular, they’re  untouchable. Perhaps even then, tradition will guard them. Most of all,  though, it’s a system which has nothing to say to those who don’t buy  into the game, those who fall through the cracks. That’s what we both  know so well. To their credit, I think the Etoiles know as much as all  this, but it’s like a dictatorship, in more ways than one. They’re  exceptionally powerful, they have a personality cult, and everything  hinges on whether two girls selected for quite different qualities can  lead, guide and protect hundreds of students. She doesn’t have any  particular love for a system as daft as that, even if it tells a good  story.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s an aside, though. That’s not it. Perhaps  it’s this hate for her father, which she feels so fiercely…that would  be typical of her and me alike, to grow so strong from resentment and a  sense of necessary freedom. She won’t be controlled, so she’ll control  other people instead. That’s Momomi’s logic. All the same, however  obnoxious her father’s company is, there’s still her sister, and her  mother, too, though supposedly she’s annoying as well. But what’s the  competition from Astraea? Shion? Amiki? Olesa? I want to think that  they’re still tools to her. That’s a bit hypocritical of me, I know,  considering how desperately I wanted to avoid that title. But I want to  be able to say that I’m her only friend, even as I say that I want more  friends. No, I think it’s closer to the mark to say that I want her to  be the same as me. If she had people she could call friends aside from  me and I had none, I’d just be dependent on her again, while she’s free  of me. And that scenario sometimes feels all too likely. But, as it is,  those three aren’t reason enough to stay. Olesa and Amiki are probably  some reason to go. She decided to stay long before they became  important, too. So I’m the one who’s been by her side ever since she  decided to fight, but it’s still hard to say what that means. How much  does she need me? I still don’t know that, even if I get the sense that  she needs me. What does she require of me? Is it enough for me to  silently support her while she plows ahead? Do I merely have to  tolerate her by my side? Or does she want me to fight with her and say  what I say to encourage her? I should ask, but it’s too embarrassing a  question to pose. Well, it’s fine. It’s more a thinking point than a  major crisis of my faith, to be honest.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, her forehead wrinkling slightly. <em>Well,  certainly I still have doubts, and not everything’s settled. That’s to  be expected of real people and real emotions, things aren’t giftwrapped  and tied up in a bow for the happy-ever-after. Even if they were, ours  isn’t that simple a story. And I still think about her a lot more than  I’d like to. But it’s not like I have anything else to think about, so  whatever. </em>The bell rang to mark the end of the lesson. Kaname packed up her books and slid them into her bag, her mind still distant. <em>I  suppose it comes down to a matter of interest. Momomi is interesting,  and leads to interesting events happening around her. Even if I wish  things could be different in small ways, that’s probably better than  being completely indifferent to everything. Last night, too, I’m  beginning to believe that ties like that don’t have to be weakness,  because even if they can cause pain they make you feel alive. But I  can’t forget the pain, either, so that’s probably just something I’ll  think for as long as I get vaguely happy endings…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  blinked and woke from her reverie to find several students standing  over her. Her eyes narrowed; it had been a while since the last time  that they’d dared to approach her, because she was generally considered  weird, violent and scary. <em>Which doesn’t put me in a good mindset for considering their motives now. </em>“Yes?” she asked sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The leader- <em>Yuho Oyo-something… Oyokawa?</em>- leaned forwards without much preamble. “We were just wondering what you were doing with the Etoiles,” she said sweetly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gave her a blank look, then remembered. <em>Late  for History, and said it was because of the Etoiles- with a note from  them, no less. These things are important to some people. </em>“Oh,  that.” She considered her next move and decided that obstructionism  would be pointless. Honesty might even be more entertaining. “Oh, we  were just talking about Momomi’s family, because they’re coming to  visit on Friday. Just stuff about that, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho frowned, looking slightly surprised. “And the Etoiles were speaking to <em>you </em>about this? Surely it only concerns Momomi-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Don’t call her that. You definitely don’t know her well enough for that. </em>“You’d think so, wouldn’t you?” Kaname said neutrally. “It’s mostly a room-mate thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you a couple?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Kaname gave her an incredulous look, wishing she hadn’t wasted one on the initial question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s what all the rumours are saying, and it would make more sense,” Yuho said, shrugging.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  in this school could that question be remotely constructed as normal,”  Kaname said. “We’re friends, no more, and no less. The concept may be  alien to some people here, but that’s the way it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You stick together very closely for <em>just friends</em>,” Yuho said accusingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I could give her the truthful answer to that… nah, that’d be too impolite even for me. </em>“Well, I suppose so. But she’s a good friend, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho  stared at her for a few moments, as if wondering whether to call her  bluff. But in the end she just stepped back. “Someone like you should  stay away from the Etoiles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled at her retreating back. <em>I wish I could, girl. I wish I could. </em>She checked her watch, her smile fading, and sprang from her seat. <em>Of  course, with her being annoying I’m in danger of running late, which is  annoying. Not that I’m going to run, that would be undignified. </em>All  the same, she walked fast through the corridors of the school, to the  canteen where she knew Momomi was waiting. She swept the crowded room  with her eyes then picked her friend out of the line, walking there  without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re late,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, Momo-chan,” Kaname replied, with her best Serané voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  giggled then tried to adopt a straight face. “Momo-chan… my, my, that  doesn’t work at all. You’re not cute enough to call me something like  that, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh. And that stuck up lady is cute now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané-sama  has a kind of grace and formality, so when she uses an intimate term  for someone, it really means something. But with you, it comes across  like you’re patronising me just before you mug me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, thanks. I really appreciate that sentiment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re more like Kariya, really. It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed dramatically. “Worse and worse. You know how to insult me, that’s all I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you late, anyway? Being chewed out by a teacher?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Close,  but no, so you can’t help me and feel needed this time around.” Kaname  yawned pointedly, shrugging her shoulders. “Just some girls. They asked  me about the Etoile meeting this morning, and warned me to stay away  from them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my,” Momomi said, smiling thinly. “I never knew we were so popular.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you know how it is. There are too many groupies who’d pay to be in even our mediocre position.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  nodded. “Which is particularly ironic, really, because our main  qualification for that role is being… what is it… problem students?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if it’s problems they want, we’re the ones to oblige,” Kaname said.  “Oh, and that reminds me… they asked whether we were a couple again.  The girls, that is, not the Etoiles. That’d be weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? That’s spread fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  just ridiculous. However you look at it, that couldn’t be a normal  question anywhere but here, where being weird like that is what’s  expected, not the exception that makes the rule.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,” Momomi agreed. “It’s a statistically improbable environment, I suppose. But… how do I say this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I put her right about that, anyway,” Kaname continued. “Well, this is  why we should be careful before playing your silly games again. Sorry,  carry on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it was nothing,” Momomi said. “But it’s not like  what they say matters much, Kaname. Surely we shouldn’t mind what they  say, whether or not the rumours our true?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You just want an excuse to steal all my egg again,” Kaname tutted, shaking her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Well, it doesn’t bother me too much, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not like I’m bothered as such,” Kaname said. “But still, some things  are too weird even for people to talk about, don’t you think? You were  the same when all those people were watching, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was,” Momomi admitted. “All the same, that doesn’t mean that I’m proud of it, nor does it make it mature.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. There’s nothing immature about wanting to distinguish between friend and lover. That’s important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about friends with benefits?” Momomi suggested. She giggled at Kaname’s expression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t like the things you get from those romance books of yours,”  Kaname said seriously. “And I certainly don’t like the whole cult built  up around the Etoiles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that, I can agree with,” Momomi  said. “Though I don’t think the Etoiles like it either. The way I see  it, if they weren’t in the spotlight so much they could just be a  normal couple.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They seem to get by just fine,” Kaname noted, selecting her habitual lunch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course, but you know how Serané is. Everything has to be proper, with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think that’s just Serané,” Kaname replied. “She’d probably be like that anyway, Etoile or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re probably right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname followed Momomi as she headed to the elm, a step behind her friend. <em>I  suppose we’re through with the canteen for now, under the  circumstances. There are way too many bothersome people there, and I’m  not afraid to say that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll be meeting with Olesa and Amiki, remember,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got it, already. Have you worked out what we’re going to get them to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry about that. I’ll be keeping them very busy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should think so, too.” Kaname sighed. “We still have to do the Church thing, don’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d  almost forgotten about that,” Momomi sighed. “Don’t remind me. I need  to talk to the Etoiles about that. Preferably Serané-sama. But none of  us can afford that time while my family is here. Hopefully we can delay  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For once, they have a useful ulterior motive,” Kaname said.  “Though that’s a little freaky in itself. I’ve said it before and I’ll  say it again, she’s taking this way too seriously. If my mother told me  she was going to start matching me up to a partner, I’d laugh her out  of the room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Serané-sama is like that. Besides, it’s only  an arranged marriage, so she can always refuse her consent at the  worst. I guess that’s what you’d do, though, where she’s using this  indirect method.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like the way she tries to please everyone. That kind of thing will never work in the long run.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  from the advocate of total victory?” Momomi asked. “No, even if it’s  hard I think I can understand. We’re not from happy families but for  someone who is, it must be difficult. I don’t blame her for wanting  everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Kaname agreed. “But means she has to risk the most important thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned at that, and they walked on in silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re late,” Olesa noted coolly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, Ole-chan,” Kaname smirked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa just gave her a baffled look, then turned to Momomi. “So, do you have our tasks?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.  Hang on a second.” Momomi sat down and stuck her back to the tree,  gesturing for the others to join her. “So my family will be here from  Friday to Monday. During that time I must secure my future here and  Serané must break off her engagement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood,” Olesa said. “I confirmed the details with Tomori-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  girl gets everywhere…” Momomi sighed. “Sometimes I wonder whether she  knows more about these things than the actual parties involved. In any  case, you two, unlike me, have some degree of popularity. So to begin  with, I want you to make sure my family’s well-treated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And their motivation? Not even we can just give orders, you know,” Amiki said, folding her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say  it’s for Serané, which is sort of true. I’d try and find someone to  seduce my cousin, but that’s probably impossible around here. So, the  next part of the agenda… Amiki, Kaname, try not to break anyone that  week. Especially not each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bear that in mind,” Kaname said. “But I made a promise which I intend to keep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean you don’t remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unlike her, I’m not psychotic enough to go through violence withdrawal syndromes,” Amiki said. “So that’s not a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  on that note, Olesa, I know you have an axe to grind with my father,  and I sympathise- I hate him too- but only raise that subject when I  give the order.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,” the girl said briefly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give the order? How will mentioning that kind of thing ever help?” Kaname frowned. “Emotional blackmail?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It won’t help it all, rather it would cause problems. But it would be funny, at least, if it’s all over anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha,”  Kaname said. “Well, I’ll give my warning, too. You hate your father a  lot, Momomi, but be civil and polite. That’s important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, already,” Momomi frowned. “I’ll just have to live with him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa looked up briefly and frowned. “<em>Something wicked this way comes</em>,” she said, in perfect English.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Kaname blinked, then looked over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heya,” Shion said, waving. “I thought you’d be hiding here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re late,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,  but I had to deal with some of my little friends in first year again,”  Shion said. “They’re sweet, but I hardly know them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wrong answer,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you have another picnic?” Amiki asked enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  shook her head, sitting down. “Just my own lunch. If I let them do too  much, I become more obligated to them, which makes me feel guilty. So I  try not to abuse them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you already have, talking about them like that,” Momomi noted, looking annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked. <em>Probably  just at being interrupted, though. But Shion’s always a little  surprising. I suppose paying attention really does win you friends and  admirers. I just don’t have her energy about people. Damned if I’ll  admit as much, though. </em>“So you’re here to scrounge food off your second year friends instead, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something  like that,” Shion said, smiling. “Though I’m also here to support you.  There’s a lot of important things underway right now, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re completely right. And I was talking about them before you turned up and interrupted me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgive me, General Kiyashiki.” Shion kept a straight face. “Please carry on with your briefing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ugh. Humour doesn’t suit you,” Momomi said in a low voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such  an offensive girl,” Shion replied amicably, balancing her bento on her  knees and opening it up. “Oh, and congratulations on not being too  pig-headed, you two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now you have to go and find your Isae,” Momomi reminded her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This time next year, perhaps. You’re not finished yet, Kiyashiki-san, far from it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, the most difficult of tasks I’m assigning you two isn’t  exactly one you’ll relish,” Momomi warned. “But I hate it too and so  will Kaname. That’s to say, it’s necessary for me to have friends if  I’m to fulfil the stereotype of the happy student.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should  really vary your diet a little more, you two,” Shion chided through a  mouthful of rice. “It can’t be good for you to eat the same thing day  after day. Perhaps I’ll treat you all to something better at some  point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So we are to pass ourselves off as your friends,” Olesa said. “What will that entail?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  the usual stuff,” Momomi said, shrugging. “I will introduce you to my  parents. Be serious, my father can’t stand flippant people. So he  should love you for just as long as he doesn’t realise that you’re your  mother’s daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That much shouldn’t be difficult.” Olesa  narrowed her eyes. “I can deal with idiots like your father, provided I  can keep my temper in check.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite… and we’ll need to keep up a  façade, too. So it will probably be necessary to meet up in the  mornings and in breaktime and lunchtime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, you mean, you’ll  have to go to a predetermined location and eat your lunches together,”  Shion said. “Fancy anything, Kenjou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not particularly, thanks,” Kaname said, eating her own lunch in swift mouthfuls in between glaring at Olesa and Amiki.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And we’ll need to attend club activities, too,” Momomi mused. “What do you do, Olesa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I attend the computer club regularly. Though I also go horse riding from time to time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Playing computer games in school time, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, actually,” Olesa said flatly. “But I wouldn’t recommend it for you. I doubt you’d be able to keep up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  flushed as if she was going to take the challenge, then shook her head.  “Well, I’m not interested in such a dreary thing… how about the  literature club? We will both join that for these five days. I expect  you to be useful, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that an order?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s an order.” Momomi folded her arms. “I thought you’d be less confident about anything that isn’t hard numbers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  may not be especially gifted, but my talents in this field can match  your own,” Olesa replied. They glared coldly at each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still doing the karate thing, Amiki?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right, but I doubt you’ll be very welcome there,” Amiki warned. “I do  kendo as well, though. Do you think you can do that? We’re pretty  exclusive, and lead by Kariya-sama herself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No problem,” Kaname replied. “It’s just a matter of reflexes and fitness, so I’ll be more than fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t take that sport likely,” Amiki warned. “You’ll get hurt if you do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the same to you, if you take me lightly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed. “You’re all as frisky as ever. Just to warn you, even if you’re  just faking an activity it’s not easy. I suggest you practise with the  few days you have left to prepare.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s best,” Momomi agreed. “Oh, and try and stay in the kendo club until Friday, okay, Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  all hopeless, talking like this,” Shion sighed. “Why can’t you all be  friends anyway?” She opened one of her eyes a little and grinned. “Too  much to ask?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Definitely too much to ask,” Momomi said, speaking for the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s funny, because you’re all so alike… no, perhaps you dislike each other precisely because you’re all similar.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re not alike, either! Definitely not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Totally,” Kaname agreed. “Don’t compare me with these guys.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is one of those rare moments when I actually agree with Kaname,” Amiki  said. “So we can both fight, that’s it. I’m nowhere near as deceptive  and insecure as her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really? Well, I’m no lackey with a dog’s loyalty and no free will, either!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At  least I have some friends and a purpose in life, where you lack both,”  Amiki said. “You just spend a long time doing nothing, and now you’re  dependent on Momomi just to have something to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes,” Shion said, shaking her head. “I understand, already. Shall we just eat our lunch in a vaguely amicable silence?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smartest thing you’ve said all day,” Kaname remarked. She prodded her umeboshi philosophically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, and Kaname’s next move?” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s easy. Close your eyes and open wide.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my. Ahhh…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname fed her a piece of fish, watching with a straight face as Momomi choked in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey! That’s cheating!” Momomi protested, coughing. “Ugh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be too surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m getting you back for that,” the brown-haired girl warned, massaging her throat. “Round two starts here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  looked between them and the other pair, who were methodically and  silently exchanging food. “Hmm,” she said. “Well, here we have exhibit  A.” She pointed at Kaname and Momomi. “That’s to say the newlyweds, who  have the excitement of novelty but are still a little inexperienced.  Whereas exhibit B, Perez-san and Rivera-san, are the longer-term  partners. They’ve got it better organised but there’s a sense of  routine, too, which blunts the spontaneity.” Shion leaned back, sighing  dramatically. “I guess that makes me the lonely, ageing bachelor  figure. Poor me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here you go with your weird observations,” Kaname said. “It’s very annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s pretty hypocritical of you, who says the weirdest things at inappropriate moments,” Amiki said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion shrugged. “I just say what I see. You can’t blame me for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case,” Olesa said, breaking out her chopsticks. “Once we’ve done this, we’re through, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right,” Momomi said. “That was our agreement, and I intend to keep it.  You can delete anything compromising for you on my phone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I’ll want to have yours, too, for that. If I know, you’ll have recorded our original conversation on this subject.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shrugged and nodded. “You’re just the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re both such bad girls,” Shion said, amused. “Conspiracy everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I still owe you one for Kaname,” Momomi said. “Bear that in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your words were your own, so you owe me nothing. It is up to you to take responsibility for them, not lay it on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. You can say that, but I’ll still do what I like, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa smiled thinly. “Then give me your best shot, Kiyashiki-san. I’ll be waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  was about to reply, but she was cut off when Kaname stuck the umeboshi  into her mouth. “It’s annoying,” the blue-haired girl said. “Just eat  your lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright.”</span></p>
