<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Author’s  Note: </strong>This is an  Altiverse Fic (Alternate Universe FanFic). This is a short fic,  created thanks to a really bad case of mental block. I’m also  trying a new style. I call it dual narrator, which is probably why  it’s so short…</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  fic was intended to be something longer, but looks good and could may  stand alone as a short one-shot. (<em>Yes  even I </em><em><strong>(Asakust)</strong></em><em> can be lazy sometimes.</em>)  I’ll smoothen this out later… when inspiration comes again. </span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>---</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>A  year ago… </strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>two  brave warriors clashed swords at the coliseum of Astraea Hill…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Blue Knight, Ootori Amane, a child from one of the most revered of  noble families and a powerful knight in her own right. She wields the  enchanted sword “Star Bright”, a powerful magic artifact that is  passed down in the Ootori bloodline. She wore a higher knight’s  garb, themed in blue and adorned with the symbols of the stars and  their family emblem.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Opposing  her was Swordmagess, Nanto Yaya, Priestess Hikari’s sword, shield  and friend. She was a powerful nearly immortal dark mage, who was  given salvation by the priestess from the darkness ten years ago.  Since then she had been at her side; protecting her, fighting for her  and being her closest friend. She wields “Yami”, the katana from  the darkness, and another sword but she never calls its name. She  wore a black cloak, which covered the black tights and occasional  chunks of red armor pieces.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  had been looking forward to this day ever since she was young girl.  From the day she had learned that the most powerful warrior was the  always young and beautiful, elegant and powerful, skillful and  mystical warrior mage of the darkness that served their very own  Light Priestess… who is Nanto Yaya, the Dark Swordmagess.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>it  was their first battle…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  their first fight, they fought for the right to be at the priestess’  side. It was Hikari’s elders that had decided that Yaya be replaced  by a knight, but there was no doubt that Yaya was a powerful swords  mistress and mage, which lead them to order the two to fight. It was  a duel to see who was more powerful, and the victor will be the one  to be at the Priestess’ side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  was no fool. And unlike Amane, dreaded this day would come. No matter  how much she wanted to stay at Hikari’s side, she knew that the  young priestess’ heart yearned for the blue knight. So despite how  easy she knew she could defeat the one who wielded “Star Bright”,  she had made sure to hold back and to lose… on purpose.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>in  the end of their battle…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  did well she was wounded pretty badly by the Blue Knight. But it was  nothing her darker powers could not heal. No one had noticed that she  had lost on purpose; The Light Priestess that had long stolen her  heart, wanted another. The elders have decided to make Amane Hikari’s  new Knight and that Dark Mage finally be banished away from the  Astraea Hill holy lands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  was ready to leave. She had little to no belongings that need moving.  A few clothes, a trinket or two… nothing she can’t afford living  without. The Priestess’ promise forgotten by her she could only do  one thing… and that was to leave, getting as far away as possible  before the darkness that ate at her once again blackening heart grew.  She had chosen to exit south, where there was always the least  people. Less people meant less delaying her departure and chances  anyone finding her before she can leave.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>But  someone did find her…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dark  Swordmagess, sword and shield of the Light Priestess, Nanto Yaya!”  Amane called her out loudly as she was just after she had stepped out  of the city gates of Astraea Hill, with her sword drawn and stance  more than ready.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Dark Mage stopped walking for a moment; “It’s former sword and  shield… weilder of Star Bright…” she said cold and almost  lifelessly, not even turning her head to look at the tall blue haired  warrior.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  gritted her teeth in anger and frustration; the ageless woman still  didn’t recognize her or was unwilling to recognize her. She wanted  the Dark Swordmagess to call her name. She wanted the strongest  warrior to recognize her and call out her name when she spoke to her…  no glorious battle nor heroic deed could make her feel more  fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  aside from that, she knew that the Dark Mage threw the fight to her.  She believed that there was no way that Yaya could have even be  scratched at all had she been serious with the battle. She wanted to  know why the nearly immortal woman wanted to lose. “I challenge you  to a duel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  let out a tired moan, “You had just won. Isn’t that enough?”  the raven haired Swordmagess asked the knight, her voice sounded very  annoyed. Yaya didn’t really care about winning or loosing,  especially if they had no special consequences. Like this duel that  the blue haired knight is asking, had no special meaning to her. It  was to fill the pride of a knight of a noble family.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  lost on purpose! That wasn’t a proper duel!” Amane argued. She  felt as if her pride had been dropped stepped on and utterly buried  in soil and coal. She was a Knight from the Ootori family bloodline.  She held the brilliant white sword Star Bright and yet this Dark  Swordmagess thinks she needed to loose on purpose to become the  Priestess’ knight. No! She wouldn’t stand for it! She had been  looking forward to fighting this woman with her all for far too long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  turned to look at Amane, her Amber eyes reflected the light of the  fading sun like glowing orbs. “It was for the Priestess.” There  was pain in the voice of the dark haired sorceress.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you mean?!” Amane was confused and angry; to her even the simple  sentences of the dark haired woman were puzzling as her actions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya  closed her eyes, her face looked hurt, saddened and empty. “You  don’t need to hear it from me…” Yaya then turned around again,  and began to walk away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!  No you don’t!!!” Amane charged at Yaya and swung her sword to  slash Yaya in half, gone was the knowing thought that her opponent  was someone she could not possibly defeat, she attacked with the full  intent on killing the black haired sword mistress.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  just as the sword was about to reach Yaya’s head, Star Bright was  parried by Yami, Yaya’s magical black Katana. The sword’s dark  aura, fought against Star Bright’s white aura… and was winning…  effortlessly. Yaya turned, throwing off her black cloak and kicked  the Knight’s stomach sending her flying backwards and winding her  for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  looked up and saw Yaya standing a good thirty feet from her. Her eyes  glowed red, no longer the soft amber that she knew always looked at  the priestess. Catching her breath, she begins to stand up and got  into her battle stance once again. But her body felt weak, and all  she could do was hold her weight while leaning back on the city’s  outer walls.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>This  was their second duel...</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  are you so intent on fighting me? Blue Knight.” Yaya acted coldly,  her voice was like cracking ice under a cold burning flame. Her eyes,  voice nor aura, no longer held a shred of kind, gentle, and soft  spoken mage that stayed beside the Light Priestess Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  was completely baffled… ‘what could make her change so much… so  fast…’ she thought. ‘was it the priestess’ close presence  kept the darkness of her powers from eating at her? if so… why did  she leave. If she wanted to no one could make her leave.’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  are you so intent on leaving?.. Yaya…” Amane asked.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>But  her answer came differently…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yami  and the other sword, were drawn. Amane could feel Yaya pouring so  much dark mana into the swords.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blue knight knew it was her end, the killing intent that the Dark  Swordmagess released at her was incomparable to anything of this  world. She felt immense fear that chilled her to the very core of her  being. All she could do was close her eyes and pray it would end very  quickly for her. And in an instant she heard the swords hitting the  city walls creating an eerie screech that chilled ones bones...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘The  end… huh?’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  opened her eyes… and saw two swords threatening to slice her neck  off. And behind them was Yaya, her glowing red eyes were in tears.  She was looking down, letting her tears moisten the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane’s  eyes grew wider hearing the the Dark Swordmagess, soft crying  question… “Why?... what?” she asked with a nervous voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>WHY!?!”</strong> Yaya’s glowing red eyes looked her straight in the eyes as she  screamed at Amane many times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>Why  does she love you?!” </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘…<em>Love?  …Who?’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>Why  can’t I just kill you?!!”</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘…<em>can’t…  you could do so… effortlessly…?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>TELL  ME!!!”</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  was stunned at the display. Yaya’s voice was full of rage, hurt,  and pure utter hatred. The Dark Mage cried, something she had never  seen or even thought someone that had been bathed in darkness could  be capable of. For once in her life she was also confused on what to  feel. Should she fear for her life? Pity the magess’ pain? Anger  for loosing a battle she started so pitifully? Or just be happy to be  still alive?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  dark haired woman calmed down soon enough. When her eyes lost its  blood red glow and returned to the lifeless amber, she withdrew her  swords and sheathed them. “Do me a favor, Wielder of Star  Bright...” Her voice sounded cold once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  knight could only grunt in pain to respond.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never  show your face to me again. I cannot guarantee your life next time.”  Yaya then picked up her cloak, and walked away as she placed in on  herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  could only watch her leave; she didn’t have the strength or the  will to fight anymore.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>Amane’s  life was spared…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  looked at the setting sun…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>but  her pride was not…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…then  screamed with all her might.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN  IT ALL!!!”</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>She  was later found and attended to…</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  guard had found the beaten blue knight. She had a few broken ribs and  a deep bruise, both from that one attack that hit her. She was  brought back to Spica Temple. Where she was to be healed and asked to  explain what had happened. Amane did so even at the cost of her  pride. She knew now that the best guardian for the priestess was the  Dark Swordmagess… no one could possibly replace her power, skill  and loyalty to the Light Priestess… not even herself, a fact that  had to be beaten into her to sink in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya’s  words rang in her ears over and over that day. The pain, the sadness,  the anger… the hate... It all hit her harder and harder each time  she remembered. She knew that the dark magic has a tendency to drive  the magician insane. But Nanto Yaya, was the most level headed,  tactical and calculating person she knew… how could just…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Leaving  the Priestess…” Amane said loudly to herself. “she was asking…  why does she love me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was then that Amane realized that she was the great cause of the Dark  Mage’s change. ‘Yaya loved the priestess so much, she was willing  to lose… leave and submit to the darkness again… to…’ It was  normal. Without the Priestess’ support her, she was having trouble  restraining the dark impulses in her. Or maybe it should be said  that… Without the Priestess’ she had no reason to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  then slammed her fists on her table. Tears slowly began to form from  her burgundy tinted eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  my fault!” She blamed herself. She treated the Priestess nicely to  learn more of the Dark Mage. So many feelings engulfed her that  night. The strongest among them… sadness… and guilt… for  hurting the one person she had looked up to for so many years. The  person who she believed was the Knight of all Knights even if she was  tainted with the darkness. No, it was exactly because she was  tainted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  be tainted by the darkness meant giving away one’s conscience,  life, emotions, in exchange for immense power of destruction. One  tainted is given dark impulses, the desire to destroy… kill… and  fight. The love for the Priestess that spawned from the Dark Magess’  heart kept her sane. But without her… it destroyed will to stay  that way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  realized that it was the Dark Magess’ last act as the Priestess’  Sword and Shield… to leave… before she looses control.</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>Since  then…</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>Nearly  without rest, Amane trained and bettered herself…</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>Wishing  that one day, she will be strong enough…</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>To  find the dark one and bring her back…</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>to  the one she loved most… </strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>Because  she Hated her…</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>and  Loved her…</strong></em></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…</span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>End</strong></span></p>
<p align="center"><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>---</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Author’s  Final Notes: </strong>Yeah…  let’s see if I’ll feel like continuing this one. Maybe if this  story will get lots of fans I would. XD I hope you guys like the  twist. I know it’s kinda short and all. Not like my usual product.  I honestly… hate myself a bit for publishing an inferior work.  Hehehe… oh well! XD</span></p>
