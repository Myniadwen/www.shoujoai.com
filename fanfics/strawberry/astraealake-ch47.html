<p><em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But I remember now. </span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shut up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>When it comes to it, I’m different from them. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shut up, damnit!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And different from you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  felt that echo in her mind for the fiftieth time, biting her lip in  anger and frustration. Her fists balled, crumpling the blazer beneath  her touch as she watched Momomi leave the stable. She stepped forwards,  only to stop as Momomi was accosted by a score of other girls, all of  whom looked like they urgently wanted to talk to her. Kaname stalked  forwards, eyes locked on Momomi as she laughed casually at something  then replied. She was attracting a lot of attention, though, and cast  around with her eyes, settling on Kaname and giving her a pleading  look. Kaname’s protective instinct warred with her anger for a moment,  then one of the girls grabbed Momomi by the arm to attract her  attention and something snapped. Kaname stopped at the edge of the  circle, thrust the blazer in Momomi’s general direction, then turned  and stormed away, favouring the world around with an extremely dark  glare.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What the hell was that, charging in there like she  owned the place, attracting so much attention, and flattering all those  lice? God, it pisses me off! Why? Does she actually enjoy that crap at  all? I thought she didn’t care about normal people, so she why was she  acting like that? And in front of so many people, no less…that’s just  stupid. Is Amane really that important? Does she really want to spite  that badly? Is any of this my fault? Why the hell am I being punished  just because I don’t like her that way? How is that fair? She’s just  victimising me to gratify my own feelings! Trying to make me jealous  like that…and what’s even worse is that I am jealous! I’m angry beyond  belief! But that’s not because of her, that’s because she has to pick  Amane, doesn’t she? Why’s it always Amane? I still don’t see it at all,  what makes her so great? What makes her so worth Amane’s time? Even if  Momomi wants to be like this, couldn’t she pick someone, anyone else?  More importantly, why did Amane tolerate her? What’s so special about  Momomi, as opposed to anyone else?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em>different from you…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname punched the air in frustration. If there was a wall, she would have punched that instead. <em>It’s  so bloody annoying! Watching them like that, playing horse with  everyone watching as if they’re the same kind of person…I don’t even  recognise her. That’s not the Momomi I know! Being so isolated and  arrogant and pretentious, I’m different, what the hell was that? What’s  with her attitude? Am I supposed to be humbled, or something? Is it  impressive that she can just about ride a horse with people watching  her, and talk with Amane about whatever the hell it is they talked  about? What the hell did she want me to think? Am I supposed to be  jealous, when she’s being such an arrogant jerk? </em>Kaname hissed  through her teeth, infuriated she hadn’t spent any of her fury. It just  kept welling up from somewhere, every time she saw that image, the two  of them riding together. <em>Amane so perfect, Momomi so improvised but  still… something…graceful…fitting…not doing anything, not racing or  performing tricks, just trotting back and forwards…together. And  talking. Every time I remember that, it feels like a betrayal. And  because I’m jealous when she wants me to be jealous, it’s like I’m  betraying myself. And considering I reacted the way I did, it’s not  like she can’t know she got to me, either. She made a complete fool out  of me, and we both know. That’s what’s annoying around here! Why does  she have to go so far just to make a point? I…I like her company, I  know that, so why does she have to do this? It’s so pointless and  aggravating, so much so that I just wonder whether she’s doing it to  piss me off. Or does she really think this will help? Yes, I am  jealous… as a friend, I’m jealous, and I’m damn sure I have that right.  Why should she spend time with that bitch when she could be with me?  And why does she have to put on such a show, where all I do is watch  and hold her coat? Does she expect me to do that again? I’m not  everyone’s bloody servant; I’m not Amiki, I’m not going to sit in the  shadows and watch her race ahead of me. Not for her convenience, not  for anyone!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The rage still hadn’t gone, and Kaname recognised  it by now. She hadn’t felt like this since Momomi last betrayed her,  but once upon a time this was something she experienced every day of  every week. <em>No, that’s not exactly right. When Momomi betrayed me  like that, I was melancholy as much as I was angry, and it was a cold  fury, not this… choking…pervading sense of wrongness. I just want to  hurt something, someone, myself, inflicting pain, tearing, destroying,  all of that. I’ve felt like this before and flung myself at groups six  times my number, individuals six years my senior, everything, just to  feel alive. I have to hurt something with this rage before it eats me  from the inside out. I can’t just bear with it. That’s how I’m feeling  right now. It’s my darkest mood, when I’ve been betrayed. Betrayal.  That’s the word, when a friend goes against all of your principles and  all of your wishes, just to hurt you and gratify her own feelings. Even  after I told her, that I’d been betrayed again…she nodded so kindly,  then, she even held me, but she still did this. Everyone’s the same. No  one will stay perfect forever, that’s the way it is, isn’t it? </em>Kaname dug her nails into the palm of her hand, wishing that she could believe that. <em>Why  does this always happen to me? So I’m not a great person, I know that,  but what did I do to deserve this? So I don’t like Momomi, so what? Is  that so bad of me, to be human? Apparently so, for her at least. Why  else would she be acting like this?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Amane. That would be another reason. </em>Kaname allowed herself a malicious smirk. <em>That  stuck-up, cold bitch. I’d enjoy that, I’ll relish the imagining. I’d  punch her bloody face in, just to see her react. She thinks she can  turn away and pretend I don’t exist, but I’ll make her remember I’m  real. I’ll show her how real my hatred is. Even if she doesn’t  acknowledge me, I’ll make her bleed. You can’t just wish that way  because it’s poor or violent or common or normal, now can you? So she’s  different, but that cuts both ways, doesn’t it? Even if she has the  strength, she doesn’t have my viciousness. She doesn’t understand what  it is, to be smashed down and left to bleed by someone, everyone,  friends, foes, mother, father…she doesn’t know the feeling that flows  through your veins when you’re living for nothing but the desire to  hurt another human being. I’ll show her that. I’ll show her what it  means to feel pain, to be brought so low that she’s finally at my  level. She can realise that even if it’s a wretched fall from grace for  her, I’ve been living in that crap all this time. Then she’ll be the  one to know everything about differences and distance. I’d enjoy it. It  makes my palms itch just to think about it. She has everything, so I’ll  take something away from her. And I’m not going to forgive her if she  even tries to take Momomi away from me. Momomi’s mine, I was the one  who listened to her, supported her, stood by her, and protected her.  I’m the one who suffered for her. I don’t care what anyone thinks, I’ll  keep her to myself, even if that’s selfish. I have the right!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So why am I bothered? </em>That annoyingly persistent voice echoed in the back of her mind, probing her angry thoughts and cutting through them all. <em>Momomi’s  as fault, Momomi chose to socialise with Amane, Momomi annoyed me, so  why should I even want to be around her? Why is Amane’s fault that this  happened? Why aren’t I going to take this out on Momomi? Wouldn’t that  be the right thing to do? Isn’t that the person I’m really angry with.  I should punch her, and then… and then…</em>Kaname felt a curious melancholy. <em>I  can’t do that. I could never hurt her. Why? I have my pride, I suppose,  that’d be just like punching a child, no different from my parents…and  she’s curiously resistant to physical intimidation anyway, but…I still  couldn’t. If I did that, it would all break. I’d be like her father and  I’d have no right to be her friend. Even if she’s angered me, even if  she’s hurt me, even if she said what she said, Momomi isn’t someone I’m  going to hurt. She’s someone to protect. Why am I saying that right  now? Just because I don’t hurt her, that doesn’t mean I have to protect  her…</em>Kaname sighed, feeling her rage slowly ebb away. Now she tried  to keep hold of it. It reminded her of a simple, easy world, but it was  fading away. <em>But nothing’s changed. If I saw girls bullying her,  I’d still run in to save her. I’d still to fight to protect her. I’d  still put my body between her and any pain that might come her way, and  I’d still bleed to let her stand tall. Does that make me a good friend,  or an idiot, than I can think that even when I’m feeling like this? </em>Kaname scowled. <em>Idiot. Definitely.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  she reached the Japanese classroom, she threw herself into her chair in  the far corner and slumped forwards, resting her head against the desk  and sighing hugely. <em>…different from you…</em>Her eyes were hurting, and it was pissing her off. <em>I  remember days like this. I used to be like this all the time, and it  was wretched. If Momomi left, would I end up the same way again? Makes  me feel pathetic. This isn’t growth, it’s just dependency. If I think  straight, why the hell should I care that she spends twenty minutes  playing horse with Amane? There’s no good reason, but I do care, and  it’s really annoying me. She’s mine, the one I shared my past with and  the one who cares for me. I hate this feeling. The one which tells me  that all of that could turn to dust. I won’t accept that. </em>Kaname tried not to think about Amiki had said. She didn’t need that to worry about, on top of anything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She could hear them, though. She could hear them, and it was getting bloody annoying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  did you see Amane-san and Kaname’s girl, what was it… Momo? Momo  Phareli? You know, the girl who had her weird family round here on the  weekend…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See? See what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was there, it was so weird!  Amane-san was riding, just like always, and then that Momo came out on  a horse and joined her, just like that. And Amane-san let her! They  rode around together talking!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Amane-san and that girl? But she’s so strange…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. Not just that, either. She was riding one of Amane-san’s horses.  And Amane just accepted it. They must have agreed to meet there before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Amane talked with her? Amane doesn’t talk with anyone, least of all someone like that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what I thought, but perhaps we shouldn’t be so surprised. So no one’s  heard of her here, but my mother told me the Phareli are a big  aristocratic family in Italy after all, and she’s the second daughter.  If it’s just blood and money, she has the right quality to be with  Amane-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That girl? Even if you say that, she’s so quiet and  weird, I can’t see it at all. Besides, she’s a foreigner, isn’t she?  For someone like Amane-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.” Kaname glared at them. “You’re noisy. Stop annoying me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Conversation  in the room, much of which had been variants on that same theme,  stopped almost instantly. They turned to face her and she glowered  right back at them, daring them to say a word. She was almost sure they  were going to talk back, and then she’d snap at them, when the teacher  walked in and snapped at the last few people who were talking. They  turned away and the moment was gone, leaving Kaname with a displaced  sense of annoyance. <em>So even now, I’ll defend her. I wish I knew why. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  drifted through her lessons feeling very annoyed, quite angry, fairly  frustrated, and acutely aware that she was overreacting. <em>But it’s  not something I can help, nor is it something I’ll apologise for. I  have strong emotions and I’m not a person with the patience of a saint,  either. If I’m irritated, I’ll lash out at the source of the  irritation. That’s who I am. </em>She looked around and wished that she  actually had something to lash out at, but there was nothing. They  weren’t saying it any more, perhaps because they’d got the idea that  she would attack anyone who did. But still, it annoyed her. <em>All  that attention…for what? Because Momomi rode with Amane? What’s the big  deal? Why does everyone need to know? Why was it important? I’ve no  idea, they’re just reading too much into things. Even if Momomi is  bitter, she’s definitely not that fickle. If she was, she’d be a  pathetic person, and she’s not. I know that. But that doesn’t mean I  enjoy it either way. Like that… when she’s acting like that…I know she  said, she wanted to be popular. And I know she could. But even though I  agreed when she said it, I don’t like her acting like this. I don’t  like her just walking away and using Amane, I don’t like them all  talking about her either, I don’t like any of this. When it was just  the two of us, loafing around in our room, was that so bad? That’s  always been enough for me…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em>different from you…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  scowled deeply and tried to forget those words. She didn’t like the  sense of distance they gave her. Instead she looked out the window,  watching the clouds. Clouds were nice. That sufficed as an activity  until the bell rang. Kaname sighed and began to slide her books until  her bag. <em>A bag packed by Momomi…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You look broody, Kenjou.” Yuho leaned over her desk, glancing at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned and gave her a dark look, which the girl apparently ignored. “I’m not broody. I’m just in a bad mood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because of your Kiyashiki girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. Because annoying people who can’t take a hint keep bothering me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still impatient, I see. But that’s not important?” Yuho glanced at her. “What’s all this stuff about Kiyashiki and Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows? Ask them yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. Everyone knows you and Kiyashiki are joined at the waist.  Hell, I thought you two were together.” Yuho gave her a thoughtful  look. “Perhaps not, if some of the rumours are true…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s got nothing to do with you.” Kaname stood and threw her bag over her shoulders, turning away. “So forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be like that. I’m just curious. Is that so bad?” Yuho walked after her  as she exited the classroom, trying to keep up with Kaname’s long  stride.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop following me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will, when you tell me what you know. Is that so difficult?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not your business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that, anything concerned with Amane-san becomes everyone’s business. You can’t blame me, now can you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could care less. Go back to your friends or ask them yourselves. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God, you’re so boring…” Yuho sighed. “Isn’t it interesting? Amane-san with someone like Kiyashiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not with anything,” Kaname replied through gritted teeth. “Don’t get  too excited. They just talked and rode, that’s all. I don’t see why  everyone’s so enthusiastic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, perhaps you don’t know, but Amane-san won’t even talk to most people. That’s why it’s surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s so surprising about that?” Kaname closed her eyes. “I don’t like talking to most people, and that includes you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, but she’s different from you.” Yuho shook her head. “All the  same, I don’t get that Kiyashiki girl. What do you see in her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s it to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More curiosity. Your answer might help me understand what Amane-san sees in someone as weird as her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drop dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there’s no accounting for taste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stopped and snapped her head back, giving Yuho a killer glare. “Get out of my sight. Now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho  stepped back, apparently unimpressed. “You’re still very defensive of  her, aren’t you? Oh, well. Perhaps I will ask her myself. See you  around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.” Kaname growled and walked on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She found  Momomi outside her French classroom, talking to people. Kaname could  guess the topic of conversation, and didn’t want to deal with it right  now. She stopped just behind the group and pulled her arms out of her  pockets, folding her arms severely. “Momomi. Stop wasting time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be there in a second, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  hell.” Kaname pushed her way past one of Momomi’s classmates and  grabbed the brown-haired girl by the wrist. “Have you forgotten?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgotten what?” Momomi frowned. “Oh, of course. I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t have time to waste on unnecessary things.” Kaname dragged Momomi away without looking back. “This is serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It hurts, Kaname. I can walk, you know-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up.” She heard Momomi gasp behind her. “These exams are serious. I’m  going to get you through them, even if I have to drag you kicking and  screaming every step of the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that, and I’m indebted to you. So can you let go of me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And have you escape? Not likely.” Kaname snorted. “I’m sick of the sight of your new groupies already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  winced, trying to keep up with Kaname. “You’re unexpectedly forwards.  But they’re not groupies. They’re just curious, so you don’t have to  snap at anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Curious for a reason. That’s what annoys me.” Kaname glared at her friend. “Why did you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s eyes narrowed. “Why shouldn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  it’s bloody immature of you, that’s why. I thought you were smarter  than this.” Kaname looked away, gritting her teeth. “Playing around  with Amane just to annoy me-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just to annoy you? I did that  because you told me I couldn’t. You were the one annoying me.” Momomi  frowned. “You thought I couldn’t do it, but I could. If anything,  you’re the one being immature. You’re a sore loser, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s grip tightened. “Oh, I am, am I? I think you’re the sore loser around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  flushed angrily. “well, you’re wrong! I appreciate this may be news to  your ego, but the world doesn’t revolve around you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If not that, then why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, Amane’s interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you expect me to believe that’s the reason?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s up to you whether or not you choose to believe in the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “That’s some truth. Amane’s interesting… sounds like a huge lie on its own merits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what everyone says about you,” Momomi retorted. “I’d think that you  should be smart enough to know that she’s different beneath the  surface.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And aren’t you another person who says that normal people aren’t interesting?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you seriously telling me that Amane’s a normal person?” Momomi laughed. “Now that’s a lie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  you’re right.” Kaname’s face twisted. “Normal people at least care  about their wonderful lives. They’re not asocial horse-riding  egomaniacs, in short.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And she says that you’re a violent, antisocial bitch,” Momomi replied snappishly. “You can call each other what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? She said that, did she?” Kaname raised her eyebrows in fake calm. “You must have been having a pleasant conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  I told her she didn’t know anything.” Momomi pulled her hand free  angrily. “I’m not quite sure why, actually… but I did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t have to bother. I could care less what someone like her says about me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?” Momomi smirked. “Then why were you so annoyed at our <em>pleasant conversation</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not her. I’m not going to let you say what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That goes for you, as well. After the fiftieth time you insult Amane meaninglessly, it gets really very old. Knock it off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s it to you?” Kaname challenged. “Defending your new friend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing so grand.” Momomi flicked her hair disdainfully. “I just have to listen to my old friend, that’s why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, get used to me speaking like this. I won’t change for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  fine, if you’re going to be like that.” Momomi folded her arms. “I’ll  speak to her when I like, as well. She told me I could, and you don’t  have the right to stop me. She’s even agreed to lend me her horse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I have no right, do I?” Kaname was vaguely aware that they’d joined the  line in the canteen, but she didn’t care. That stuff didn’t matter.  “What the hell do I have to do, to have the right? I’ve been with you  all this time, I’ve supported you so many times, but she-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  does she have to do?” Momomi demanded icily. “I spent twenty minutes  talking with her, so what do you expect? You’re seriously overreacting.  Why does it even matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s because it’s with her, and you  know that’s an affront to me. You know how much I hate her. So why the  hell should I let you kick me in the teeth by prancing about with her  and pretending to be a princess?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not pretending anything,  and I’m not indebted to your hatred.” Momomi snorted. “What’s that got  to with me, Kaname? It’s never been sensible anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not a matter of sensible.” Kaname glared at her. “How would you like it if I started getting all chummy with your father?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a ridiculous comparison. What has she ever done to you, Kaname? Do  tell, because you never have before.” Momomi drew herself up. “Give me  a <em>single </em>thing she ever did to deserve you being a self-righteous prick about her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Self-righteous?  Aren’t you the self-righteous one yourself?” Kaname snarled. “Sitting  so prettily between us and defending each to other. Do you get a kick  out of that, pretending you’re so tolerant and broadminded?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not it. With Amane, there’s not even anything I need to tolerate. But,  as for broadminded… it’s really not hard to be more broadminded than  you two are. You’re both classist egotists, thinking you know best from  where you stand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, why shouldn’t I feel contempt for her? Has she ever lived in the real world? What does she know about anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her world’s mine,” Momomi said curtly. “I don’t relish it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not the issue here. I have good reasons to hate her, but she’s got no  good reasons to look down on me. She’s just an arrogant bitch!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So are you, what of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am  I wrong?” Momomi’s fists balled. “If that’s the case, you have good  reasons to hate me. If you blame me for my birth, you’re just  pathetically shallow. It’s the same from Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s too  bad that everyone thinks that way around here,” Kaname retorted. “Why  the hell should I like them when they look down on me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one asked you to like them, but you should tolerate them. You’re still overreacting, completely overreacting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  hell I am! Since when were you so arrogant? Well?” Kaname slammed a  hand against the metal surface next to her. “Do you even know what I’m  talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wasn’t arrogance,” Momomi retorted. “That  was fact. Because I’m not like you, someone who’ll watch from afar like  the tragic heroine!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You stuck up bitch!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m the bitch?  If you’re so jealous of the fact that your precious Amane-sama is  talking to someone for five minutes, go and confess to her.” Momomi  gave her a defiant look. “I <em>know </em>it’s not me you’re jealous of.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, you… are you that desperate for an excuse to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  the hell up. That’s enough.” Kariya glowered down at them from her  considerable height advantage. “Fighting like little kids, you’re way  too loud. If you’re so keen to tear each other to pieces, get the hell  out of here and find a room. Or whatever else you want to do there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etoile-sama,” Momomi murmured, apparently automatically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God,  it’s annoying. Hormonal teens like you two are the absolute worst.”  Kariya shook her head. “If you’re going to have a tiff, at least do it  out of sight. Have awareness of your surroundings!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Kariya-sama,” Kaname muttered sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bear  it in mind. Any more, and I’ll beat that into both of you.” Kariya  glared again. “Kenjou, I’m expecting you at the kendo club today. Don’t  let me down. I’ll give you advice, and show you what real swordsmanship  is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Advice about what, I wonder? Another counselling session  with Kariya-sensei, aren’t I the lucky one? At least Serané doesn’t  beat her points home with a sword…</em>Kaname nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good. Don’t forget, I’ll make you pay for it if you do.” Kariya walked away, skipping the queue.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  arrogant as ever…” Kaname growled, the moment she was out of earshot.  “She’s got a damn proprietary attitude for someone who won a popularity  contest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think that’s just the way she is, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. Annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having exhausted their current supply of common ground, they fell into a very tense silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi grabbed their lunches. “Where are we eating?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our room. Easier to study there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  should call this off. That would be best for both of us, and we won’t  learn anything if we’re working together with this mood. </em>Kaname  flicked a lock of her blue hair out of her eyes, feeling slightly ill  when she remembered that Momomi had brushed it only this morning. <em>But if I let her go, she’d just run off to Amane, wouldn’t she? Like hell I’m letting her do that. </em>“Right,” she agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What will we be studying?” Momomi asked, her voice dangerously constrained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure. Probably Japanese, that’s one of the hardest papers.” Kaname  made an equal effort to keep her voice neutral. “That’s one of your  strengths, though, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right. Creative writing and comprehension, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Creative writing is one of my weaker areas. I just concentrate on the technical side of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s one of the only things you can train about it,” Momomi agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”  Kaname took a deep breath, trying to cool herself down. Unfortunately,  she’d been interrupted in mid-flow, and wasn’t very sure how to deal  with the aftermath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do we get tested in sports or anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.  Well, unless you want a sports scholarship. But they’re a fraction of  the money.” Kaname sighed. “I don’t actually have one of those. It  requires you to do sport, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you could get paid to do sports? I don’t see why you don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s boring and tiring, even for me. A lot of sports, I don’t see the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I suppose they don’t have a scholarship for freestyle fighting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They don’t, no.” Kaname closed her eyes for a moment. “Probably a good thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  bore with the silence until they reached their room, then she pushed  open the door and flung herself onto her bed, burying her face in the  pillow for a moment and relaxing slightly. <em>Even now, this room’s a sanctuary. Perhaps… this is even a place I could call home. </em>Kaname frowned. <em>That was a badly timed revelation.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  closed the door behind her and walked slowly over to her own bed,  sitting on it and placing her bento next to her. “So, what now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  pulled her Japanese textbook out of her bag and balanced it on her  knees. “Right now, just look at a poem or whatever, and bounce analysis  off each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure. Sounds easy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Later, we’ll go to the library and get what we need.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do we need?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Textbooks aimed at the higher years. More general texts. And a lot of paper. This isn’t an easy exam, like I said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve gathered,” Momomi said dryly. “You’ve made it sound very scary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if it wasn’t you, I wouldn’t even bother. Your grades mean you actually stand a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My grades are worse than other people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t try, though. You’re just coasting on your native intelligence.”  Kaname flicked through the pages of her textbook, trying to find a  decent poem. “I know because I do it too. But that won’t be enough for  this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, already. You sound like a teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, in a manner of speaking, I am a teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.” Momomi smiled. “Shall I call you Kaname-sensei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  frowned and sighed, relaxing a little more at her light tone. “You  know, I’ve been on the receiving end of about every title except chan.  Would it hurt to call me what girls normally call their friends?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi cocked her head. “I don’t know. It just doesn’t seem to work for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grunted. “Too bad. Just as long as it’s not kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a shame. Kun suits you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God damnit, this again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t  you glad?” Momomi pouted. “I still remember when I told you about me…  you went on your little tirade about how you’ll be like a boy because  that’s where the power lies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that doesn’t mean I want to be treated like one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “I suppose not…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it doesn’t matter.” Kaname opened her bento. <em>Actually, if I’m honest, I think I like it. Just a little.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. That’s good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked up, glad her friend was still leafing through her own textbook.  She glanced away and spoke casually. “Say… what kind of title suits  Amane, in your opinion? Kun again? She looks like me, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked up and smiled. “Amane-san. Definitely.”</span></p>
