<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>Momomi stood  and walked across the room, putting a hand on her hip and looking down  at a sleeping Kaname. She smiled affectionately. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ever the cute  idiot, sleeping so deeply…I wonder what she dreams about. Do I even  want to know that? It probably involves Amane and violence, if this is  my poor, serious Kaname we’re talking about. </span></em>She leaned forwards,  intending to shake her awake, when a more interesting alternative  occurred to her. She knelt and rested her chin on the bed, level with  Kaname’s face. Gently, she reached out and touched the girl’s cheeks.  “Wake up… Ka-na-me…”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname made a small noise and shifted, her eyes  fluttering open. Crimson eyes gazed into brown for a moment, and then  she blinked and threw herself backwards, instinctively dragging the  covers up over her body. “Argh! What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “My, my. That was a lot funnier than I’d thought it would be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now my heart’s beating way too fast,” Kaname muttered. “Don’t do things like that, it’s scary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, don’t be so fussy. You should concentrate on the positives. You’re wide awake now, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, but I’m sure an adrenaline rush in the morning isn’t good for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s probably healthier than coffee.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow  I doubt that… whatever it does to my body, my nerves aren’t happy with  you.” Kaname sat up, sighing. “In any case, expect me to return that  favour at the next possible opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi leaned forwards, kissing her on the nose briefly. “I’ll anticipate it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha.” Kaname looked away, flushing slightly. “You’ve got even cockier, you do know that, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s because I have a beautiful girlfriend,” Momomi replied, standing and offering her hand. “That would boost anyone’s ego.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  for subtlety, are you?” Kaname took her hand and pulled herself out of  bed, yawning slightly. “Well, I’ll have to get used to that now, I  suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t the moniker unsubtle suit you better?” Momomi teased. “Let’s be honest here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. Just don’t make me mention all the things I could be calling you right now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re cute when you complain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re uncute when you disturb my well-earnest rest. Though uncute is probably only a word very early in the morning…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  be quiet and put our clothes out,” Momomi said affectionately. “Let’s  save the sparring for when our minds are with the program, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, I agree.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  found herself humming as she stepped into the bathroom, a little  toneless tune of no significance. She stopped the moment she realised,  slapping her hands twice against her cheeks in punishment before  busying herself with the taps. <em>Now, now, Momomi. Don’t completely  lose your wits. It’s not good for someone like me to be acting like a  ditzy teenager in love… and there’s that scary word again. I’m not  comfortable with saying that. It feels like I’m inflating my own  feelings and boosting my ego needlessly. But whatever it is, it makes  me pretty happy and appears to drain my IQ by around five points a day.  At this rate, I’ll be a dribbling fairy who spends her days writing  sappy love poetry. Not an enviable destiny. And besides, this is Kaname  I’m talking about. For all her wonderful qualities, she’s a very long  way from a fairytale prince that girls dream about. Sure, she may be  smart, strong, sporty, talented, delightfully possessive, hilariously  cute, gratifyingly protective, sincere to me, caring to me, patient  with me… even when she’s not that with anyone else, which makes it even  better… but…I’m sure I was going somewhere with this. Never mind. </em>Momomi  smiled a little foolishly and splashed more cold water over her face  than was strictly necessary. She laughed at her reflection, shaking her  head vigorously then picking up a towel. <em>Yeah, I’ve got it pretty  bad. How embarrassing. But still, it’s just a lot more fun to be with  Kaname. Even more enjoyable than things were before. I mean, obviously  kissing is nice, but it’s something more than that. I’m not sure. I  guess it’s the feeling of licence. Everything we did before, the casual  touches, the hugs, the smiles, now they’re more meaningful, more  legitimate, supported by a mutual understanding. She’s mine, I’m hers,  and this is something we share. If I can call even a little bit of  Kaname mine, I’m happy.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They got dressed and ready quickly  and in silence, a comfortable silence. Momomi had noticed that Kaname  was taking a little more care when she got changed, always trying to be  out of sight. <em>That’s strangely gratifying. After all, walls have to built up before they can be torn down. </em>Then  Kaname sat, relaxing in front of the mirror. Momomi stood behind her  and smiled, running her hands briefly through the azure tangle before  she picked up the comb. “Jeez, why does hair that short get so tangled?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rather,  I keep it this short because it gets so tangled,” Kaname explained.  “Though I’m sure it doesn’t mind being spoiled by you every day as a  result, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled, getting to work. “Is it normal to talk about your hair as a sentient creature?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well, in my case I’m not as convinced as I’d otherwise be that it isn’t  one,” Kaname deadpanned. “Can you categorically prove that it isn’t an  independent organism roosting on my head? It certainly doesn’t act on  my will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, well, quite a few bodyparts are like that, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you say that, the others don’t tie themselves in knots and attempt  to throttle me to death.” Kaname placed her hands on her legs. “Of  course, your hair is similar.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t those qualities common to all hair, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little. But they’re still very difficult. Your hair is long, sleek and  cool, like a big cat or something.” Kaname smirked. “Though to be  honest, a self-satisfied cat is a good metaphor for you generally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An intelligent and independent animal who always has a certain aura, the one that says I don’t <em>really </em>need  my masters.” Momomi smiled. “I could live with that. It’s fairly apt.  Though I’m sure you cast me as something else before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Perhaps. As for my hair, something stubborn, prickly and defensive, I suppose-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like a Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very funny. You know, I was thinking something more like a wolf.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or a hedgehog,” Momomi suggested innocently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared. “I don’t think they quite convey the right aura, you know, if you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re everything you said, though. No creature’s more prickly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s nice. They’re still roadkill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not a problem. There aren’t any roads near the dorms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly the point.” Kaname snorted. “Don’t make me recast you as a dormouse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know, you’re the sleepy one.” Momomi caressed Kaname’s scalp. “But let’s not take this too seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rubbed her nose, leaning back. “As ever, you enjoy having the last word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you the same?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. That’s the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t it better for both of us if we go without saying it, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the contrary, that’s something we have to say precisely because it’s true for both of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do we gain from that, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The self-conscious realisation of just how ridiculous we are.” Kaname’s reflection grinned, eyes lively and amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled back. “That’s true enough, I suppose. It’s definitely something we need to be reminded of from time to time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, our erstwhile friends are very reliable for that, even without us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  we do it right back, now don’t we?” Momomi observed, dropping her head  and whispering. “Especially you, as I recall, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  closed her eyes momentarily, cocking her head slightly. “Yeah.  Honestly, do we call such a frank discourse true friendship or just a  lot of ugly name-calling?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Both. As far as I can tell, the two are one and the same.” Momomi stroked her hair. “Don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  judge by us two, that certainly makes sense,” Kaname agreed. “Though  I’m sure I’d rather pretend that something more sane and less circular  exists out there somewhere…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps, but a lot of things  probably exist out there somewhere. Until we’ve uncovered pure,  unadulterated true friendship from a mine shaft somewhere, we’ll have  to manage on these poor makeshifts, won’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. When you  put it that way, there’s more heart in this way. Only an idiot would  chase after hypothetical perfection. It’s better to settle for what is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Nice to know I’m your second-best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure I don’t rank any higher.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  you rank lower, if we’re considering hypothetical entities anyway.”  Momomi set the comb aside and slid her arms round Kaname’s neck. “But  you’re right. It’s best if we concentrate on the things we can hold in  our hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite.” Kaname looked at her reflection in  amusement, blue hair framed by Momomi’s body and the brown hair  spilling untidily over her shoulders. “I need a haircut, actually. You  do too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a good point. I’m not sure how we do that, though. My sister always used to cut my hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hold  on a second. Is this Luigia? It can’t be, can it? It’s like she can do  anything. This is your bastard half-sister by a maid, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think so,” Momomi replied, feigning a thoughtful face. “She just  liked to do these things for me. Of course, I was generally stolen by  my mother afterwards for damage control with professionals.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I wouldn’t mind cutting out the middleman. If you’re leading up to you  cutting my hair… I’m not cruel enough to subject even this alien  parasite to your attentions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You certainly haven’t lost your  blunt streak,” Momomi complained. “But you’re right, that’d probably be  too much even for me. Still, though, with your hair, how badly wrong  could I go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. But I’m not too inclined to find out, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Well, my mother’s saloons are rather out of our price range. How about you? Where did you go to do your hair?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “My mother cut it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “I see… was she any good at it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shook her head. “She was terrible. But she said she wasn’t going to  waste the money on a proper haircut for me. Even though I found that  unfair, I know what she means.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “That’s a real shame. It’s at times like this, though, when I remember how different our backgrounds are…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t bother thinking about it. It’s annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  nodded. “Of course, don’t worry. I’m not the kind to go on stupid guilt  trips about where I come from, even if I don’t like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise. But you only draw more attention to it, so forget it.” Kaname stood. “In any case, I’ll do you now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat, bowing her head slightly. “You look thoughtful,” she commented.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, right…” Kaname shook her head. “I’m just remembering things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do tell.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not important. Just a few random thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned and said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,  well, where do I begin?” Kaname sighed, looking thoughtful. “My mother  hated me. I know that. She always let me understand I was the worst  thing that ever happened to her, her sin, a child she shouldn’t have  and shouldn’t kill, a burden and her greatest shame of all… nothing she  could take pride in, for all of my fragmented brilliance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced at her reflection with worried eyes. “Was it really that bad?  It’s hard to believe that someone could truly hate their own child for  no good reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be too naïve. It’s possible, and she even had reasons, of a kind.” Kaname’s scowl deepened. “But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  still looked after me.” Kaname shook her head. “It took me a while to  grasp the significance of that. She could have given me up for  adoption. Heck, if people had cared, I could have been torn from her by  a court of law as well. But, for everything, for all her spite and all  her venom and all the difficulty I caused her, she did care for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s free hand curled into a fist. “You know, somehow, that really pisses me off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know what you mean. Somehow, it’s easier to hate someone than to try and reconcile their sins with their few good points.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  smirked. “That must be why we have so few friends. But still, I’ve  always wondered why… not out of love. I know that much. Duty? Religion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged. “Perhaps religion is it. It can make people act in certain  ways, for good and for ill alike. But you’d know better than me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wish that was true. It’s a bloody mystery for me. She’s always been  that to me.” Kaname’s expression darkened. “But still, she shouldn’t  have treated me like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned, touching her hand. “It’s alright now, though, isn’t it? Where we’re going is more important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s  face relaxed slightly as she looked down. “I guess so. She does not  define me, after all. I just remember. Pretty messed up, isn’t it? All  of this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re both pretty messed up. But we need happiness too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  finished in silence before picking up their things and heading out.  “You know,” Kaname said after a few steps. “Do you have to go and see  Amane today? Can’t you skip for once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, what’s this? Still jealous?” Momomi teased. “I’m very flattered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. So I’m jealous. But still, you talked to her to try to get me jealous, so can’t you stop already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  wasn’t just to get you jealous, you know.” Momomi smiled. “I didn’t  think that’d achieve anything, but I needed something to take my mind  off things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “That’s hardly the point…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m friends with Amane now. Besides, it’s only for a few minutes, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, you spent like an hour with her yesterday. You owe me, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  so, it’d be dishonest if I didn’t turn up without warning her, wouldn’t  it?” Momomi looked at her. “And she is a friend, you know. Even if  we’re together, we can have friends as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned,  folding her arms. “I know. But still, I don’t trust her. More  importantly, it’s hardly fair. At least I’m always with you when you’re  talking to the others, and you’re always with me, but I can hardly  follow you with Amane. I can’t ride a horse and I can’t stand her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s only half an hour a day, Kaname. Be reasonable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s the point, though. It was a lot longer yesterday, and I’d rather that didn’t become a habit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shook her head. “Oh, come on. Even yesterday wasn’t too bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We went on our first date the day before,” Kaname complained. “Even if you say that, isn’t this a time to spoil me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’ve had that argument yesterday, haven’t we? I should still see Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly,  would she miss you even if you didn’t come?” Kaname snorted. “This is  the aloof bitch who doesn’t care about anything or anyone. She wouldn’t  mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just how she likes to be seen, you know,” Momomi  replied. “As far as I can tell, she’s actually quite lonely and  vulnerable. Even if she wasn’t, it still wouldn’t justify me skipping.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  isn’t an appointment, already! Jeez. Can’t you just do it, already? As  a favour to me.” Kaname huffed. “I’ll definitely bug you until you do,  anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, at this rate there won’t be any time left.”  Momomi glanced sidelong at her friend. “But still, as a favour to you,  is it? Do you enjoy my company that much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Say what you like. I just don’t like you spending time with that stuck-up, spoiled prince.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so, Kaname. As a favour, though… you’d definitely owe me something, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah.” Kaname glanced at her cautiously. “Nothing too big, though. As you said, it’s a small thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “I see. Well, say please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You heard me. It’s polite when asking for favours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets. “Fine. Please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, no. What are you asking for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For you to eat breakfast with the rest of us, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shook her head. “Nope. You have to put the two together, you see. That’s how it goes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Now you’re just pissing me off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can always go and see Amane…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright!  I get it already.” Kaname sighed theatrically. “I, Kaname Kenjou,  respectfully request that you go with me to the canteen,  Kiyashiki-sama. Like that? Or should I beg a bit?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. That’s just fine, thank you.” Momomi smiled. “That wasn’t so hard, now was it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gritted her teeth. “Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  they reached the canteen, Momomi’s gaze darted sideways, stopping on  their table. Kaname followed her eyes then stopped. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything wrong?” Momomi asked, as innocently as she could manage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell is she doing here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if she’s coming back here anyway, it makes sense, don’t you think?”  Momomi pointed out. “Besides, it’s more social. It’ll be good for her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re looking mighty smug,” Kaname accused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname folded her arms, huffing. “You knew all along, didn’t you? You knew she’d be in here after all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s not be too noisy,” Momomi said. “Don’t you remember what happened the last time we had a blazing row in public?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Screw that!” Kaname snapped. “I’m pissed off, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was just teasing you a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, this wouldn’t happen if you weren’t so dishonest,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re calling me dishonest? That’s beyond hypocrisy right now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it’s you, you won’t admit your own feelings unless I deceive you,”  Momomi retorted, annoyed. “Is it so bad to want you to say you’d miss  me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You weren’t a lot further than that, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me. That’ll be the last time for a while that you’ll say anything, I thought I’d make it good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then shouldn’t you be the one to ask nicely instead of lying to me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now you’re just being disproportionate!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were the one who took it too far just now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They glared at each other, folding their arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A lover’s tiff already?” Shion murmured from behind them. They both jumped and turned around.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed and threw up her hands. “I thought that might have been the  case. Well, carry on, by all means. It’s good to get this out of your  systems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scowled. “With you here? Shouldn’t you be talking to Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, don’t mind me,” Shion remarked. “I just happen to be around. Carry on as you were before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Fine. We’ll get our breakfasts, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They didn’t apologise, or say anything about it at all. That was how they did things, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat down with the others, nodding politely. “Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The lovers are as noisy as ever,” Amiki remarked. “I’d say get a room, but you have a room, you just don’t use it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah,” Kaname replied. “I was bored when Shion was talking about it. Forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  your life.” Amiki shrugged and shook her head. “You two are definitely  way too loud, though. Can’t you just kiss and make up, or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  any time you feel like disagreeing with Olesa in the smallest detail  would be fine too,” Kaname retorted. “At least I have free will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  have no self-control, that’s your problem. Even if you call it freedom,  the freedom to argue loudly and pointlessly isn’t anything to be proud  of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And being a sycophant is something to be proud of now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed. “You all get exponentially more animated when these two arrive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re  an important part of the chemistry, somehow,” Shion said. “I’m not  quite sure why, but that’s the way it is. It’s interesting, if nothing  else. I guess opposites attract.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s simple.” Kaname picked up  her chopsticks. “Even if opposites attract, that’s what you get in an  atom, the balance of two opposed forces… when matter and antimatter  meets, there’s a big explosion. That’s us four.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion sighed. “Depressingly, that actually makes some sense for you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’re a neutron, along with Amane, because you don’t really contribute much either way,” Kaname observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  very cruel of you, Kaname. Besides, I disagree with your assessment.”  Shion closed her eyes. “I’m the outside observer, who determines the  state of something. Without me, all your bickering would be very  pointless and futile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, it’s pretty futile even if you’re here,” Momomi said. “And this is me saying that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I take it Physics has been the latest study for your exams,” Olesa commented.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned and nodded. “Now you put it that way, this makes a lot more sense…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t have anything to do with that,” Shion retorted, folding her arms. “I just know things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname absently fed Momomi a pickle. “You know things on the third year syllabus, certainly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed. “You really do have an unhealthy insight into this stuff.  What’s the point of you attending the later years if you cram them for  a test to get to the later years?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Beats me. Ask the Etoiles. I just screw the system as best I can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “Why are people staring at us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Momomi looked around and sighed. “Oh, right. Well, shouldn’t you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  shook her head. “None of us are doing anything interesting. We’re just  eating and talking. There isn’t anything to stare at here, is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shouldn’t you be used to this by now?” Kaname groused. “It’s your fault, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why? I’m not riding a horse or anything.” Amane sighed. “I don’t really get it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t matter very much whether you’re riding a horse or not,” Momomi replied carefully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More  importantly, people find it strange that you’re talking to us, of all  people,” Shion said matter-of-factly. “It’s a mixture of jealousy and  resentment worsened by our perceived flaws as eccentric people. As  Kenjou-kun says, this is probably something you should expect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So this is my fault? I see…” Amane closed her eyes. “How irritating. It’s not like I’m doing anything abnormal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t  you just tell them to shut up or something?” Kaname asked. “I’d been  blocking it out, but now you’ve drawn attention to it, can’t you just  tell them to look away and shut the hell up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “That would be impolite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s impolite to stare, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not my business. Besides, they don’t generally listen to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not?” Amiki asked. “Forgive me for sounding like Kaname, but you’re like their God. Just tell them, thou shalt not stare.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane snorted, her expression dark. “I’d kill to make things that simple, you know. It’s not like I enjoy this either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed and leaned backwards. “You’re all being a little naïve. For  those people who the public has decided to idolise, it’s not a  completely happy fate. Even if they respect and worship the person,  they won’t respect any stated boundaries. People criticise paparazzi  all the damn time, but they still buy the newspapers filled with those  stories. They’re hypocritical like that. And whatever Ohtori-san  actually wants, they’ll do what they like while protesting their  innocence.” She shrugged. “As my father said, if it sells copies it  will be done. If journalists are guilty, the public isn’t innocent  either. But the cult of celebrity lives on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This would be where you get your dominating traits from,” Momomi observed. “Those are some pretty handy self-justifications.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smugness aside, you take my point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Momomi agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well, forgive me for not feeling sorry for those celebrities or Amane  either,” Kaname snorted. “They’re more than recompensed for the oh-so  dire inconvenience of a lot of attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have a point.”  Amane leaned forwards pensively. “All the same, I can’t say I  particularly enjoy the situation. I would much rather have a quieter  life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it does have it’s advantages,” Shion said. “You  just need to be better at harnessing them, Ohtori-san. I make use of my  young friends, even these young friends around me in small ways. For  someone like you, you’d never have to buy lunch again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you could collect a year’s worth of chocolate on Valentine’s day,” Amiki added. “That would be pretty nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  people would kill to have the privilege of helping you do chores in the  stables, even cleaning out the dung.” Momomi frowned thoughtfully.  “That would be pretty convenient, actually?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed. “Am I the only one who finds that kind of thing tiring?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably,” Amiki said casually. “But what can you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you could have people paying to clean your-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  wasn’t quite sure how Kaname intended that sentence, but she kicked her  and stuck a large piece of fish in her mouth just in case.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, the other thing about the cult of personality is how fickle it  is,” Shion observed. “People like a villain as much as they do a hero,  Ohtori-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. Well, if I was hated, that would be easier…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up,” Kaname snapped. “You don’t have any right to say that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki sighed. “Do you have to be so confrontational, Kaname? It’s getting pretty annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s right. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked and smiled. “She’s not really bothered, you know. Don’t take us too seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  snorted. “Speak for yourself. I get irritated when someone like her  says something like that. That’s just the worst kind of coddled  presumption.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “Well, however justified, your jealousy is also more than a little obnoxious…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bridled. “Why, you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  smiled pleasantly. “Let’s just move on, shall we? As for your original  question, Ohtori-san, you shouldn’t worry about it. As my father would  say, a new story is the next beat in the heart of the press… or, in  other words, people have short attention spans. If, indeed, you make a  habit of this, or even if you don’t, they will come to dismiss it as  normal and move on. You simply have to ignore them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “Even though, this must be troublesome for you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve had worse,” Kaname grunted. “A lot worse. Don’t worry yourself to death in your guilty-aristocrat way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname,  you should be more polite.” Momomi smiled at Amane. “Don’t worry about  it. A lot of people are jealous of us, after all. It’s rather fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane nodded once, closing her eyes. “I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  really aren’t the people you should be worrying about,” Amiki  commented. “But how about you? Not to be unfriendly or anything, but I  don’t quite follow why you’re talking to us of all people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I was bored.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but why us? Specifically?” Momomi asked. “I think that’s what she means.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t answer that,” Olesa said. “We only have a finite amount of time before morning lessons begin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Don’t talk about us as if you’re not involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still over-defensive. It’s a pity. I was hoping your relationship would mature you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, you’re a fine one to talk!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes, that’s fine. Play nice, children.” Shion sighed. “This is what I do, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  gets pretty annoying when you’re the one acting like you’re above us,  too,” Kaname said. “After all, you’re the one who began stalking us in  the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean I was kind enough to nice two complete-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just sighed loudly, cutting them both off. “We’re all arrogant losers? Can we settle for that and move on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane folded her hands and looked up at Momomi. “Can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Momomi said, casually feeding Kaname some more fish.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Were you arguing about me earlier?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Not at all, really, no…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It sounded like you were,” Amane said doubtfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  was just those two being stupid idiots,” Amiki said. “It’s nothing to  worry about, they’re just like that. Possibly constant arguments is  something they do so they can make up a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, thank you,” Momomi muttered. “But it was basically my fault. Plus Kaname’s over-sensitivity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted loudly and said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane glanced at them for a few moments, then nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  touch on another subject, we’ve managed to finalise the date of the  auditions.” Shion smiled broadly, eyes glittering. “They’ll be next  Saturday. If you two can finish the script before then, that would be  great, but we can always just go with what we have. We really want to  get moving if we’re going to have enough time to rehearse properly,  though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned. “As ever, you’re pushing us way too hard. But fine. I’ll see what I can do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa nodded. “It should be possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good, as expected of you two.” Shion smiled. “You’re both very talented. I’m lucky that I found you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  Well, flattery won’t make us work any faster. We’re at our limit  already.” Momomi snorted. “But not for you. We have our pride, you  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I’ll await the final manuscript with high  expectations.” Shion leaned forwards. “You know, Eida-san wasn’t sure  whether you two were the best choices for the job. I’m looking forwards  to proving her wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. “No need to anticipate that. It’s simply something that will happen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  confident as ever. That’s good.” Shion grinned. “But like I said  before, I’m expecting to see you both at the rehearsals as well. I want  to see how far your talents go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I told you before, as a  matter of favours this ends with the script, doesn’t it?” Momomi smiled  back. “If I’m interested in anything from there on in, it’ll be my own  decision.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. That’s why it’s important.” Shion nodded.  “But for someone like you, who wants recognition and popularity, this  is a great chance. To star in the play you wrote, that would be very  dramatic indeed…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. And I suppose if you find great  scriptwriters who also happen to be good actors, that reflects well on  you too,” Momomi replied. “And your year, which wants this play to be a  success, will be most impressed. Something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  groaned. “Shut up. You’re being really boring, you know. Who cares  about reading out some lines on stage in a stupid play, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m expecting you to turn up as well, Kenjou-kun. You have a good voice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why the hell would I do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  it’s a good way to keep up with your Momomi.” Shion smirked. “Besides,  I have the perfect part for you. If you’re good enough…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, you’re relying on them, aren’t you?” Olesa observed. “I won’t  get involved. I’ve no desire to take to the stage. But you’re placing a  lot of faith in them both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally. I believe in them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, caught a little off-guard by that statement. “You certainly know how to exploit people…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just want you to help me to help you. That’s all.” Shion glanced at  Amane. “And of course we have a part for you as well. I know it isn’t  really your style, Ohtori-san, but it would be excellent for us both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I’ll think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll think about anything,” Kaname muttered. “It’s coming up with the right answer that is the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  nodded briefly. “For now, I’ll take my leave.” She stood. “But if at  any time it could become possible for us to have a longer, private  conversation, Kiyashiki-san, I would be grateful for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Uh… I’ll see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have a good day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion frowned. “As ever, she’s an enigmatic girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rubbed her forehead. “You don’t have to tell me that. Say, Olesa, do you know what’s going on in her head?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa frowned, watching the blue-haired girl leave. “Perhaps jealousy. I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Jealousy of what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa just shrugged. “You should know better than me.”</span></p>
