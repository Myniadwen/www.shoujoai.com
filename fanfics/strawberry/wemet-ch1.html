<p>Rokujou  Miyuki was never frightened. That was what she liked to tell herself,  and let everyone believe. She was after all, President of the St.  Miatre Student Council, the cool, composed, and competent model  student, whose exacting standards fell equally harshly upon herself and  on those around her, regardless of rank or status. She was one of the  few people, if not the only person, who could push the well-loved and  respected Etoile-sama around with impunity, although whether or not  said Etoile responded to her pushing was still in question. Although,  she reflected, most times Shizuma just blatantly ignored her advice, at  least on the surface. Still, Rokujou-sama was the only one daring  enough to even chide the great Etoile-sama right in her face, other  than a certain red-haired transfer student, one Aoi Nagisa. Even then,  only the Miatre <em>seitokaichou</em> addressed Shizuma on more or less  equal terms, a probable result of rooming with the same Etoile for as  long as they had been at the Ichigo-sha.</p>
<p><em>Shizuma...</em> The  name echoed in the vaults of her mind like a silent prayer whispered to  the winds. It sounded special, even when unspoken, a precious gem to be  savored and admired. Shizuma was special, and that had nothing to do  with whether she was the Etoile or not. Shizuma had always been  perfection itself, even from when they first met as young children,  first years at St. Miatre Girls' Academy. Perfection was maintained, a  silent grace and strength radiating like an aura of quiet confidence  from that composed silver haired girl, no matter how tumultuous her own  emotions. <em>Even when broken...</em> Miyuki mused, calmly dipping her  quill in the ink bottle in front of her, before returning to attend to  the mountain of paperwork awaiting her, her hand moving with controlled  strength, filling up the lines with her elegant script.</p>
<p>There had  never been any doubt in Miyuki's mind that Shizuma would become Etoile  in the future, even as first years in Miatre. There was something about  that girl, something unique, that drew people to admire her, be in awe  of that epitome of cool grace and elegance. She herself had been  momentarily stunned by that silver haired beauty when they were first  introduced as roommates, having been then quite tongue-tied at the  sight of the other girl, and was unable to even string together  coherent sentences to respond to her new roommate.</p>
<p><em>The silver  waves in front of her were utterly captivating, and young Rokujou  Miyuki stared, wide-eyed, at the perfection that rose out of those  shimmering silver curtains like a goddess out of the sea. Unknowingly,  she flushed, uncertain of what she was going to say at that point in  time. </em>'This is going to be my roommate?'<em> she thought, peeking  nervously up through her bangs to study that portrait of grace before  her, awed by the promise of great beauty written within those innocent  features.</em></p>
<p><em>Her soon-to-be roommate smiled at her, and it  was then that the pooling sunlight from the window paled in comparison  to that simple gesture. Flushing even more deeply, she looked quickly  away, finding the minute stitches that made up the carpet beneath her  feet utterly captivating.</em></p>
<p><em>The angel before her spoke then, and she could actually </em>feel<em> the smile through the words. &quot;Hello, my name is Hanazono Shizuma, and it's nice to meet you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>She  knew she was supposed to speak then, but words failed her. Her numbed  mind struggled fervently to wrestle a coherent response to the simple  introduction, but all she could managed was a few half-strangled  squeaks that emerged from her throat. Blushing deeply in embarrassment,  she shrank deeper into herself, wishing then that the delicate  stitching on the carpet would just absorb her into the finely woven  tapestry, the better to hide her from that unbearable scrutiny from the  child-goddess before her.</em></p>
<p><em>Never breaking that tiny half smile on her face, Shizuma prompted her shy roommate quietly. &quot;Your name is...?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Startled  into a conditioned response, as should have been expected from a well  bred girl from a respectable family, Miyuki blurted out her response. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Ro-Rokujou Miyuki desu!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>As  if all her senses were on high alert, she could actually feel Shizuma's  smile grow just a tiny bit wider. Uncertainly, she looked up, steeling  herself as best as she could against the expected charisma practically  flowing in undulating waves from her fellow first year student. </em>'How does she do this?'<em> Miyuki wondered.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Well,  I'm happy that I got you as my roommate Rokujou-san. You seem like a  nice person.&quot; Shizuma paused, as if thinking something over. Miyuki  idly wondered what it could be as she fingered the hem of her uniform  nervously, unsure of exactly what to say in such a situation. She  mentally berated herself for such cowardly indecision. Was she not a  scion of the proud Rokujou family? She was raised to be better than a  shy, timid little girl. She was supposed to be like...this little image  of perfection standing before her. She was still in the midst of  administering a stern lecture to herself when Shizuma spoke again.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Since  we're going to be roommates, why not we drop the formalities? Do you  mind if I call you Miyuki?&quot; There it was again, that calming, melodic  voice. Miyuki blinked, her little reverie interrupted.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Anou...&quot; She quickly replayed Shizuma's words in her head. &quot;Of course...it's not a problem, Hanazono-san.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Shizuma.&quot;  Miyuki stared straight at the silver haired girl for the first time,  uncomprehending. Shizuma smiled benignly. &quot;Please call me Shizuma,  Miyuki-san.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh...right...then...umm...Shizuma-san?&quot;  Miyuki repeated that name carefully, as if it were a precious piece of  dessert to be savored, or something akin to what clear, spring water  was to a man dying of thirst in a desert. Shizuma smiled wider, an  honest, heartfelt smile that Miyuki felt obliged to return with one as  sincere as given to her.</em></p>
<p><em>And then Shizuma took her hand, and thus began their journey together as friends and roommates at St. Miatre Girls' Academy.</em></p>
<p>Miyuki  frowned briefly, her hand subtly tightening around the delicate quill  in her hand as she rewound that old memory. Had she ever been so  terribly shy and vulnerable? <em>Yes</em>, whispered that little voice in the back of her head. <em>Shut up</em>,  she replied just a little snappily to it. The voice of her conscience  promptly quietened, but not before giggling in a very familiar way. The  subsequent frown adorning her forehead caused the appearance of deep  wrinkles, something Shizuma would surely tease her for in that  infuriating way of hers. She didn't really care, after all, no one else  was in the Student Council Room at this time, and she didn't need any  reminder of how eeriely the little voice of her subconscious sounded  exactly like one Hanazono Shizuma...</p>
<p>Yes, Shizuma had left an  indelible mark on her life, one that she would carry with her all her  life, no matter where she went or did after graduation. The silver  haired Etoile had that sort of effect on people. Of course, Miyuki  could claim with all seriousness that she was one of the few people  Shizuma would call a real friend, an equal, even. Although Miyuki had  never considered herself to be a proper equal to Shizuma, only content  to stay by her side as a silent support, forever in shadow compared to  the brilliantly burning star that was the admired Etoile-sama of the 3  schools.</p>
<p>This, despite her relative proximity, both physically  (as they were roommates) and emotionally (as close friends) to Shizuma.  Miyuki knew a lot about Shizuma, but she felt that on some level, she  had never fully understood that sometimes enigmatic character that had  played such a crucial part in shaping who she grew up to be. Maybe it  was deliberate, an attempt to keep that same aura of mystery she had  sensed about that silver haired goddess when they first met, to  maintain the same excitement that had never really lessened from being  around her best friend and roommate. Yes, Rokujou Miyuki, stoic <em>seitokaichou</em> of St. Miatre, was not very much better than the legions of young,  wide-eyed admirers of the beautiful, untouchable Etoile-sama. She just  hid it a lot better, and constant, prolonged proximity to said Etoile  helped build up a certain immunity to the famed Hanazono charm that had  felled so many other younger girls. After all, constant exposure to a  virus increased immunity to the disease, and while Shizuma's charm  could hardly be called a disease, Miyuki privately felt that the number  of students afflicted by that same charm was alarmingly high, high  enough for it to be declared as an epidemic, should it ever be put that  way. However, it was not to be so, and almost the entire student  population was allowed to languish in helpless thrall to that beguiling  aura.</p>
<p>Her hand flew over the papers efficiently, going through  the stack with a mindless routine born of practiced habit. She was  after all, still the respected Student Council President of St. Miatre,  and such little things like paperwork were as much a part of her life  as eating and sleeping were. It was still difficult for her, on some  level, to reconcile her current image with that of the aching memory  that still resonated within her, that of a timid, homesick, crybaby who  exuded none of the control and confidence she now possessed. It had  been, predictably, Shizuma who had steered her onto this course of  excellence that she was currently on, although whether that was  intentional or not was still unknown to her. Though, if she knew her  friend well enough, she suspected Shizuma had never even considered the  fact that the reason Miyuki was even on the Student Council in the  first place was because the dark haired girl wanted to be useful to  Shizuma in the future. Not that she would admit it that openly to  Shizuma, the girl would never let her live it down.</p>
<p>All this  thinking was starting to make her head hurt, and it had nothing to do  with her current work on the reports or even the nature of the thoughts  which was in her mind. No, the source lay elsewhere. If only Tamao-san  and Nagisa-san had not approached her the day before to question her  about the persistent urban legend that still, somehow, lingered within  the hallowed halls of the Strawberry Dorms. A familiar defensive  irritation that came from hearing about the self-same rumor resurfaced  again, and her hand pressed down just a little more forcefully on the  innocent piece of paper before her. Having abandoned the weaker self of  her past, she now found it extremely annoying whenever reminded of it,  and did her utmost best to suppress the reality of that painful, if not  embarrassing, memory.</p>
<p><em>She could not sleep that first night,  whether it was excitement or discomfort at being a wholly new  environment, she could not pinpoint exactly. However, if the constant  barrage of fond memories of her home, which drew an achingly painful  sensation from within her heart was any indication, she was homesick.  Deeply, dreadfully so.</em></p>
<p><em>Unconsciously, she whimpered as she  curled up under the covers, trying to banish that terrible feeling of  loss and terror. The steady, even breathing of her roommate from across  on the other bed clearly indicated that the friendly, perfect Shizuma  was already asleep, showing no signs of the uneasiness that so plagued  her. Miyuki envied the other girl for her peaceful slumber, and wished  fervently that she could be taking the whole experience of being at a  boarding school as well as Shizuma did.</em></p>
<p><em>Amber eyes blinked  in the pervasive darkness, peering with a sort of fearful apprehension  at the still unfamiliar surroundings. Miyuki would never admit it, but  she still felt a certain childish fear of the dark, and now in this new  place, her old fears were quick to rear their ugly heads, and she  barely stifled a frightened sob. How she wished for the luminous safety  and warm comfort of her own room at home! That thought only served to  spark yet another wave of desperate yearning, and another choked sob  bubbled its way out from her throat.</em></p>
<p><em>Over on the other  bed, Shizuma shifted on the sheets, the faint rustling sound reminding  Miyuki that she was not alone in the room. Glancing over at the angelic  face peacefully in slumber, she fought down the sobs that were fighting  to escape from her.</em></p>
<p>'I can't wake Shizuma for this...she'll laugh at me for being silly...and I shouldn't disturb her..'<em> she thought even as the urge to cry grew stronger with every passing  minute. The voice of reason within her argued that Shizuma would never  laugh at her for this, as the golden-eyed girl had been nothing but  friendly to her throughout the day, and was one of the first few people  not to treat her like some silly little girl. Shizuma would understand,  argued that voice. </em></p>
<p><em>But pride and embarrassment won out,  and Miyuki made up her mind in that split second. Taking care not to  make any sound, she fled the room as quietly as she could, biting her  lip to control herself from breaking down into helpless tears before  she left. </em></p>
<p><em>The hallways were dark, and seemed almost to  stretch endlessly out in both directions. Not caring where she was  really going, only that she had to put some distance between herself  and the room, she wandered off in a randomly chosen direction, hugging  her arms to herself, her thin nightgown swishing around her ankles as  she moved. Her head was bowed, and she trembled slightly, partly from  the cold, but mostly from the surge of hot tears that threatened to  spill out of those luminous amber eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>The wind was  chilly, and the thin fabric of the nightgown did little to protect her  from the cutting breeze. However, she paid little heed to that minor  detail, her mind and heart too occupied with the overwhelming sense of  loneliness and longing that weighed down like a veritable mountain on  her young shoulders. Dimly, she realised that she should not be out  here so late at night, and that she would get into trouble if she were  caught. Good sense, if she still possessed any at this point, would  have dictated her return to the safety of her dorm room, but she was  definitely not in the right frame of mind at the moment. Instead, the  vague worry that she could have been caught translated to a need to  find a hidden place to cry in peace within her muddled mind.</em></p>
<p><em>Arriving  at a junction, Miyuki looked around uncertainly, her now red-rimmed  eyes scanning her surroundings. If memory served from the orientation  tour they received earlier, she was currently at the border between  Spica and Miatre, and she definitely didn't want to go down a  completely unfamiliar route this late at night. Standing alone and  barefooted in the chilly hallway, she was once again struck by how the  vastness of the dorms made her shrink on the inside, and a fresh  torrent of tears trailed down her cherubic face. </em></p>
<p><em>Unthinkingly,  partly to get out of the direct assault from the cold breeze, she  huddled down in a somewhat hidden corner, taking cover behind a potted  plant and in between the angle of the walls, rendering her more or less  unseen by any undiscerning passerby. The act of crouching down made her  feel even smaller and even more helpless, and she couldn't help herself  from sobbing some more. She was miserable from being so far and alone  away from home, and even more miserable that she couldn't even be a  little more grown up and brave about it. The imagined disappointment of  her parents at her current behaviour only caused a fresh deluge to  spill from her eyes, and her shoulders shook with every pained sob her  little throat emitted. She wanted so desperately to go home, into her  mother's warm embrace, but she did want to make her parents proud of  her by staying at a prestigious school like St. Miatre. The conflict in  emotions served only to spur more helpless tears from the fragile  little girl, so very vulnerable in her plain white nightgown.</em></p>
<p><em>She  did not know how long she stayed there, but after some time, the tears  dried up, and she was dimly aware that she really should return before  daybreak, lest Shizuma be worried when she woke up. Solemnly she wiped  off the last traces of tears from her face, and quickly made her way  back, that aching longing for home within her never abating even as she  started towards her room.</em></p>
<p>Miyuki knew now that Shizuma had  known from the start when she first left the room, the latter being a  relatively light sleeper and had been awakened by the click of the door  opening and closing. Why Shizuma had not immediately confronted her  upon her return she did not know then, but on hindsight, she knew that  they were still only just on their first day of their acquaintance,  barely enough to establish any kind of relationship, much less the  solid friendship that was the cornerstone of her life now. Shizuma must  have been uncertain on how exactly to approach her without  inadvertently giving offense. Miyuki sighed as she set aside yet  another form onto the stack marked 'completed', and reached for another  document almost mechanically as she continued to reminiscise.</p>
<p><em>It  had been almost a whole week into the school term, and Miyuki was  slowly getting used to the routine at the academy. More importantly,  she was growing closer to Shizuma, and tended to follow around behind  her like a second shadow...or a puppy. Shizuma was unfailingly kind and  patient with her, yet without ever coming across as condescending in  any shape or form. Miyuki grew to trust her silver haired roommate cum  best friend, her somewhat retiring nature automatically clinging on to  the pillar of strength that was Hanazono Shizuma. It was comforting to  have someone to rely on in an unfamiliar place.</em></p>
<p><em>However,  she still found it difficult to confide in her golden eyed guardian  angel, her reserved nature and upbringing an obstacle in revealing the  more vulnerable side of herself. She still snuck out of their room (she  had come to think of the room as 'theirs' now) ever so often to cry out  her inherent homesickness in that isolated corner she had found in that  first night. Shizuma never said anything if she knew, and Miyuki never  detected any signs of Shizuma knowing about her midnight excursions, so  the issue was more or less swept under the carpet.</em></p>
<p><em>What Miyuki had certainly not anticipated, however, was that someone </em>else<em> had heard her sobs in the hallway at night, and this being a girls'  school, the story spread like wildfire, as it dribbled down with  surprising speed through the gossip express, growing wilder with each  retelling. At first though, the rumor had been spreading within  St.Spica initially, so Miyuki was unaware that her nightly shennigans  was currently the horror story of choice among the fervent gossipers. </em></p>
<p>Well,  that didn't last long, Miyuki thought as she signed off yet another  form, and eyed the still tall pile with some resentment. If there was  one thing she despised the most about her position, it was the  paperwork. The other major gripe was probably the alienating effect it  had on her person; everyone and their dog referred to her as  Rokujou-sama or somewhere along those lines. The only person who did  call her by name was Shizuma, and for that she was grateful, because  she privately suspected that without Shizuma referring to her as such,  she would have forgotten her own name by the time she graduated.  Distressingly enough, she thought with some consternation, she  sometimes thought of herself in her mind as 'Rokujou' and not 'Miyuki'.  Since when did her family name take over her entire person? She decided  not to go down that road, it was too disturbing to admit to herself  that she might have been too absorbed in her position as Rokujou-sama  the President of the Miatre Student Council, to the point of discarding  her identity as Rokujou Miyuki the seventeen year old girl.</p>
<p>In an  effort to distract herself from the monotony of the onerous paperwork,  she put the quill down and got up from her seat, walking over to peer  out of the window at the glowing sunset in the horizon. It was getting  late, and she still had so much more to do. A familiar prick of  irritation came to her as she recalled that Shizuma was responsible for  looking over at least half of that monstrous stack of papers currently  lying on the desk. But then she shrugged. She was used to that aspect  of her erstwhile roommate, and even more used to picking up the pieces  after her, be it in their work or in her life.</p>
<p>Still, it was  somewhat ironic that right at first, Miyuki had needed Shizuma's help  to get over her own issues. Inadvertently, her mind was drawn towards  the past, or at least, the part of the past that was happy for  her...happy for both of them actually.</p>
<p><em>It was becoming a  habit, almost. Only a very bad one. One whole week of crying in the  hallways at night probably wasn't conducive to maintaining a state of  good health. Miyuki knew that intellectually, but with every nightfall,  she found herself drawn away from her bed as the sick feeling of unease  came to her once again. </em></p>
<p><em>So it was, on the eighth night,  when she was carefully climbing out of bed and sneaking towards the  door, something happened to disturb her usual routine.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Miyuki...?&quot;  A familiar voice, blurred with sleep, called from behind her. She froze  in her tracks as Shizuma stirred behind her, the bedsheets rustling as  the other girl moved. &quot;Come back to bed...&quot; came the faint murmur. </em></p>
<p><em>Miyuki,  being at the foot of Shizuma's bed, briefly assessed the situation.  Shizuma appeared to be nodding off again, and she could probably sneak  off after her roommate had completely fallen asleep again. Otherwise,  she could just go back to bed and wait the other girl out before  attempting to sneak out again. She was still pondering her options when  a firm grip snaked around her wrist and hauled her backwards and  angling sideways, causing her to fall quite unceremoniously into  Shizuma's bed. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Nnnn...Miyuki no baka...&quot; Said girl  twitched as Shizuma promptly managed to enfold her in a bear hug,  effectively trapping her within a warm embrace. Not that she didn't try  to free herself---wriggling didn't seem to work, and Shizuma had  apparently gone straight back to sleep while clinging on to her like an  oversized teddy bear. </em></p>
<p>'Well, now what?'<em> Miyuki thought  to herself as she tried valiantly to escape Shizuma's iron grip, but to  no avail. The silver haired girl had latched on to her so tightly that,  short of using violent physical force to separate herself, she would  never get away, as the sleeping girl seemed unwilling to relinquish her  tight hold.</em></p>
<p><em>Giving up on escaping for that night, Miyuki  tried to get into a more comfortable position, which was slightly  challenging, due to the fact that well, Shizuma had her face  practically squashed against her chest, and it felt oddly...safe?  Miyuki blinked into Shizuma's nightshirt in front of her as she allowed  herself to relax. It was warm, and strangely comforting, to be caught  up in a protective embrace by her roommate. The uneasy feeling that had  plagued her for the past week faded into the background, and the  fatigue of the past week finally caught up with her.</em></p>
<p><em>Her  eyelashes fluttered as her eyelids slid close, and she unconsciously  snuggled closer into Shizuma's embrace. Eventually, her breathing  evened out and for the first time in a week, Rokujou Miyuki got some  proper, undisturbed sleep.</em></p>
<p>Smiling almost unconsciously, the  now much older Miyuki now remembered how safe it felt to be in  Shizuma's arms. With an almost inaudible sigh, she turned and returned  to the waiting pile of paperwork. Thinking about such things wouldn't  get her work done any sooner, and Shizuma was unlikely to ever hold her  that way anymore anyway. She could only content herself with these  memories of the past, of happier times together.</p>
<p>Time seemed  meaningless as Rokujou Miyuki settled back into the familiar work  routine. Take paper, skim through contents, sign approval, put paper in  separate pile. Repeat. It was almost as if her body was working on  autopilot.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way her mind wandered again, which  wasn't surprising, since it wasn't particularly occupied with the work  in front of her, at least not all that much.</p>
<p><em>Sleeping in the  same bed with Shizuma definitely helped, and Shizuma didn't seem to  mind all that much. The first time they woke up together in the same  bed, Shizuma had turned on that infectious grin of hers and remarked  about how hugging Miyuki was more comfortable than hugging a teddy  bear, which made said 'teddy bear' flush in embarrassment. </em></p>
<p><em>Despite  the occasional teasing that day, Miyuki had found herself next to  Shizuma's bed that night again, and her roommate said nothing, choosing  instead to pull her back down with her on the bed. It became routine  for the next few nights for Miyuki to sleep with Shizuma, although the  playful teasing she got from the silver haired girl was more than made  up for by the uninterrupted sleep she received at night. </em></p>
<p><em>The  issue of her crying was never brought up after that...at least not  until the next time she started it again. That was after she received a  letter from home, which triggered more emotions than Miyuki thought  that it would. Before she even knew it, Miyuki found herself back in  the same old hallway, sobbing piiteously as the homesickness came by to  visit again. </em></p>
<p><em>Shizuma had come for her then, for the  first time, thus dropping the pretended ignorance of her crying. The  warmth from the hand that had taken hers in a reassuring grasp as they  walked back to their room was a memory she would take into future  years, whenever the going got tough. Because Shizuma came for her, and  for that she would perservere...no matter what the silver haired girl  did to tease her.</em></p>
<p>A fond smile tugged at the corners of  Miyuki's mouth almost involuntarily as she recalled the scene, a smile  that half-faded as she remembered that that was also the last night she  slept with Shizuma in the same bed. It hurt almost as much as a  physical blow to compare the lively, energetic girl she knew from  before to the detached, vampire-like individual now that masqueraded as  her best friend and roommate.</p>
<p>Shizuma teased her far less often  now, that vivacious personality of hers having receded far back into  the shell of a person she was now, a result of a painful event in the  past. Oddly, Miyuki found that she missed the teasing to some extent,  it used to be a staple in her daily life; practically a day would not  pass without Shizuma making a joke at her expense. Despite the marked  lack of obvious verbal ribbing from her best friend, Miyuki noted that  Shizuma was unfortunately still able to make her feel uncomfortable,  embarrassed and inadequate, all at the same time.</p>
<p>She had to look  no further than the earlier in the day, when she had somehow managed to  drift off in lessons, and had not Shizuma stepped in to bail her out of  a potentially awkward situation, she would most likely have had been  reprimanded by the teacher. Hardly behaviour fitting for the revered  Rokujou-kaichou, and Miyuki knew it. And Shizuma's words after that  definitely didn't help to improve her mood. <em>Work harder</em>? The  nerve of that woman to even suggest it! Were Miyuki of lesser breeding,  she would have turned around and throttled the smugly smiling Etoile  right there and then. Work harder indeed! Miyuki let her eyelids  flutter close for a moment, her grip on the quill tightening briefly.  It almost seemed to her that no matter how hard she did work, it would  never be enough.</p>
<p>Still, she should not have been daydreaming  about the past during lessons. Even if it was an immensely boring one  on European history. Not for the first time that day, Miyuki cursed her  lapse in self-control. She was more disciplined than that, surely. Why  did she have to think about that part of her past there and then  anyway? It didn't matter anymore!</p>
<p>Her eyes still closed, she  shook her head at her own denial. No, it mattered, more than ever. It  was the reason she was on the Student Council, the reason she acted the  way she did, the reason she was the person she was. It was a promise  she made, and a promise she was still working towards.</p>
<p><em>I''ll work hard. And one day, I'll be as strong as Shizuma is.</em></p>
<p>x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x</p>
<p>Footsteps  padded softly on soft carpet, halting in front of the thin shaft of  light emanating from a crack in the doors. A soft hand reached out to  nudge the door open, moving inwards into the room and its sole occupant.</p>
<p>The  intruder gazed calmly at the figure currently dozing with her head  resting on the tabletop, dark blue hair obscuring part of her  slumbering face. One hand still loosely grasped a feather quill, its  point lightly bobbing against the sheet of paper the sleeping girl was  resting on. The watcher chuckled softly at the sight, almost tempted to  just stand there and watch her friend sleep, but thought better of the  notion and moved towards the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Miyuki, Miyuki...&quot; She had  to be dreaming again, Miyuki decided. Why else would she suddenly hear  Shizuma's voice calling out to her the same way it did 6 years ago in a  drafty hallway anyway? The voice grew more insistent, and someone  appeared to be shaking her shoulder. Amber eyes blinked blearily as the  last vestiges of sleep stubbornly clung on to her slender frame, but  was more or less awake...enough to notice familiar silver locks  somewhere off to one side.</p>
<p>&quot;Shizuma?&quot; Miyuki barely suppressed a  yawn as she lifted her head off the table, wincing as the crick in her  neck made itself painfully known. She didn't have to look up to know  that Shizuma was probably smiling knowingly...again. Idly, the student  council president wondered just how well her friend knew her and her  motivations...probably more than she herself would like to admit.</p>
<p>&quot;When  I said to work hard, I didn't mean 'work until you drop',&quot; the Etoile  remarked diffidently as she moved to take a position behind the  stubborn council president. Miyuki was about to open her mouth in  protest; instead her indignance came out in a barely suppressed purr of  satisfaction as firm hands kneaded her shoulders, relieving the tension  that had built up in the muscles there.</p>
<p>Sighing defeatedly, Miyuki let her eyelids droop close again. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>Pausing  in her ministrations, Shizuma leant down and firmly removed the quill  from Miyuki's hand, before proceeding to haul the sleepy Rokujou-sama  out of her seat and ushering her out of the council room. Miyuki made a  few noises of protest, all of which were soundly ignored. Not that the  bluenette was really in any condition to put up much of a fight, since  she was practically dead on her feet after working continuously without  pause for so many hours.</p>
<p>As she was being marched off back to her  room by the somewhat pushy Etoile, Miyuki murmured the question that  had been plaguing her since she woke from her unscheduled nap.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did you come to get me? And how did you know I'd be there anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>There was a poignant pause, then a light chuckle. Shizuma's voice was heavy with ironic amusement as she answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Where  else would you be?&quot; Another pause. &quot;Since I think you've already  outgrown the hallway, at any rate.&quot; A satisfied smirk adorned that  beautful face.</p>
<p>The slight flush on Miyuki's cheeks was most  likely a combination of irritation and embarrassment. &quot;Shizuma!&quot; A  throaty laugh greeted her indignant retort.</p>
<p>They moved on back  down the hallway leading up to their room in relative silence for the  next few moments. Until Shizuma spoke up again.</p>
<p>&quot;I happened to be walking around.&quot; Miyuki turned bleary eyes onto her companion. &quot;Eh?&quot;</p>
<p>A  half smile. &quot;I reserve the right to roam around at night.&quot; A pregnant  pause. &quot;You never stay out that late usually, and I was...worried.&quot;</p>
<p>Miyuki blinked, her sleepy mind suddenly clearing in an instant. &quot;You were?&quot;</p>
<p>Shizuma  smirked. &quot;Well, if something happened to you, who would boss me around  the way you do? I'd miss your nagging if you weren't around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shizuma!&quot;  This was a standard feature in their interactions, and Miyuki was  slightly startled to find how easily they could slip back into the  familiar routine at times. Of late, it seemed that Shizuma was  beginning to show fleeting signs of her old self, and those little  flashes of the past ignited a faint hope in the stoic Rokujou-kaichou.  It seemed almost possible to get her old friend back the way she used  to be, and the very idea of it warmed her heart.</p>
<p>Something else  occured to her, even as Shizuma guided her weary form into their room,  making sure that she undressed for bed before switching off the lights.  As she lay in her bed, an old, familiar thought burned softly in her  heart, warming her very soul.</p>
<p><em>Shizuma came for me...again.</em></p>
<p>And  suddenly, working hard and persevering wasn't so very difficult after  all. She could do this; it was the least she could do for herself, and  for <em>her</em>.</p>
<p>Miyuki smiled softly in the dark, satisfied, before falling once again into Morpheus' embrace.</p>

<p>Ok,  so that's it. Whew. It took a whole lot longer to write than I first  thought! I had to keep making changes when I discovered discrepancies  as I wrote. And finding the right setting and time for this to work was  a bit more challenging than I first thought. Oh well. In case it wasn't  clear enough though, this is set later in the day after the scene where  Miyuki dozes off in class and Shizuma had to drop hints for her.</p>
<p>Personally,  I wrote this mainly because I had a soft spot for Miyuki, and I just  couldn't get over the sheer kawaii-ness that was their chibi selves. I  came up with this after watching episode 9, but I finished this only  after episode 19 came out. Lol. Episodes 18 and 19 completely messed  with my characterisation, so I had to go back to rewrite, hence the  long wait. I had to add in a few more ideas after episode 20 came out  though, which resulted in MORE tweaking. Honestly. This anime starts  dropping twists into the plot this late into the show! Oh well, it  makes for more fun to watch.</p>
<p>Now, to get on to my next Miyuki-centered fic. Yes I adore Miyuki. And why not? XD</p>
