<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Well, if  Momomi was to characterise my reviews with one of her english idioms,  it'd be &quot;it never rains but it pours&quot;. Thanks for all the support! And  don't worry, I'm determined to see this fic through to the end.</span></p>
</span>

Kaname sighed as she walked the streets at random, a reproachful Momomi hot on her heels.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Did you have to make a scene?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  didn’t make a scene!” Kaname snapped. “You should have let me pay for  my half, then there wouldn’t have been any need to make a scene!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “Why can’t you just let me be generous? It’s not like I don’t have money to burn right now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you. Even if you call me an idiot, I have my pride. That won’t change, not even for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Isn’t  it more sensible to mooch off other people?” Momomi snorted. “Hell, you  told me yourself, you wouldn’t hesitate to spend my father’s money, in  my position. Well, now you have a chance to spend my father’s money in  yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is different. It’s yours, and you are my equal. I don’t intend to owe you anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  told you, I’m the one who owes you, as your doing me a favour!” Momomi  folded her arms, annoyed. “It’s not like the money matters to me  anyway. We’re equals regardless of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m not as well-placed as you to say that money doesn’t matter, now am I? It’s a damn annoying attitude…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Gah!  The only one who’s making this affect our relationship is you, you  know! Even though it’s important, you’re the one who values their pride  even more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not something you’d understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Give it  up, already! That’s something my father would say to casually dismiss  my words, so I won’t let you say anything like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “Persistent, aren’t you? Can’t you just give up for my sake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m persisting for your sake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, no one asked you to!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  sighed. “Now who’s being persistent? I’ll tell you what… I swear blind,  for every yen you spend today I’ll burn three. You won’t accept it and  I don’t want it, I don’t want anything touched by that bastard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I said before, you’re the only one who can afford to make those gestures!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re the one with freedom. Once I’ve passed the scholarship exam, I’m going to be just like you. And that’s what I want.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More fool you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, your father was no saint either. Would you accept money from him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What other choice would I have?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You could do what you’re doing right now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I didn’t choose to live this way, and I don’t recommend it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m choosing that path, and I don’t care what you recommend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now who’s the prideful one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No,  you’re the one who doesn’t understand!” Momomi pouted furiously. “I’ve  spent my whole life being controlled by that bastard! Even now, I’m  here because of his whim! Past, present, and even my future, he wants  to own them all. At least your parents let you be independent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Want to swap places? Freedom is overrated, I can assure you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Fine  by me! I’m not going to spent the rest of my life as a business asset  to be developed, managed and sold off at his leisure!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And I don’t intend to spend my life in grinding poverty, either!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You can say that yourself, but if I said that, you’d be furious!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname’s eyes flashed. “Well, of course! You don’t have any right to say that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No  right? You never ask for permission, Kaname, and neither do I.” Momomi  stopped and put her hands on her hips. “So I’ll say it! You’re poor and  I’m rich! Get the hell over it, it’s not like I give a damn!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  snarled and turned to slap her, but something in her fierce but  trembling expression checked her slightly. Somehow Momomi grabbed her  hand, protecting her face. “Take that back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why would I? You’re  being stupid!” Momomi looked like she was close to tears, but she  pressed on. “If I have to say it, I will. That’s just the way it is!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  very bloody easy for you to say that, now isn’t it?” Kaname resisted  the impulse to strike the girl again. “It’s not so easy for me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I’m sick of you pretending to the victim! You’re nobody’s victim, so  it’s just too stupid to watch. You’re strong enough to lap me, smart  enough to border on genius level and determined enough to attend our  school!” Momomi glared at her. “Something like money’s nothing, because  you’re going to come out of life a winner anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, well,  there are some doors that not even my abilities can open,” Kaname  retorted. “But they’re wide open for you. Don’t be too naïve!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  intend to cut off those ties as well! I’m not a rich lady you can  stereotype freely. I’ll stand on my own feet, even if you call me  stupid. Because my pride is important as well!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Your pride is goddamn stupid! If you’re born with a silver spoon use it to eat the cake!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re just the same! If someone born with a silver spoon is offering you some cake, it’s even more stupid not to eat it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why should I do that?” Kaname folded her arms and brought herself up to her full height. “I can find my own cake!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  stared at her for a few moments, then fought to keep a straight face.  “This is what happens when you take a metaphor so far…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you laughing at?” Kaname demanded, thrown a little off-balance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You said that way too dramatically. Shall we go and look for a cake shop, Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Stop teasing me, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi stopped giggling. “Alright, alright… though it’s funny. But seriously, what do I have to do before you’ll accept a gift?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s some gift you’re offering…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Please? I want to enjoy today with you, without worries. Can’t you let me be feckless for once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  felt the rest of her anger fade at the sight of her friend’s relatively  contrite face. “You make that sound reasonable, but I told you. I have-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“My  pride,” Momomi completed, making a face. “Normally, I find that cute.  But can’t you let yourself go just once? It makes me feel like you  don’t trust me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s precisely because your opinion is important that I’m being so persistent, you know,” Kaname retorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I’m flattered. Now accept my generosity!” Momomi gave her a cunning  look. “You know, with an attitude you’d annoy a load of guys. Why can’t  you let someone feel like they’re treating you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t let people patronise me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “Perish the thought… just this once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll stop whining then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I said no.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, would it make you feel better if I gave you a job to do in return?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Like what?” Kaname asked warily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smirked. “I’ll hire you, and you’ll have to do everything I tell you to do all day. How about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Drop dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, come on. Isn’t that fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname decided she had to take this threat seriously. <em>Let her have her way and I could be royally screwed. </em>“No way. You’ll make me suffer terribly, and then pretend that you paying for it is somehow compensation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, come on. I’ll pay extra!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I could care less about money. I have my pride, still, you know. It hasn’t gone away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi gave her another evil look. “Hmm… if that’s the case I’ll just have to use it against you, now won’t I? How about a bet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A bet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Right,  a bet.” Momomi grinned enthusiastically. “How about these terms? If I  win, I’ll get to pay for everything and you take my orders all day. If  you win, you get to boss me around and you also get all my money. How  about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you, I don’t need your-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And perhaps  the loser has to refer to the winner as sama, or something. Onisama?”  She giggled at the thought. “That would be hilarious…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t get too ahead of yourself. I haven’t agreed to anything yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname’s  a spoilsport, just like usual.” Momomi tapped her lip thoughtfully.  “Now I just need to decide on a good bet. How about on what Olesa’s  doing right now? We can confirm it by phone, if we press them enough. I  vote Starcraft.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do you think I’m going to bet against that,  after what you told me about her?” Kaname snorted. “I’m not going  against a certainty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“On Shion, perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Watching a cop drama. You told me that too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm,  I’m inclined to say stalking someone, actually. Probably going  tap-tap-tap with her keyboard and researching the details of some poor  sod’s innermost life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned. “So we can have a bet on that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you asking?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  cocked her head, weighing it up in her head. “Let’s see… well, there’s  a rule of gambling. That’s to say, never take a bet where the loss is  infinite. That’s just silly. And to all intents and purposes, being  your bit… servant for a day is an infinite loss. It’s not a bet any  sensible person would take.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted. “No? You’re no fun after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“On  the other hand, having you take my orders is way too funny, and I’m not  a sensible person.” Kaname shrugged. “At least this way we’ll resolve  the issue, one way or the other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so,” Momomi admitted. She pulled out her phone. “Now all that’s left is to confirm the data.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Give me that!” Kaname snatched the mobile. “I don’t trust you, so I’ll do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What if I don’t trust you? Shouldn’t we find a neutral third party?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That would just be stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This whole thing is stupid, isn’t it? Come on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  told you, I don’t ask for help from strangers. Least of all for this,  it would take an awful lot of explaining, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  argument won, Kaname rang Shion’s number. She didn’t pick up for quite  some time, to her annoyance. She was about ready to give up when the  stalker senpai finally answered. <em>“Hello. I can’t speak, right now. I’m on the phone.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Of course, you’re on the phone, you’re speaking to me. What kind of sense does that make?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>Oh, Kenjou-kun?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do you have to call me that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>Kaname-chi, then,”</em> Shion quipped, managing to smirk with sound alone. <em>“But I really can’t talk right now.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Busy with the Literature Club?” Kaname enquired sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>Oh, dear. It looks like my cover’s blown. No, not exactly. I’m in the middle of a long-distance phone call to Isae-chan.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>Don’t sound too surprised,”</em> Shion said reproachfully. <em>“I said I would do it.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But you’re not doing anything while you’re doing it, are you? Like watching something or-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>Isae requires my full attention. Which is why I’m about to hang up. I’ve no idea why you called anyway.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Wait-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion hung up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well?” Momomi demanded expectantly. “You sounded a little surprised, you know. Do I win?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hardly. She said she was on the phone to Isae.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’s what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s what I just said!” Kaname tossed the phone back. “Surprising, I know, but it looks like we both got unlucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “I really should be glad for her, but it’s hard not to feel disappointed. Another bet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I choose this time. The Etoiles?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Honeymooning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Post Araldo, you mean?” Kaname winced. “Yeah, I guess there isn’t much of a bet to be had there, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  I was of a suspicious frame of mind, I’d also wonder whether Serané  intended to get her two favourite problem children out from under her  feet for a day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname considered this. “She may act innocent but she’s just cunning enough that I could believe that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shall we bet on that, instead?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She wouldn’t admit it to our faces, forget over the phone,” Kaname pointed out. “Besides, I’d hate to interrupt anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm… you’re as dirty-minded as ever, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What’s  dirty-minded about that?” Kaname demanded, flustered. “I mean a  romantic day in, or whatever they do. It’s eleven in the morning!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shall we bet on what they’re doing in that sense?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Like I want to know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, they probably wouldn’t pick up anyway.” Momomi sighed. “We appear to be at an impasse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. <em>Ironically, for two stubborn, haughty and proud people, this really is the best way to resolve the situation. </em>“Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’d be in lessons. Besides, we don’t know her number.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Araldo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Being chewed out by dad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Luigia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Defending Araldo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yukaho?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Wringing her hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“My mother?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shouting at… hey, wait, how the hell should I know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Helping  someone knee-deep in legally ambiguous activity with the paper-work,”  Kaname said. “But never mind. We appear to know very predictable  people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it doesn’t help that most of them are in class,  does it? Those are the ones who are where they’re supposed to be. And  our parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Amiki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What kind of question is that? Playing Starcraft with Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah, but co-op or verses?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi cocked her head. “Can you imagine her going against Olesa in anything? She’d probably let herself lose every time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Verses  is better training. Olesa might insist on it, and insist that Amiki go  all out.” Kaname scratched her nose. “If I’ve read her character right,  she’d do that if instructed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I suppose,” Momomi conceded. “But then there’s the third option, which is Olesa playing a 1v1 while Amiki watches.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you put it like that, couldn’t it be the other way round as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  wouldn’t judge it likely. But either way, this isn’t like the bet on  Shion, there’s four more and less likely possibilities. I’m voting…  co-op. It just seems so very them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How about the Campaign mode? They could be playing that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  snorted. “Someone like Olesa, a perfectionist, would definitely have  exhausted that a long time ago. Shion was clear that it was online  play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She might be trying to complete each mission as fast as  possible,” Kaname said defensively. “Really anal people do that stuff,  self-set challenges.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi threw up her hands. “Well, if you want to bet that, bet that. Just go for something!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname closed her eyes, considering. “Well, knowing them… I’m going with 1vs1, Amiki watching.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi took out her phone. “Right. Let’s find out, shall we? I’ll phone this time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname clicked her fingers. “Wait!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  looked at her. “What? Don’t tell me you’re using the phone again,  because you did that last time. And you didn’t make a very good job of  it, then, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I have an even better idea of how to settle this,” Kaname said seriously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi quirked her eyebrows. “What’s that, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname drew herself up. “Janken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Janken… you mean rock-paper-scissors?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’ll settle things, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “I suppose so, but it lacks a certain <em>je ne sais quois</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A certain what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s lame! It’s really lame! That’s what I’m trying to say!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  sniffed. “Well, at least it’s quick, painless, and decisive. The whole  thing with Olesa and Amiki is far less likely to produce a decisive  winner, and then what will we do. Play rock-paper-scissors anyway? Flip  a coin? Isn’t it easier to just do that now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “You have no sense of drama, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps  not, but I have a very acute sense of we’re standing out here in the  street and my legs are getting tired and this is stupid. If you know  what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright. Alright. I take your point. Fine, let’s just get this over with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They faced each other, eyes narrowed and hands held ready. Kaname bit her lip. “The same stakes as before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The same stakes as before,” Momomi agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>This is one heck of a game of Janken. </em>Kaname dismissed the thought, along with anything else concerning how high the stakes were. <em>That  will only distract me now, I have to concentrate, and use every second  of thought available to me. If it came down to attributes, Momomi would  be scissors for her cutting words, and I’m rock for my apathetic  resilience. That’d be to my advantage. But Momomi also has a paper-like  quality, because she embraces me and all around her with her emotions,  she’s a complex person. Wait, what does this have to do with anything?  Somehow, rock feels like the default move to me. Which makes paper the  natural counter-move, but she…feels, like a scissors person, somehow. I  can imagine that being a move she’d make more often than not if this  became a long match. So do I stick to rock? But doesn’t that feel like  my standard move in turn? Surely she’s thought of something so simple  as that…in which case, I should play scissors, anticipating paper. Or  could it be a double bluff? Momomi’s more than smart enough to  formulate such a strategy…or could it be a triple bluff, and she just  wants me to think that? Someone as capable at manipulation as her could  make any move. No, so think about probabilities. If I play scissors I  can match what I’m sure is her default move and defeat her if she goes  paper. Rock just doesn’t feel like a Momomi move. But what if she  exploits my sentimentality and does play rock? There are too many  variables to consider, damnit! How about if-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shall we play?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname gritted her teeth. <em>Damn  her, she’s forced her hand before I’m ready to make a move. Has she  already made her own calculations? Am I about to walk into a trap?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t look so constipated, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What? I thought you were supposed to be the polite one…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Come on, let’s just get this other with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname raised her hand to match her friend’s. “You know how to play Japanese-style, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. What difference does it make, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The gods of probability will definitely favour the native,” Kaname said, rather more confidently than she felt. <em>It’s getting harder not to think about the stakes…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Whatever.” Momomi began to move her hand. “Starting with the stone!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  imitated the cry, closed her eyes, and played scissors. She opened her  eyes, and found that Momomi had done the same. She smiled slightly. <em>So, my prediction was correct, scissors really is her natural move… if only I’d trusted my instincts and gone rock…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Isn’t that a tie!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname winced, closed her eyes, and chose paper at random. <em>I didn’t have time to calculate this far ahead!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I win.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname opened her eyes and saw that Momomi had played scissors again. “Impossible… how did you know what to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked puzzled. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How did you know exactly which move to play even without enough thinking time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What? I just picked at random. Isn’t that the point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re lying,” Kaname said. “I would never lose that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname, it’s rock-paper-scissors, not shogi. It’s all about luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No great general ever relied on luck! Did Napoleon ever rely on luck?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“He  would have to, if he ever played rock-paper-scissors with Wellington.”  Momomi grinned. “Besides, he lost anyway. He’s a bad role model in that  respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even so, when he lost, it wasn’t a matter of luck,” Kaname snapped. “And he’d have strategized if he’d ever played Janken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Plainly  it’s a bad idea, as the one who did that lost.” Momomi giggled. “You  mean you were really trying to work it all out in your head?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. You were really picking at random?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They stared at each other in mutual incomprehension.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Then Momomi shrugged and grinned. “Well, I won.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Best of three! We agreed on best of three, didn’t we?” Kaname gabbled. “I definitely remember that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  just shook her head and took Kaname’s hand. “You lose, you lose, you  lose. Now lose gratefully and obey my every whim for the rest of the  day!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Damnit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi dragged her away. “Now, first things first! We’re going clothes shopping, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t have any right to resist, do I?” <em>Her hand is warm.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  right,” Momomi nodded. “And you’re carrying all the bags, too. And when  I pick stuff out, you’ll have to try everything on and show it to me,  one at a time. Okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So I’m your doll, basically?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Pretty  much. I’m just sad I don’t have any ribbons on me.” Momomi smiled at  her. “Oh, come on. Don’t make that face. It’ll be fun! I’m sure you’ll  get the hang of it in no time! A handsome girl like you should  definitely enjoy playing dress-up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>It’s small and warm and  very soft and delicate. I guess I should expect that of her. And it  feels completely different from my hands, though I can’t really feel  them very well myself. I wonder what she thinks about my hands…they’re  probably big and rough and hard. That’s a lot more practical, I was  always proud of them before, but now, for some reason-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oi,  don’t space out on me!” Momomi waved at her. “Come on, Kaname, you’re  making me feel cruel. Off to your happy place at the first sign of my  fun and games? It’s a little discouraging.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, that’s not it,” Kaname said. “I was just…thinking. About stuff.”<em> I’m not quite sure why I’m defending pastimes I don’t want to go on. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted at her. “Like what? I’m annoyed if it’s more important than what I’m saying to you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, not at all… I was just thinking-” <em>about how soft your hand is- hell no! </em>“about…  Olesa and Amiki. Now that we talked about it so much, I can’t help but  wonder,” Kaname managed, smiling in a slightly strangled way. <em>The truth would be misinterpreted, after all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“God, you mean you’re still worried about that?” Momomi snorted. “You were the one who suggested settling it with Janken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">A flash of hope occurred to her. “Well, I’ve been thinking about that, and you were right, it wasn’t-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re  not retaking the bet based on the result of the call,” Momomi said  sternly. “You lost, now be quiet and accept it already! Jeez…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Wait,  is there anything to misinterpret? If I’m so conscious of her hand,  doesn’t that suggest something? Why is she holding it anyway? Can’t she  drag me by the wrist? Hell, can’t she let me walk myself? But I can let  go any time I want, we both know that…but I don’t want to. That doesn’t  matter, though. I’d probably surprise and upset her if I did that, and  I don’t want that, because this is her celebration and she’s currently  giving me orders anyway. So it’s right for me to stay like this if  that’s what she wants. Definitely. Why startle her? But if I do stay  like this, aren’t I suggesting… no, it’s nothing like that. Friends  hold hands. I’m just being twitchy. It’s probably my hobophobia  speaking… hobophobia? Homophobia! Either way, it makes me overly  conscious of these things, and I don’t know the bounds of a  relationship anyway, so it’s natural that I’d overreact from time to  time! </em>She frowned. <em>Yeah, I don’t know the bounds of a  relationship… either way. What do I know about when friendship stops?  And when you think about us- </em>she shook her head to clear it of the unpleasant, disconcerting thoughts that she didn’t want to have. <em>It’s  nothing like that. Momomi has never said anything like that, right?  It’d only upset her if she thought I suspected her like that, and it’s  my fault because I’m being ultra-paranoid. So I should just forget all  about it. But why does that feel like running away? More importantly,  should I really still be holding her hand?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s well over thirty seconds in your happy place,” Momomi teased, prodding her in the chest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname blinked out of her trance, looking down at her friend. “Sorry. I was just-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thinking,”  Momomi completed. “Well, it’s fine.” She gave Kaname a strange look,  all the same. “This is the first place I want to go into, anyway. Let’s  go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi released her hand, to her intense relief, and walked  into the store, Kaname following close behind. “I wish you wouldn’t  call it that, you know,” she chided. “It makes me sound crazy or stupid  or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m only teasing you. Besides, what else am I supposed to call it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t know, but… something not that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  turned and smiled warmly at her. “Don’t take me that seriously, okay? I  was just teasing you. I know we both like to think things through at  times, it’s something we can both do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To hide our inner thoughts?” Kaname mused, considering this. <em>It’s true, I guess. For me and her both.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And to work out what to say next, to lead you this way or that.” Momomi smiled again. “I’m the manipulative one, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Deceptive girl.” But Kaname couldn’t stop herself from smiling back. <em>She  looks so…happy, today. Our earlier argument’s completely forgotten, and  even though I lost, I’m still glad. It pains me when she’s sad, which  isn’t something I’d care to admit to her face.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Less  deceptive than I’d like,” Momomi noted. “More deceptive than other  people would like. I guess it’s the same for everyone, no one can quite  match their ideals in practise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You know, I was just thinking the same thing myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Really?” Momomi gave her a sly look. “About what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, nothing much…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tell me, tell me! I order you to tell me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  looked at her enthusiastic face, and decided to give into that rather  than any bet. “I’m less emotionless than I’d like, but more than other  people would like, I think. Just the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just the same,” Momomi agreed. She looked around briskly. “Well, no point in brooding on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  quickly found the girls' wear section. She didn’t squeal, but all the  same, her enthusiasm made it feel like she had. Kaname followed more  slowly, looking around with a jaded eye. <em>Actually, women’s clothing  is over-represented here, especially in the teenage-girl age bracket. I  guess Astraea above really bends this town out of shape.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  was already rooting through the shelves. “This is a lot better… you can  try on this and this and this, and this as well… what are your sizes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  know, I don’t even know,” Kaname admitted, looking distastefully at the  clothes Momomi was piling over one arm. They were very… bright. “Not  the red. We don’t have to do red, right? I mean, my hair’s <em>blue. </em>If that isn’t some god’s way of telling me I have a certain colour scheme, I don’t know what is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Red  would be a nice contrast, I think,” Momomi said. “For a jacket, anyway.  It’d go very nicely with your eyes. Not to mention your pale skin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Did you have to put it like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  raised it in those terms. Besides, we’ll need to measure you up at some  point. In the meantime, I’ll just guess and you can correct me if I’m  too far off, once you’re trying them on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, hey,” Kaname said. “Isn’t there something wrong with this picture?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you whining about now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I never whine about anything!” Kaname coughed. “But what I meant was, shouldn’t we be getting some clothes for you as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll  do that afterwards,” Momomi replied. “In the meantime, I want to play  with my doll while I still can. Besides, if shopping for your own  clothes bores shopping for mine will probably be even worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t think there’s such a thing as even worse,” Kaname quipped. “So  I’m going to find something for you as well. This isn’t just you  forcing me into things, I can play as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I thought you hated this kind of thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged. “I do. But I might as well hate it while knowing something about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  stalked around the shelves, trying to get a handle on this shopping  thing. “This feels incredibly luxurious, you know,” she murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It does?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  at home I wear what cast-offs and charity-shop clothes my mother can  find, and I’d better be grateful, or she’ll knock the stuffing out of  me… that kind of environment. So this feels weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you had a happy home life too,” Momomi replied quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname moved closer to her friend under the guise of looking at some T-shirts. “Why didn’t you tell me before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About dad getting… well, you know. It never felt appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you about my father,” Kaname said reproachfully. “All of it.” <em>I  don’t think T-shirts are Momomi’s thing. She’s an elegant girl, however  I look at it, so I should try to find something that matches that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well… your father’s dead. He can stay as a ghost in your past.” Momomi sighed. “I’m not so fortunate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname’s fists balled. “From now on, I’ll definitely protect you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled softly. “We shouldn’t be thinking about such gloomy things, you know. Why didn’t you ask before, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It never felt appropriate. Not when you’d gone through so much anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  guess so.” Momomi held up a blue jumper and frowned. “You know, I think  I’ll go and look at men's wear after this. It really does seem to suit  you more…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thanks a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That was a compliment. I’ve told you a dozen times but you don’t listen, you’re a handsome girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  huffed, putting her hands on her hips. “Well, as someone who’s less in  denial about being a girl than you think, I can’t help but wonder  whether <em>handsome</em> is a word I should be happy about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Would you prefer it if I called you beautiful?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname tried to find a reply to that, and failed miserably. <em>I think I’d like that. I don’t think I should.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  stopped worrying about it when she found a long-sleeved white shirt  with frills. It was obnoxiously, pretentiously elegant, hardly  something any normal girl would ever wear… it was Momomi through. <em>Guess they stock with Astraea in mind, too. </em>She looked sidelong at her friend, picking out one of the smaller sizes, and held it up. “How about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For you or for me?” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For you. I could never carry something like this off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t know,” Momomi frowned. “I think you could. Maybe something with a ruff, you’d make a great elegant ballroom man.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Again with the teasing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Teasing? That was a compliment!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Some compliment…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not my fault you’d make such a good-looking man!” Momomi stuck her tongue out at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Right. You can try this on in a minute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  walked over, flicking through the rack with a deft ease despite the  dozen assorted clothes already in her arms. “And one for you, too. You  know, we should do that, actually. Have one matching outfit. Wouldn’t  that be fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More like childish,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, come on. Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  we look so different, for a start,” Kaname said. “As you so kindly  remind me every two minutes, I’m kinda mannish. And you’re the girl’s  girl’s doll type.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah, but doesn’t that make us a better pair?” Momomi asked, her smile teasing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed and folded. <em>When  she smiles like that, I know to give up right now. I’m only going to  cave to it in the end anyway. And still, somehow, I like it.</em></span></p>
