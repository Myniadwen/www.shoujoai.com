<p>“It’s raining.” </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed deeply. “It is, indeed, raining. Very heavily, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think it’ll stop raining if we wait for long enough?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t say for sure.” Kaname stared up at the dark sky. “But something  is telling me that that isn’t going to happen.” She shifted her grip on  the hamper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We sure have bad luck, don’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What can I  say? God hates lesbians.” Kaname chuckled. “You know, there’s no way  I’d have been able to say that this time two weeks ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And not  out of religious devotion, either.” Momomi pouted, staring at the foul  weather. “But this isn’t even funny. Every time we try and go on a  date, something goes wrong, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Next time we can check the weather forecasts, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess so, but still. They’re not going to be accurate for us, now are  they? It’s hardly fair.” Momomi shook her head. “You know, I think  you’re right. This probably is some kind of divine retribution.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked. “Gonna go off and become a nun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Screw  that. I’m not going to ruin my life for the convenience of any  hypothetical omnipotent overlord. Until he writes me a polite letter,  at the vest least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know what I’d do with a letter like that?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. Do tell?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d e-bay it. It’s gotta be worth something, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “I think you’d have to prove its authenticity, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m sure he can write it using the tears of angels for ink or  something.” Kaname folded her arms behind her head. “I mean, he’s God.  I’m sure he’ll be able to do something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure  we’re missing the point, but I’m not sure if I care.” Momomi closed her  eyes and smiled. “To be honest, he doesn’t have anything good to say to  me anyway. So why struggle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just a test from God, so you  should still lead a holy life.” Kaname dropped the hamper and stuck her  hands in her pockets. “Isn’t that what your sister would say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably.” Momomi sighed. “I’m somewhat glad she can’t see us now. But I don’t think I should have to be ashamed either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if you get down to it, religion is a gamble. For Christianity, they  make the stakes infinite, and I’m pretty sure that if that’s the case  it’s foolish to risk it…” Kaname ran a hand through her fringe. “But if  you think like that, you’re probably damned anyway. So screw it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Screw it, and curse this blasted rain,” Momomi groaned. “Not fair! Not fair! The universe is picking on us!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname folded her arms. “So? What do you want to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned thoughtfully. “Let’s see… well, I guess we can wait here for now, and hope it clears up. Is that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Why not? I don’t have any better ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sat on the steps and tucked her knees beneath her chest. She looked up,  watching the rain fall down. “It’s surprisingly pretty, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Provided  you’re not standing in it, yes,” Kaname replied, sitting by her. “This  is the kind of weather where you want to be inside looking out, in two  jumpers and an extra insulating layer of smug satisfaction as you think  of all the mugs who are suffering out in the cold and wet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled. “Well, quite. That can be our back-up plan.” She smiled at  the rain. “But it’s a cliché, isn’t it? Kissing in the rain? Happens  all the time in books and films.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Probably, yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wanna try it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And catch hypothermia? Fuck that, if you’ll excuse my language.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “My, my. Where’s your sense of adventure?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure it’s overrated, that’s all I’m saying.” Kaname glanced at her. “We can kiss just fine right here, can’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that a request?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a concession. Be happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  always such a savage negotiator.” Momomi leaned over and kissed her  briefly, before pulling back and grinning. “Well, I’ll forgive you for  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Rain’s a cliché for other stuff too, right? Break-ups and horror films spring to mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  ever, you jinx things so casually,” Momomi complained. “I’m trying to  build up an ambience, you know? Romance! It’s important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  what can I say?” Kaname asked, putting an arm round her. “I can’t play  that kind of game for long before I get self-conscious about the  ridiculousness of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds like you,” Momomi observed,  smiling and leaning into her shoulder. “Not even I can disable your  painful sense of dignity for very long.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s good, isn’t it? If  I’m not drunk on romance, I’ll probably be more reliable when the  romance is gone, right?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hypothetically, the romance wouldn’t end,” Momomi replied. “Isn’t that the ideal? Whatever else happens.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled. “You don’t say ‘forever’, do you? For you, it’s ‘I’ll be with  you provisionally, until further notice is given’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah. This is a modern age, isn’t it? People who say forever in a time of spiralling divorce rates are being dishonest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still hopeless,” Momomi sighed. “But it can’t be helped. That’s one of the things I like about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blushed. “Is that a compliment or an insult?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably both.” Momomi leaned forwards, putting her arms round Kaname’s neck. “You’ve put your scarf on wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh…”  Kaname looked upwards self-consciously as Momomi adjusted it. “I never  really wore those things before. So I suppose it’s not that surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me  neither, actually. But I have a general idea of what goes where.”  Momomi kissed her on the cheek, then leaned back. “That’s gotta be a  metaphor for us…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “Yes, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked away thoughtfully. “But these things are novel for me. They  serve a function, but not an essential one. That’s why no one would  ever have brought me something like this before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s okay.” Kaname smiled. “This one makes my neck itch, so I wasn’t missing very much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cheeky girl. Well, now I know what to get you for Christmas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you dare. I’ll make you suffer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “You’re still very bad-tempered. But never mind. What do you want for Christmas?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  could say something cliché at this juncture, but my painful dignity is  kicking in again,” Kaname noted. “To be honest, I’m not too bothered.  Horror novels are good. Ones I haven’t read.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi prodded her  on the nose. “Once again, Kaname, you’ve got no sense of romance.” She  looked away, grinning. “My mind is already overflowing with all the  possible things I could get you, I can assure you, so I doubt I’ll be  as kind as all that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why ask me?” Kaname queried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because it was your chance to say something cliché,” Momomi teased. “But forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you want, then? Nothing embarrassing, I hope?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. Who do you think I am?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t answer that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shook her head. “As cruel as ever… but I don’t know. If it’s actually  put to me, I can’t find an easy answer. Something like… let’s see… I  know. How about we get each other surprise presents?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surprise presents?” Kaname asked. “Doesn’t that just mean we both end up with presents we don’t like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not the point! Or rather, that unintentional comedy is exactly the  point!” Momomi smirked. “I want to see what you’ll get me if I don’t  give you any advice at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s going to make it such a pain!” Kaname complained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly! It’s a labour of love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  bloody stupid,” Kaname muttered. “And it’ll leave us running back to  town for refunds the moment the shops are open again, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. I’m sure we know each other better than that.” Momomi touched  her cheek. “Besides, we’re both pretty easy to please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  raised her hands. “Fine. You got it. I give up. When your voice takes  on that wheedling tone, I know I’m screwed. Surprise presents it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi kissed her cheek again. “Good girl. Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname watched the rain for a while longer. “Say, Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you celebrate Christmas with your family?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. We’re good Catholics, after all,” Momomi replied evenly, with  just a hint of sarcasm. “So we go through the whole thing. All the  ceremonies at Church, candles and whatnot. We’ll be doing that here as  well, won’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. We did last year.” Kaname sighed. “It gets a little tiring, what can I say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell  me about it. But yeah, we went through all the motions of religion. We  also had the extended Phareli family to stay for about a week, which  was always a painful experience.” Momomi sighed. “There’s a permanent  state of cold war between my parents the main family and everyone else,  both because we’re the richest and because of my father’s infidelity.  They never treat us gently. Even their children don’t think much of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  kind of stuff pisses me off,” Kaname muttered. “Parents can do what  they like, but if they’re dragging their children into their spats  that’s just too low and pathetic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, we all learn from  our parents, after all.” Momomi frowned. “Uncle Isacco, Araldo’s dad,  is generally reasonable. But Uncle Gaetano is an incredibly obnoxious  guy and Aunt Chiara’s family is no better. The old ones are the worst,  though. Between money and religion, one of them have much time for us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why do they get invited every year, then?” Kaname demanded. “Sounds stupid to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the done thing,” Momomi replied bitterly. “My father always does the done thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hate crap like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I’ll say one thing. Perversely, I almost enjoyed that week, even though  it reduced Yukaho to tears.” Momomi looked out through the rain. “For  that week, we could do no wrong. For that week, my father’s coldness  and rage and aloof arrogance and everything else were directed  outwards, at the others, protecting us and dominating everyone. It’s  stupid, I know. It’s only because of his pride, I know. But still,  those were the only times where I could really feel like we were a  family that he loved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s pretty perverse,” Kaname noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. Messed up, isn’t it?” Momomi smiled weakly. “Never mind. But we  had the ritual Christmas for the family. Big, expensive, pompous and  whatever else. Then a ball in the evening. I couldn’t stand the  occasion. Afterwards, though, I think it was Yukaho who started the  tradition… we all came down and gave each other our real presents, and  talked like a family. Even my father came.” Momomi sighed again. “I  really don’t understand that man.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “I know the  feeling. With my mother, it was the same. In reverse, I suppose. We  were always visiting some relative, somewhere, and they all hated us.  She didn’t change much, though. She still didn’t approve of me. But  still, even when I was a kid, I looked at her at those times and  noticed just how lonely she was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not a kind world, is it?”  Momomi smiled weakly. “Say, did you go back home to your mother last  Christmas? Or did you stay here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “I stayed here. My mother was clear she didn’t want me around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder whether she meant that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If she wanted to see me, she should have just said that,” Kaname snapped. “I’m not playing a bloody guessing game with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed. “I wonder. I’ve never met your mother, but this may be where  your dishonesty comes from. It sounds like she values her dignity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s nothing like me!” Kaname snapped indignantly. “When she says these things, she means it. I should know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged. “Well, I don’t know her well enough to say either way. That  reminds me, though. My family will probably invite me back for  Christmas… perhaps. Luigia and Yukaho will want that. I doubt Rodrigo  will be as benevolent. I guess it depends on what he thinks will be  more painful for me. But it’s a possibility, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would you go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “I don’t know. I’d rather spend the time with you, but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I could see Luigia, I’d like that as well. I still miss her, sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her briefly. “It must be nice. To have someone like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “I guess you could come too, though? How about it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dragging  your girlfriend to that kind of party would be one hell of a way to  intensify the cold war,” Kaname observed. “Especially as I hate that  kind of situation. It wouldn’t work at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder…” Momomi  frowned thoughtfully. “You know, if we made it known there, at that  time of year, my father would back us up. I’m sure of it. Under those  conditions his pride is everything and his family is an extension of  himself. The more they disapproved of us, the more he’d support us. And  that’d set a precedent he’d be unable to escape from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grunted. “Quite the hypocrite, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  proud people are hypocrites,” Momomi noted, smiling. “I know a lot of  them. But on the whole, I think it’d be better if we avoided the family  drama, for now. If I’m in the same position when I’m seventeen, though,  that might be a plan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname groaned. “Hopefully I won’t be the one involved with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi prodded her on the shoulder. “You really know what to say to make a woman happy, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, I say what I think. Honesty is good, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes. But not always. My fragile ego needs massaging from time to time, you know? Self-esteem is important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Your fragile ego? Excuse me while I go and laugh up my lungs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  prodded her again. “Nasty as ever. But what will the others do, I  wonder? Olesa and Amiki will definitely go and see their family, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion…  Shion will go and see her parents too, I think. She sounds like she  gets on well with them, doesn’t she? Her father, at least.” Momomi  smiled. “And the Etoiles will probably be with one set of parents or  the other too, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded again. “Honestly, I can’t  imagine that. Kariya in France’s softest heartland, or Serané amongst  the gun-totting gangsters or whatever devils spawned Kariya in the  first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, I know. Sounds like a bad set-up for a  romantic comedy, doesn’t it?” Momomi smirked. “Meet the Parents:  Lesbian Edition. Will Kari-chan be able to impress Serané’s parents  without killing anyone over wounded pride, resorting to blackmail or  get caught screwing their daughter on a table?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname winced. “Damnit, why do you always have such a graphic imagination?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname is a surprising prude,” Momomi teased. “But it’s going to be pretty lonely here, isn’t it? Was it like that last year?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Pretty much. But that suits me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane… she stayed behind, didn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Yeah.” Kaname frowned. “I must admit, that surprised me. Doesn’t she have balls to attend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I thought that’d be the case.” Momomi rubbed her forehead, looking  mournful. “She said she doesn’t get on with her family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That makes three of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  I guess.” Momomi chuckled. “It’s a terrible thing to say, but that  makes her more human, doesn’t it? She isn’t actually perfect after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Kaname glanced at her. “How do you know, anyway? She isn’t talkative, now is she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  it just came up,” Momomi replied vaguely. “You know how it is. Olesa  says that’s normal, for Amane to say things, if you hang around for  long enough. Even if it’s only because she starts talking aloud in your  presence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, looking away unhappily. <em>Just what is it, her relationship with Amane? That cold bitch wouldn’t mention anything like that voluntarily. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s wrong?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. Nothing.” Kaname glanced at her, smiling. “I was just thinking that you have a lot more friends now, than you did before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right. Jealous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a little,” Kaname admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no need to be.” Momomi put a hand on her knee, smiling gently. “I’m the one here with you, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. I know already. It’s not like I have a decent reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then that’s fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-” Kaname sighed. “I told you before. Things were easier then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  what do you want me to do?” Momomi asked. “I can talk to Amane less if  you insist. But it’d be a shame, as I’m finally beginning to understand  her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. It is fine. It’s not your fault, or something you  should change.” Kaname shrugged. “But it’s just who I am. I have a  problem with people, especially people in large numbers. They get even  stupider and a lot more violent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one’s going to attack you,  you know.” Momomi frowned thoughtfully, touching her lips with a  finger. “Unless you deserve it, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, already. I’m  not stupid. But what with one thing and another, I’d be content to  drift through school without being noticed.” Kaname sighed. “At the  same time, I want to be the one who exceeds the Etoiles with you.  Contradictory, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little,” Momomi replied. “But I think I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname raised her eyebrows. “You do? I wish I did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  about your habit of having your cake and eating it,” Momomi teased.  “Fame without effort. Rather like our dear Amane-san, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right.” Kaname rolled her eyes. “That’s not it at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “You actually said that? I think I win by default.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Screw  you,” Kaname grumbled. “That’s not the point, though. I like people in  the abstract, if they’re looking at me anyway, but not to talk too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The same as Amane. Do you two have some kind of condition, or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane  doesn’t even want to be famous, so forget her,” Kaname complained.  “This isn’t the point, though. It’s just a bother, that’s all. It’s  hard to explain. I guess you could say I want fans but no friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “That hardly makes Amane happy, now does it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. It sounds stupid, I know. But I suppose that’s how I feel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about me?” Momomi asked. “Or would it be okay if you had a lot of fangirls instead?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t screw around,” Kaname retorted. “You’re the important one. Without you, it wouldn’t work at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. I didn’t ask to be completely miserable like Amane, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. “I see. Well, sometimes it’s hard to tell. But isn’t it fun? When we’re with Amiki, Olesa and Shion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “I suppose so. But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s still less peaceful. We get dragged into more things. Everything becomes more complicated, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  doesn’t that give us something to do?” Momomi asked. “I know I’d go mad  from boredom if I just sat in room all day. Besides, how will we beat  the Etoiles like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Of course. So it’s not like I can’t deal with friends, either. I don’t know. Maybe I’m just being an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wouldn’t be new. But how about Amane? You definitely don’t like her, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Now that is for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  leaned back slightly. “Still raining… but I’ve never really understood  why you hate her. She’s privileged and lazy, certainly, but she comes  across as particularly troubled or particularly striking. I can  understand disliking her, but why hate her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you before, probably. She’s everything I hate and everything I want to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi raised her eyebrows. “Wouldn’t you hate yourself, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows?” Kaname shrugged and smiled. “If you’re talking to me about these things, get used to internal contradictions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re one big internal contradiction, Kaname, so that won’t be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why,  thank you.” Kaname tapped a finger against the ground, looking at the  falling rain. “But Amane was about the first person I noticed when I  came here, and I instantly disliked her. She also became the one to  always beat me, and the one who had what I wanted. Like you say, she  has achieved fame without effort.” Kaname scratched her cheek, closing  her eyes. “No, that’s not fair. She’s put effort until her horse  riding. But still, why that? Why not calligraphy or kendo or whatever?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because everyone knows the handsome prince rides a beautiful white horse,” Momomi observed wryly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. The worst thing is, that may well be the reason…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, I still have some things to say to Amane,” Momomi noted.  “And, to be frank, if she wants to keep talking to us in the mornings I  won’t stop her. It’ll be good for her, and you as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  sound too much like my parent.” Kaname sighed deeply, staring into the  heart of the rain. The leaves on the trees shook as they were  enraptured by the wind, darting chaotically back and forwards before  tearing free and fluttering down. It was a bizarre and beautiful scene.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can say that when you brush your own hair. Until then, I’m mother, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I’m not sure, with you two, which one it is I’m jealous of, exactly,” Kaname murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  my girlfriend, the person who understands me, and I don’t like it when  you go near her. I don’t like it all. She’s won at everything else,  after all. Why shouldn’t she take you from me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi touched  her arm gently. “Don’t be stupid. I’m not that fickle, already, so  don’t insult my intelligence. This round was yours, despite your bad  leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “I know. I know that, and I trust you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rested her head on Kaname’s shoulder. “I’ll forgive you, just so long as you understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But for Amane, as well, it annoys me,” Kaname observed. “I’m not quite sure, really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because it’s her? You’ve told me before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  there’s someone, anyone, she talks to. Because she has the cheek to act  like a normal girl, rather than a freakish prodigal heiress. Because it  makes her less than perfect, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that worse for  you?” Momomi asked. “Don’t you want your rival to be a fallible human?  Because she’s that, she’s nothing but that, and I can’t pretend  otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re wrong,” Kaname replied. “If I’m going to be  defeated, if I’m going to be humiliated, if I’m going to hate someone  that way, it’s better that they’re perfect. That casts a better light  on me, who is cracked. It’s not my fault for losing if I never stood a  chance to begin with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “That’s the logic of a loser, isn’t it? I don’t like it. It doesn’t suit you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know.” Kaname slid her arm around Momomi’s waist, looking out into the  storm. “Things are different now, because you’re here now. But the  person I was before thought that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled, nuzzling her girlfriend’s shoulder gently. “You’ve got better at admitting your dependence on me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The first step is acceptance, after all,” Kaname replied absently. “But that’s Amane, again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was actually the first to notice her. Well, one of the first. Before  she really had fangirls, I talked to her a little and watched her a lot  and realised just who she was. She was my stereotype of everything I  feared about this school. So perhaps that’s why it bothers me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me spending time with her?” Momomi queried. “Because she’s been your rival for all that time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps  that. Perhaps not.” Kaname’s free hand slapped the floor. “I’ve always  watched her, and she’s always been there. Amane was an overwhelmingly  consistent presence in a life that was constantly in flux. Even if I  hated her, at least it was something I could understand. That was why I  always came back and watched.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry. That didn’t make much sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I understand. I said the same thing to Amane.” Momomi smiled. “About you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “I see. Yes, that makes sense. It was probably the same for me. But you weren’t as good at it, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Momomi raised her head, looking annoyed. “Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  knew you too well,” Kaname replied, smiling slightly. “Even though I  tried to pretend you were another demon, it didn’t work out. Not when I  saw you come home bleeding from the other girls, watched you struggle  to make friends and find a place, heard you cry for your sister in the  night-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flushed, looking down. “You heard that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.  I know I wasn’t supposed to. So I could tell you. I told you  everything. I’m not sure whether I wanted to give you a chance to  understand me or a chance to hate you forever after all.” Kaname  shrugged slightly, reaching out with a gentle hand and touching  Momomi’s hair. “It doesn’t matter. You showed me how you could touch me  as well as stab me. After that, you ceased to be a monster.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled, moving closer to the warmth of Kaname’s body. “You always  overcomplicate things, don’t you? But it was you who did it, in the  end. You who said it all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In expectation of your cruelty,” Kaname muttered. “You were the one who stepped beyond that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps. We shouldn’t argue about this, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane,  though.” Kaname raised her left hand and unfolded it, looking between  the splayed fingers at the trees. Behind them, she knew, was the  paddock. “Amane has always been aloof and careless. She’s always been  perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I never thought I’d hear you say that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  perfect demon,” Kaname finished, her hand clenching into a fist. Her  expression was blank. “Someone I can hate forever and ever. That’s all  she is to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that it, then?” Momomi asked quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  I approach her and she talks to me, when she approaches us and talks to  you, it doesn’t work, does it? She’s less than perfect, she’s only  human.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “Perhaps you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before  that made sense, though. Not so much anymore.” Momomi shifted sideways,  raising both her hands and placing them on Kaname’s shoulders. “You  don’t have to hate, do you? You don’t need that control and release,  because you have something better.” She hugged her girlfriend from  behind, turning her head and whispering gently. “Can’t you let it go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  enjoyed her warm embrace for a few moments, closing her eyes. Then she  shook her head. “For as long as I have my own aspirations, I’ll need to  hate her. And she still owes me for all the suffering that she caused  me before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed unhappily. “It can’t be very healthy for you, to use hatred of another person to drive your aspirations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  That’s true. But are you any different?” Kaname chuckled. “My father,  my father, my father… his money, his rules, his attitude, your  independence, you aspire to free of him, because you hate him. It’s the  same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not the same. He’s my father, someone personal to me. You barely know Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And she embodies what I despise,” Kaname retorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m an aristocrat too, aren’t I?” Momomi said hotly. “What’s the point  in hating us all? Isn’t that just as bigoted and stupid as her hate for  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t hate you, though,” Kaname replied. “Quite the opposite. I like you, Momomi, because of your aspiration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Now you’re just being confusing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  be honest, it would be nice for me if Amane always remained this way,”  Kaname noted. “Perhaps I should do that. Perhaps I’ll make sure she’s  the untouchable, inviolable one, whoever tries to approach her… I’m  sure I can do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s grip tightened. “I won’t let you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed. “Of course. You can carry on beavering away at the dam of my convictions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  your convictions are based on an illusions, they’re worse than  pathetic,” Momomi replied steadily. “I’ll tear them down for your sake.  It’s my duty as your girlfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Good answer.” She slid forwards then flopped back, her head ending up on Momomi’s lap. “Well, this is nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing?” Momomi demanded, sounding annoyed. “Playing around with me like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks  for letting me have that conversation.” Kaname smiled. “It was  important, I think. Even if it wasn’t, it made me feel better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  made you sound very obsessive, you know,” Momomi complained, running  her hands idly through the short blue hair. “Don’t be so worrying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  smirked. “What can I say? I’m very obsessive.” She reached up, touching  Momomi’s face. “But that means that when I am looking at you, you have  my full and undivided attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned down at her. “Compliments aren’t going to stop me from talking to Amane, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  that’s fine. I wasn’t talking in more than hypothetical terms for now.  If your mind is made up, you are way too hard to shift.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’d  still suit me fine both ways, if you didn’t talk to each other,  though,” Kaname teased. “What can I say? A girl can dream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you pretend to be a cold pragmatist, you’re actually an idealist,” Momomi noted cynically. “That’s pretty troublesome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you’ll have to forgive me for that. I’ll try to make it up to you.”  Kaname glanced up at her. “So what’s your dream? Freedom from your  parents, an independent life here, but what about your dream of the  present?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could say something cliché at this juncture, but I  won’t,” Momomi imitated. “But my actual dream is pretty cliché too. I  just want to be someone people look at. Someone like Amane. The same as  you, but without the schizophrenia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grinned. “I thought  so. My dream’s a little different, though. I remember now. It has a lot  to do with everything that I said before, and my desire to Amane to be  perfect and untouched, but there’s a narrower significance as well. Why  make her perfect, after all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To protect your precious fragile ego, apparently,” Momomi noted distastefully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.  Not entirely. If I lose, it’s that. But if I win, that makes it even  better, right?” Kaname closed her eyes. “I can’t really control Amane.  Even I know that. So I just have to beat her instead, while she’s the  rival I want her to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “So now you’re being hyper-competitive again. Just my luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sat up and turned, facing her. “Wrong again. Your dream and mine can be  the same thing, and I want you to be happy as well.” She smiled,  raising her right hand. “So how about it? If we work together, we can  achieve great things. I’m sure of it. This time will be different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled indulgently. “You’re very skittish today, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve been giving me a lot to think about. But really, I’m just honouring a promise I made long ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  took her hand. “If you put it like that, I can’t refuse on principle.”  A moment later, she leaned forwards, kissing Kaname on the lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname accepted graciously then moved back slightly, nodding. “Well, this should be fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do know you have to audition for the play now, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. I’m aware of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know.” Kaname sighed. “I’m going to really regret this in half an hour. But right now, I’m still fired up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll do fine. It’s your chance to beat Amane, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ice prince Amane, my inviolate one,” Kaname muttered. “Such a convenient rival, isn’t she? I’m lucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That won’t stop me from talking to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. Why do you always get the better end of these deals?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t come up with grand plans in my lap,” Momomi retorted, smiling. “It’s definitely going to be distracting for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. That’s got nothing to do with it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I still don’t quite get why, though. Why do you have to beat her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  prove I can, I think,” Kaname replied. “Just as I came here to prove I  can. Just as you’re going to become someone exceptional to prove you  can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose you’re right.” Momomi ran a hand through her  hair. “So these the important dreams and aspirations Amane went on  about. Is this what she had in mind when she talked about them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You talked to her about that stuff?” Kaname asked, surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “At some length. She thinks about it a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does Amane dream of?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi was silent for a while, then she spoke. “Someone who can understand her. I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that all?” Kaname complained. “That’s pretty lame…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  very important.” Momomi stood, brushing herself off then offering  Kaname her hand. “Once you have someone like that, everything else  follows.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Kaname asked carelessly, grabbing her hand and standing. “What a convenient world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More so than you’d think.” Momomi looked over her shoulder. “The rain’s stopped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, turning around. “I see. Well, let’s go then.” She picked up the hamper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded without letting go of Kaname’s hand. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
