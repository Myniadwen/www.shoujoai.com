<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">This was  intended to be the battle chapter, but it's ended up the preparation  for battle chapter. The problem is Kanamomo, predictably. I have a  perfectly good muse to act as a middleman but they're not having any of  that. They keep badgeringly me directly and instructing me on new  scenes to write. I'm possessed, I tell you.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Kaname opened her eyes, yawning and trying to push her mind that little bit further until she was properly awake. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It  would be very easy to fall back into the comfortable, lazy inertia of  sleep… or rather, that’s what nature intends, but I know better. If I  surrender to nature’s voice I’ll get prodded by a rather more  insistent, higher-pitched voice belonging to a certain brown-haired  tyrannical perfectionist fluffball. Sorry, nature, but you wired it  yourself so fear’s one of the greatest incentives in this world.  Consciousness, here I come! </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you’re awake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah.”  Unexpectedly, the voice was low and soft. More unexpectedly, Momomi  wasn’t towering over her, blocking out the light and possibly  brandishing a comb and a killer intention. That was worrying enough to  make Kaname roll over and sit up slightly, only to find Momomi opposite  her, still lying in bed. “Well, this is rare,” she said, sitting up  fully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess it is,” Momomi admitted, lying where she was. “It’s Sunday, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It is,” Kaname agreed, looking slightly puzzled. <em>Well, I’m not complaining. This is too early in the morning for deep philosophical conversation, but still.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Only a day and a half until my parents go,” Momomi sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh… I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And nothing’s settled at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not  yet, but we’re getting closer. Besides, it’s simple at the end of the  day. Isn’t the path of least resistance you staying here, for him as  well as you? Arranging tutors and things must be a drag.” Kaname smiled  encouragingly, but Momomi just nodded slowly before rolling over and  looking at the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Say, Kaname, what would you do if he forced me to go? It’s not like he can’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you talking about? We’re not going to lose to that bastard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  feel a little conflicted, because I know I should hope that you  wouldn’t miss me, but I don’t. I think I’d quite like it if you missed  me. So, I was wondering…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname pushed herself off the bed, walking across the room. <em>So much for easy morning conversation.</em> “I’m not even going to dignify that with a response. Enough with that  kind of talk.” She put her hands on Momomi’s shoulders and turned the  girl over forcibly. “God, it’s too early in the morning for this… we’re  us, right? Don’t settle for defeat and stupid thoughts like that!  You’ll stay with me! I’ll stay with you! We’ll win! That’s the way it  is, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi stared at up at her with wide eyes, and  abruptly she noticed that for once she was very close, no, touching,  her best friend in a state of near undress, still warm with the sweat  of her slumber. Kaname raised her hands and stepped back, blushing  slightly. “Sorry,” she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi just stared at her for a  moment, then sighed and pushed herself up. “No, thank you.” She ran her  hands through her tangled hair. “I guess I shouldn’t talk when I’ve  just woken up. I end up asking stupid things like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, it’s fine.” Kaname sat on the bed beside her. “But what’s up? A bad dream?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  smiled softly. “In a manner of speaking, but really nothing so  exciting. I woke up earlier than was good for me and ended up thinking  more than is healthy for me… it’s pretty easy to be full of doubts,  like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is why I said, I have to make sure you don’t  think for too long,” Kaname said righteously. “You’re hopeless when you  do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess that’s true, but…” Momomi hugged her knees.  “It’s just something I worry about, you know? Not the thing about  whether you’ll miss me or not, that’s not important… it hurts that I  have to risk this much, when I could still lose everything. The old me  tried to make sure that I’d have nothing to lose, but the moment I  decided to fight, it all broke down…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even if you might get  hurt, that’s better. The other way of living’s pathetic. When you don’t  live at all because you’re afraid of the scars it might live behind,  that’s just too useless.” Kaname looked at the ceiling. “I can say that  so confidently because I used to be the same. You saved me from that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  nodded. “You’re right. I can’t live in fear of him, that’s just  gratifying him. But it’s just so… unfair, that I have to beg my own  father to let me stay with my friends and everything that’s actually  important in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Look at it as if it was a chance,” Kaname  suggested. “This way, you can prove to yourself and others that you’re  independent of him. That’s what you want, right? And you’ll never feel  quite right until you’ve done it, as far as I can tell.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled, looking at the floor. “You know me too well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you’re easier to read than you’d like to think, because I know you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, you’re a little hypocritical, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  laughed at me when I was surprised to see you naked last time. But  right now, I’m less than naked, and you jumped three feet back  yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, well…” <em>I was far too naïve about that, and now I know better.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  gave her an amused look when she failed to complete that sentence. “Are  things different now, then?” She kept her voice light, but that didn’t  fool Kaname. There was an edge of worry there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course not. Do  you think I’d be that accommodating? I’m not going to change for your  convenience, you know.” Kaname folded her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi raised her eyebrows. “Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  the way it should be,” Momomi said, though she gave Kaname a doubtful  look. “It could be a little troublesome for me, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname felt a little shock grip her despite herself at that. <em>What does she mean? She’s being as enigmatic as ever, damn her…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  you know, that’s a very frustrating thing about this situation. I don’t  care too much for my father’s opinions, but when they say what they  say, it’s more than I can bear.” Momomi’s fists balled and she looked  away. “Sometimes I want nothing more than to be able to grab them and  shake some sense into them. Sometimes I wonder whether it would be  worth it to sacrifice my place her in exchange for one chance to tell  that bastard to tell some simple truths.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About people like you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About me, and people like me,” Momomi agreed. “It’s hurtful, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Things have changed between us, in more ways than one. She never would have admitted that before. </em>“I  do know. I do know what it feels like, to be shunned for something far  beyond your control…” Kaname closed her eyes. “I was the same when I  came here, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About your background?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah. But don’t get a persecution complex about it, okay? I don’t forgive people like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled. “You’re not the type who would.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  used to be like that, before I met you.” Kaname folded her arms behind  her head. “Hey, do you know why I told you about my past?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because  you wanted someone to listen,” Momomi said. “And to express your  self-hate to someone, in a kind of catharsis. And because there was no  one else and after living in silence for so long, you wanted to be able  to tell your story.” She cocked her head in amusement. “I’m not the  kind of person who will be so convenient as to simply ask you why  without taking a few plugs at an answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Naturally. But you’re  wrong.” Kaname fell back onto Momomi’s bed, looking at the ceiling.  “Well, actually you have some fairly accurate points. But that wasn’t  the one I meant. I told you that story because I wanted you to hate me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you thought that would do it? What did you expect me to do? Say, oh, you’re a child of a rape, get away from me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  wanted you to feel disturbed and out of your depth, and back away from  me,” Kaname said. “Most of all, I wanted you to be disgusted by my  poverty and upbringing, I wanted you to reel away from me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because…  I don’t know, exactly.” Kaname closed her eyes. “Because I’d lived my  life by notions of the ignorance and hate of all aristocrats. Because I  was starting to enjoy your company and that frightened me. Because I  thought it improper for me to be anything but alone. I didn’t show it,  but I was pretty fucked up at that time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you wanted me to hate you, you’d have to do a lot better than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  when I told the story it didn’t exactly come out the way I’d expected  it. And it definitely didn’t end the way I’d intended it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When I hugged you?” Momomi asked, blushing slightly at the memory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  was definitely the start of it, and that really did shock me.” Kaname  sighed. “But even though things changed between us after that, it  didn’t after that. You felt my pain but you didn’t pity me. You never  let me use that past as an excuse for my bad behaviour. You still held  me responsible and treated me the same way as before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think that’s exactly me being a saint,” Momomi said. “I’ve always been preoccupied by own problems, to be honest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  was the best thing to do. It brought me out of the past, a little.”  Kaname grinned. “Basically, you didn’t give a damn about all that  stuff. No, like I said, you empathised. But you didn’t give a damn  about that in the wider me. I was glad when I noticed that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  guess my attitude’s the same as yours,” Momomi said. “Don’t start to  think that the world revolves around your own tragedies… its good  advice. But why are you raising this now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because we may not  get another chance.” Kaname turned and laughed at Momomi’s expression.  “I’m kidding you. I told you, we’re going to win.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi lay back herself, smiling in return. “Yeah, yeah, you reminded me of that. So, why now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not sure, exactly. It felt like a good time, but sometimes I do things without a good reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I appreciate it.” Momomi let her body relax, her hair a languorous halo  about her. “Life would be a lot less interesting without your  spontaneity. But I’m always surprised, Kaname. You can be very deep at  times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Again with the backhanded compliments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I mean  it, though. When you apply that mind of yours normally reserved for  complex metaphors to yourself and your problems, you have a startling  level of self awareness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s with the benefit of hindsight,  and in that, I’m not unusual. Anyone could do this if only they  realised the need to do so. Now, if I could understand these things  about my present, then I’d find life a lot easier than I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  very telling of you,” Momomi said softly. “Of course, it’s very telling  of you that you’ve learned to apply your mind to your difficulties, not  those of other people’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The way I see it, if we all looked  after our own problems, the world would be at peace. As it is, people  can’t even do that, and so it falls to the hyper-competent or the  unburdened to help many people instead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, the Etoiles are that kind of person, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  considered this. “You’re right. I’d say they’re the unburdened ones,  but I can’t exactly make that remark in light of recent events.” She  folded her arms, hugging herself while she looked upwards. “Of course,  I could do that as well, but I lack both the inclination and the time.  As I’ve said before, I’m pretty screwed up myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m the same, but you’ve made the observation yourself. So let’s stop sulking and get up, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname pushed herself up. “So I dragged you out of your funk after all. Let’s go, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  giggled, sitting up besides her. “You say that, but you had things you  wanted to say as well, so you took the chance. I guess everyone thinks  slightly weird things in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, at least I don’t think slightly weird things all the time,” Kaname said, looking at her. “That’s more than you can say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I’m not particularly ashamed of that. And you’re worse.” She looked  slightly odd, with her hair in disarray and sweat beading her skin. <em>It’s  an unfamiliar sight to someone used to her pristine presentation for  the majority of her time, hair in perfect order and skin smooth and  clean, but… strangely endearing, I guess. It reminds me that she’s just  a teenage girl too, and more than that, a cute one, with a winningly  childish charm. Somehow it suits her to look like this. </em>Kaname suppressed a chuckle at the thought. <em>Which  is more than I can say for myself in the mornings. I wish I had that  kind of trick, but it’s expected from someone like her, with that  superficial perfection. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Dismissing that thought, she raised  her voice. “That doesn’t exactly excuse you, you know, just because I  do it. Isn’t that another way of dodging responsibility for one’s  actions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps not, but it does mean you have no right to  comment on such a thing,” Momomi said, prodding her on the nose.  “That’s only fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Honour amongst thieves, eh?” Kaname shook her head theatrically. “I’ve been there, done that, and I didn’t find anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  more about not being a hypocrite than anything like that. But I suppose  you fail that test so badly that it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, hey, who are you to say that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You just said that defence is meaningless, so I can say what I like, can’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As  a blatant hypocrite, it’s well within my rights to say something like  that with a straight face. There’s no point in fighting my nature, is  there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You can’t do what you like because I gave you an  arbitrary label, you know! This is the same as your earlier persecution  complex!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And I told you,” Kaname said. “Just because I’m saying  you shouldn’t do something, doesn’t mean I have to do it myself. That’s  the starting point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smirked. “Say what you like, but we’re going to quit stalling. That won’t work any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What have I done now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m going to the bathroom. In the meantime, you get yourself dressed and rub off your morning face.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Like you can talk…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We covered that already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I give it up,” Kaname sighed. “It gets rid of all my favourite retorts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly!”  Momomi pouted in mock anger, standing up and talking towards the  bathroom. She stopped by the door, looking over her shoulder. “So sit  there and stew in your own hypocrisy. I’ll be right back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname laughed at the closing door, rubbing her cheek and smiling warmly. <em>Days  like this feel so good. No, even days like this… things should be  worrying right now, for all my tough talk that’s for her, but I find it  impossible to be pessimistic. I don’t know quite why. More and more,  I’ve been looking at the past the way I do, and I wonder whether she  even remembers how different things are now, from how they are then.  Oh, we still snap at each other and fool around, but the… atmosphere,  the ambience, it’s completely different. And as ever, I can see the  past but not the present, so I’ve got no idea why, except that this  must be friendship. Well, it’s unlike anything I’ve ever experienced  before, but that’s not exactly surprising from me. Even if I call those  others friends the way she does, too, I can’t say it’s anything like  that. But I guess I just don’t spend as much time with them, and  besides, my guard’s up. Somehow Momomi’s managed to get past that and  make me relax, and the worst thing is, it’s not even as if she  consciously tried to get through to me. It just… happened. Well, it  suits me fine, for as long as she’s the only one with that scary  talent. Even recently, I wasn’t sure whether I could trust her, but I  know now, I can afford to be a little vulnerable to her. Oh, she’ll  tease me, but it’s not like I can’t give as good as I got on that  front. And because she does the same with me, it’s fine. It’s a weird  thought, that I’ve come this far from my defensive values. But only  Momomi. Somehow, I can’t imagine being this free or comfortable with  anyone else. She’s indispensable, though I’m not going to tell her as  much. She might get the wrong idea. But that’s why I won’t lose. I  can’t afford to.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">If she kept thinking, she could spend the  whole morning turning over one thing, then another. Better to get  moving while she still had the chance, on reflection. She got off  Momomi’s bed and walked across the room, picking clean underwear at  random from her drawer and starting to change. <em>Thank god Momomi  remembers to take this stuff the wash, or I’d just let it get  dirty…wait, should I allow her to do that? It doesn’t seem very proper.  Well, it’s not like I care about that kind of stuff. </em>She frowned. <em>When I look at it, I’m dependent on her this way as well. But I’m getting caught up in my thoughts again. </em>She  grabbed her shirt from her chair, unfolding it and slipping it around  her shoulders, buttoning it up from the bottom up. The light blue  material was surprisingly light and comfortable against her skin. <em>Perhaps this uniform isn’t so bad after all. </em>She grabbed her skirt and pulled it up, tucking her shirt in and straightening it slightly, trying to pull out any creases. <em>Somehow that always happens,</em> <em>something that contrasts pretty painlessly with Momomi’s effortlessness. Oh, well. It can’t be helped. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you decent?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname raised her eyebrows. “Am I ever?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  saw that one coming from a mile away.” Momomi opened the door from the  bathroom, walking past her and beginning to retrieve her own clothes.  “You need to come up with some more original banter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah,  yeah.” Kaname walked into the bathroom, splashing cold water on her  face and rubbing her eyes to dispel any signs of tiredness. Then she  cleaned her teeth, leaning against the wall with one hand and glaring  at the mirror as if it had personally offended her. She wasn’t really a  morning person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, I’ve been thinking. We have to make a move today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname imagined Momomi pulling up her shirt, buttoning it up, doing her necktie with a swift, almost absent skill. <em>I’ve  grown used to that scene and its grace, as a part of the casual grace  that is in everything she does. But she doesn’t want me to see now,  which is almost a shame. I guess it’s just, again, the trust of being  able to watch someone even in their simplest moments. Which isn’t weird  at all, or if it is weird, it’s weird because I’m so unused to having  someone I can trust. How things have changed. </em>“So, what’s the plan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  need to catch my father, before he’s flying off here or there, and just  talk to him. If I’m careful and persuasive, I may be able to make his  position one aligned to mine, as Olesa would put it. He’ll never let  himself lose an argument but he can be persuaded to shift his position  when you talk to him, he’s that kind of person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“He sounds like it. And this sounds simple enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This  is a good time, in a way. He’ll probably be glad to listen to anything  that isn’t about Serané right now… and it’s also going to do her a  favour, because it will give him some time to think about something  else and cool his normal frustration whenever he’s blocked in  something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I see. I just hope he’s not so pissed off by the  whole thing that it messes with our matter, too.” Kaname frowned at the  mirror. “I mean, we’re only lucky in that he’s even more ignorant of  others than you. If he ever noticed what this school’s actually like…  it would be pretty inconvenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To say the least. He’d  probably start worrying about contamination. Can’t let his dear  daughter be infected, now can he?” Momomi sounded bitter. “I’m sure  he’d think something like that. I don’t put it past him. If it came to  it I’m sure he’d be the first person to send me to psychiatrists asking  for a ‘cure’ for my ‘condition’, as he’d probably put it. Bastard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Oops. Sore subject, is it? </em>“Well,  at least that kind of ignorance means you can take advantage of him,”  Kaname ventured. “I mean, if he disapproved but recognised it, he’d  probably see the real world enough to read the writing on the wall, and  take you out of here as soon as he could.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess you’re right… but it feels way too foolish to be thankful that you’re father’s an ignorant bigot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  does, rather,” Kaname said, rubbing her face with the towel and  returning to their room. “But it’d take more time than we have to  re-educate him. If it’s even possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi was brushing her  hair with the concentration and seriousness of a samurai preparing for  battle, which was almost accurate. “We’ll have to skip breakfast. If I  can just pin the bastard in his room so he can’t run away, I may be  able to talk some sense into him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rubbed her nose. “Indeed. Well, I guess ribbons and a pretty smile are your weapons of war after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you mumbling about now?” Momomi complained, glancing at her by the mirror.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I just thinking you look very serious, like someone going to fight for their life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  that’s what’s happening, isn’t it?” Momomi asked. “It’s beyond me to be  all that flippant at that time, I don’t know about you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wish  I could say that. My wandering thoughts just spawned a mental image of  you in samurai garb and with a katana, and I’m trying very hard not to  crack up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Humph. You can keep your eastern weapons. I come from  a different tradition.” Momomi closed her eyes. “My ancestors were  riding on horseback in about a tonne of forged steel armour waving  swords big enough to break bone through metal on impact around the time  yours were… I don’t know… extorting money from sushi farmers, or  whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Isn’t that a point for me, though?” Kaname smirked.  “As far as I can tell, your ancestors extorted money from entire  counties. It’s just a matter of scale.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah, but the king or  prince said it’s okay, so that makes it tax and very legal,” Momomi  said in a proper way. She put her comb aside and started fiddling with  her hair, putting the last strands into place and checking it for any  mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And why does the king get to determine that kind of thing? I’ve always wondered about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because  they’re the biggest thug of all, extorting money from the whole  country?” Momomi shrugged. “If you take away the God thing, it’s just a  matter of the de facto state.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So when the yakuza say they’re  from noble origins they have a point,” Kaname said thoughtfully. “They  just didn’t go far enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Pretty much. That’s the way it is, isn’t it?” She stepped back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sat down and let Momomi run her hands through hair, searching for the inevitable tangles. <em>And  so I’d better forestall the sarcastic comments that are sure to follow.  The downside of people being this close is that it leaves you this  open. </em>“But I’ve always thought that it’s a shame. The government  really is that simple. The ones with enough power to make it work, one  way or the other. But below that the de facto state dies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  smiled, picking up the comb and moving into the bathroom to wet it.  “I’d expect this from you. The problem with that is that the party with  the most force triumphs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not saying there should be no  rules. You’d have to be far more optimistic than me to believe in  anarchism. But rules with a little context sensitivity would be nice.”  Kaname folded her arms. “For example, a world where we could choose our  own path, without being controlled by frankly unsuitable parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  smiled, taking her place again and wetting Kaname’s hair. “Now that’s a  nice thought. But it could be a little frightening, couldn’t it? The  ties of family being broken so easily by the law…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To me and  you, the ties of family have never been anything but chains,” Kaname  said, her voice low. “Unpleasantly dragging us towards suffocating  cages.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course, we both escaped to another cage, the pretty playhouse called Astraea Hill,” Momomi noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I know… but it least it’s a cage we chose for ourselves. I think that’s an improvement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  frowned, starting to pry her friend’s hair into order. “You know, I was  thinking about something similar… but for me, the cage was mental.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“At  first, I couldn’t believe that my sister and Araldo could be so stupid-  that anyone could be so stupid- to believe the things that they did.  But… after a while… I remembered.” Momomi looked glum. “It’s less  uncommon than I would have liked it to be, and it’s still not unusual.  More than that, it’s the <em>normal </em>attitude to them. They don’t see anything wrong with it, quite the opposite, I’m the wrong one to them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  can’t be helped, can it? People are always going to segregate each  other in their minds and hate those who are different from them. Always  have done, always will do. You can’t change that, but that doesn’t mean  you have to listen to it.” Kaname shrugged. “Matters are settled  between you and Luigia, so that’s enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not  that, though. I remembered that, if I hadn’t come here, I’d probably  end up just like them.” Momomi managed a smile. “How screwed up would I  be then? Feeling those things, and dismissing them and denying them and  pretending they don’t exist and hoping that they’d go away if I ignore  them… that would be what it would come to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Denial is a terrible thing,” Kaname said automatically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  what annoys me most, though. If old bigots want to be bigoted, they can  be free to do so, as far as I’m concerned. I can handle that. But when  they teach their children to think in the exact same way, I can’t stand  that. Because while they’re all damaged by it, that small percentage,  that one in twenty, are going to be serious screwed up by it, and it  might take them years to recover.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You know, if I’m the feminist, you’d make a pretty decent gay rights activist in ten years time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  serious, though.” Momomi pouted. “I was shocked and slightly horrified  myself, when I found out. It took me a while before I could be  comfortable about it, and I still worry from time to time. And this is  in Astraea, the world’s number one lesbian hotspot for teenagers  looking for good education!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wonder whether ex-students come  by with cars at terms end, looking for a date,” Kaname said  thoughtfully. “I can see that happening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know, I know. I’m just teasing you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  don’t. I’m being serious for once.” Momomi put the comb down and  stepped back, nodding to herself. “Okay. Final preparations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  pulled out a fresh pair of stockings, sitting on her chair again and  pulling them up. “Say, Momomi, I’ve been meaning to ask you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  are you going to do, once this is all settled?” Kaname picked up her  necktie and started to do it up. “You said you’d do things differently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah.  Well, I’ve been thinking about that.” Momomi grabbed her jacket and  shrugged it on, pulling it against her shoulders to set it and checking  herself in the mirror. “For a start, I’m going to make Olesa treat me  in a civil manner. Not through force or coercion. I’ll <em>make</em> her respond to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I think that was a contradiction in terms. But apart from that… why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because  I’m not like Amane, and I’m not like father. It might be convenient and  gratifying to ignore her existence, but that wouldn’t solve anything at  all. I’m going to treat her properly, which is more than the others do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess so.” <em>When  I think about it, she has a good point. I’m so dismissive of Olesa  myself… is this how Amane feels? Is it really that easy to block out  someone else’s existence? Humans really do only see what they want to  see…and that explains Momomi’s father a lot.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And what else…  I’ll play Shion’s games, too, but for her sake, rather than mine.”  Momomi folded her arms. “It’s about time that everyone knows that I am  smart, I am talented, and I’m going to take control of my life. I’m not  going to be a spectator any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Big words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And I’ll start doing my homework to a better standard, for the same reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Damn.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi slipped her shoes on and turned around, smiling. “And, I guess… I have something important to tell someone as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname quirked her eyebrows. “The cute girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Pretty much. But I’m not sure if I’ll be able to be that brave. I’d really hate to mess things up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t take it so seriously. You just have to take a shot, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Easy for you to say,” Momomi muttered. “Life’s more complicated than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  put her own shoes on. “Well, look at it this way. If she’s interested  in that kind of thing at all, I’m sure you’ll be fine. You’re pretty  and cute, and entertaining too, if a little righteous at times.” She  gave her friend an encouraging smile. “She’ll consider herself lucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Again, that’s easy to you for say,” Momomi said, turning away and facing the door quickly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s just my opinion. But I still think you should go for it.” Kaname frowned. “It’s not Amane, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi snorted, sounding very sarcastic. “Of course not. I’m not an infatuated idiot like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s Amiki’s line,” Kaname sighed. “But you’ve still got me really curious. You can hardly blame me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s fine.” Momomi sounded a little snappish. “Just forget it for now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright. You raised it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pulled open the door. “I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “I’m coming.”</span></p>
