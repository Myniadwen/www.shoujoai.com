<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you  really wouldn’t believe her, that Shion… not only the crime show thing,  but files on a bunch of the students here, from all the age groups. I  was there, and you, and Olesa and Amiki, and the Etoiles, obviously,  and Amane, and so many more. It’s seriously creepy. You’re right, she  really is the stalker of Spica.”</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish I could say that I’m surprised. But I don’t think I can. I always suspected that girl, she’s way too weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think you’re just being suspicious,” Momomi said. “You’re the one who’s  jealous of the others, right? You said so in the letter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yeah. But that’s something else entirely. In this, she’s just  suspicious. I mean, she stalks us and takes far too much interest in  us, and she knows far too much about us, too. Plus she has that big  forehead of hers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that got to do with anything?” Momomi asked, giggling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’ve never been able to trust people like that. They’re too smart for  their own good, you know, or they look like that anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you’re practicality a dictionary definition of too smart for your own  good, yourself,” Momomi said. “I’ve always been amazed that you can be  so smart and yet so dumb.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m smart enough to make my own good.  That’s the difference. But with that forehead, for her, it’s something  else. Perhaps it’s the lack of hair covering her over-smart skull,  which makes it look like she’s flaunting her intelligence rather than  keeping it locked away inside like me and other decent honest people.  And because she flaunts it physically, she’ll also like to show off,  and smart people showing off leads to all sorts of difficult things. So  that’s why I don’t trust people with big foreheads.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven’t  fooled me at all,” Momomi teased. “You made that up on the spot, I can  tell, and it was pretty good for something ad libbed, too. But really  your forehead would show if you didn’t have that weird fringe that  comes dangerous close to hiding your eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, I’m aware  that hypocrisy has become a mutually sensitive issue for the two of us,  but there are limits. Your eyes are within a whisker of being subsumed  beneath a wave of brown curls as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “My hair’s naturally straight, in case you haven’t noticed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  my way was more dramatic. A wave of brown straights… what kind of sense  does that make? There needs to be a more natural opposite to the phrase  curls of hair, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t honestly say I’ve ever  given it much thought,” Momomi said. “Then again, that probably goes  for you as well, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When Kaname just gave her a  mock-offended look, Momomi smiled and shrugged. “Well, the semantics of  hair aside, Shion says that she only puts important and interesting  people on her files. I suppose we should be flattered, in a twisted  sort of way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really,” Kaname said, folding her hands behind  her head and looking up at the sky again. “We’re both shoe-ins for  something like that, isn’t it obvious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, even though we’re  smart and all, we don’t exactly do much, now do we?” Momomi said  reasonably. “We just sit around in our room all day and vegetate, and  despite that, we don’t actually do our homework until the last minute  most of the time. Under those circumstances I’m both flattered and  slightly disturbed that she was able to spot what she calls our  potential.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A diamond is a diamond, whether it needs to be cut  or not. It only takes some patience, effort and skill to regrade it  into something exquisite, a burning star on earth, because the  potential’s always there beneath the surface, just waiting for the  right hands to let it out. I suspect Shion fancies herself as the right  hands. And of course, we’re also like diamonds because we have a sharp  cutting edge and are almost unbreakable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say this after we  moped and complained and got petulant and did also sorts of stupid  things as a result of a single row,” Momomi said, smiling. “Wasn’t one  of our lessons for the day the fact that neither of us is invincible?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, but that’s perfect too,” Kaname said, yawning between words.  “That’s to say, the only thing that can scratch a diamond is another  diamond. That’s us, because we can cut each other but no one else can  even touch us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And, like diamonds, we need each other to  regrade ourselves and bring out the shine.” Momomi cocked her head  playfully, glancing at the other girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. Diamonds are  special stones, in a class of their own, even when they’re in rock. But  the original point of the metaphor was diamond and coal. However you  look at it, a diamond is dirty when you’re handed it but it can be made  to shine. But a coal will always be a lump of black dust.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Technically, if coal is subject to sufficient heat and pressure I’m pretty sure it can become a diamond.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s true of people as well. If you push them hard and intensely, you  can make an ordinary person shine. But that takes a lot of effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  metaphors are surprisingly robust,” Momomi mused. “Though that seems to  have more to do with the flexibility of language and wordplay than any  forwards planning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a natural talent of mine,” Kaname said. “One of the facets of a diamond.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smiled at that, imitating her friend’s posture and watching the sky.  But it wasn’t long before she twisted her head to look at Kaname’s face  again, the same as ever. <em>That seems to be the way it works. She’s  the cool one who looks into the distance, and I’m the one who sees her  whole in here and now. It’s a little ironic, I suppose, considering  that’s about the opposite of what we’re like as personalities. </em>She remembered and checked her watch. “We should probably go and have breakfast. Lessons begin in ten minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname made a noncommittal noise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, personally I could care less.” <em>I guess it’s always down to me to say the things that she wants to say for her. I could get used to that. </em>“So we can stay here if you like. What’s the first period of the day here and there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right. Sounds good to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  glad.” Momomi glanced at her friend again, her eyes glittering with  amusement. “It’s only Geography for me, anyway. Nothing important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This school is so casual. I guess that suits me just fine, though. Tell me, though, how many names did Shion have on her list?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About  a hundred, maybe,” Momomi said. “Give or take, I didn’t get to see too  clearly. Mostly from Spica, but with a few from Miator and Lulim.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lulim? There are notables from Lulim? News to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  now, Kaname,” Momomi chided. “Someone has to form the paper aeroplane  club, the puppet society and the cosplay association. They play a vital  role as part of the whole.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, of course,” Kaname replied. “But do you actually know any of their names?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Well… not offhand. But Shion probably does.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  the same, to make a list of around a hundred in a school of around  one-thousand six hundred and twenty is pretty good going,” Kaname said,  closing her eyes. “That’s all of Astraea, of course. But Shion has a  good eye for the important things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course, she may just have an interest in eccentrics.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s true as well,” Kaname conceded. “But I’d rather be eccentric than boring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I can only assume you’re very happy with yourself as you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a slightly suspicious compliment… you do like those.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  and I managed to sneak-peak the password Shion placed on her folder,”  Momomi said. “She really should be more careful. It’s <em>McBain</em>,  which I found somewhat memorable. I’m sure that has a hidden meaning  and I don’t want to know what it is. If she’s stupid enough to use that  for the password she’ll inevitably add to her account, as well, all the  better for us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She might have changed it after you left. I might not like forehead-senpai, but she isn’t stupid. I wouldn’t put it past her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. And of course we’d have to get into her room and onto her  laptop while she wasn’t around, too. It’s more a point of curiosity  than anything we can immediately use.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as crafty as ever, though.I’ll have to remember to be careful around you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course, but you’re just the same. That’s what makes things interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again with the backhand compliments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t intend anything backhanded about that,” Momomi huffed. “I  consider it an untrammelled virtue to be cunning. You’re the one  backhanding me with that comment, only you didn’t bother with the  compliment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure you’ll survive. Your ego’s big enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  I have to compliment you to compensate for your insecurities,” Momomi  said, sighing. “But if we ever need to know anything, Shion’s the one  to go to. Maybe not by hacking her laptop, but by asking her. I’m sure  I could wheedle some juicy things out of her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably. People like her like to show off their knowledge, that’s what makes it fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly,”  Momomi agreed. “Though as you said, she isn’t stupid either. This  reminds me, though… I wonder whether Olesa can hack computers. It seems  to be the kind of thing she’d learn to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,”  Kaname said. “You should ask her at some point. That reminds me,  though. We haven’t set her a task yet, have we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d forgotten again,” Momomi sighed. “We’re way too merciful to that girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me about it. We still owe her with interest for yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think ignoring her could be the most painful retaliation we could offer, though,” Momomi said thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Kaname scowled at the sky. “There’s no need to sink that low. It’s better to be honourable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi quirked her eyebrows. “Sore subject. Very well, honour it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san! Kenjou-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They looked back over their shoulders and saw Serané running towards her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, I’m extremely flattered that we have the Etoiles running after us  so much,” Kaname said. “I’m not sure what we did to deserve that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know the feeling,” Momomi agreed. “Good morning, Etoile-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Serané said, bowing her head briefly. “I take it you two have patched things up, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty much,” Momomi replied. “You didn’t need to make things so scary sounding, either. And apparently Kariya was even worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I was going to apologise for the things she said to Kenjou-san, and  talk to you myself,” Serané said. “But that’s a little unnecessary now,  it seems. I’m glad, though. We were all really worried about your both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All of you? Perhaps you, but you worry about everything,” Kaname observed, closing her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  Kenjou-san,” Serané chided. “All your friends showed their concern in  their different ways. Most of them tend to hide their overt emotions,  though, and were indirect about it. They’re rather like you in that  respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t Kariya-sama the same?” Momomi said. “I know I say that a lot, but it’s true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,  well, half the time or more Kariya says exactly what she means,” Serané  said, smiling. “That’s just who she is, you know. A very strong  personality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven’t exactly answered our question,  though,” Kaname said. “What have we done to set an Etoile doing  something so undignified as to run somewhere?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We managed it,”  Serané said simply. “Kiyashiki-san’s family will arrive on the Friday  and stay over the weekend, leaving on Monday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You what?” Momomi  exclaimed, sitting up and staring at the Etoile. In the pain of losing  Kaname and the euphoria of getting her back, she’d rather forgotten  about the fact that they might be separated forever. <em>Just like Shion and Isae…no. I’m different, I’ll fight. I definitely won’t let happen to us.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s confirmed,” Serané said, her tone serious. “However, we have to talk about that. There’s many than one dimension to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, the day’s first lesson is about to start,” Kaname said, sitting  up. “I don’t actually care but I’m throwing it out anyway by way of  making conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll bear full responsibility. This is  important business for us, as well.” She swept away, an anxious Momomi  hot on her heels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And why do you take so much interest in us?” Kaname asked, running to catch up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  mean you haven’t worked it out?” Serané asked, smiling teasingly. “I’m  surprised, considering you’re so intelligent, Kenjou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, tell me already. You two are utterly ineffable anyway, so I won’t even try to understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  the duty of the Etoiles to look after all the students at this school,”  Serané said. “But when Kariya and I became Etoiles, we agreed that we’d  have a few priorities. Problem students were high on that list.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  mean you pay so much attention to us because we’re difficult cases or  something?” Kaname rolled her eyes. “That’s just great.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better than being boring, isn’t it?” Momomi imitated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  laughed in a ladylike way, putting her hand over her mouth. “This is  how things should be with you two, you know. It’s very cute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s seriously patronising,” Kaname complained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it? I’m sorry, but I couldn’t help myself. You both remind me of Kariya and myself when were younger, to some degree.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi and Kaname exchanged a horrified look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only a little, though,” Serané said. “Even in our worst days, we were a little more forthright, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  snorted. “For once, you might be the dishonest one, right now. Somehow  I can see you in your younger days, and you’re very haughty. I wonder  how accurate I’m being.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps you’re right. I’m looking back,  after all, which always warps someone’s perspective. Another difference  was that we always used to meet in the clock tower. Well, we still do  from time to time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh? What are you mumbling about now?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, your special place is the bank by the lake, right?” Serané said, smiling. “That’s a romantic setting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?  No! Now you’re just talking like Amiki!” Kaname scowled, putting her  hands in her pockets again. “We just meet there because it’s out of the  way of other people, who are really annoying. And we didn’t even mean  to go there today, not to meet, but we both kinda did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  put a hand over her left eye, sighing deeply before Serané could reply.  “Those are two of the qualifications for a romantic spot, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  just teasing you both,” Serané said sweetly. “I don’t mean to imply  anything offensive, and if I did, I apologise. One becomes accustomed  to a casual attitude to romance in this school, which may not always be  appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not like I’m offended or anything,” Kaname said, disarmed by her seriousness. “I was just a little annoyed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s how I knew where to find you. It was an educated guess. But I’ve had a very busy morning, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Kaname said, disinterest plain on her voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, first of all, I was looking for you,” Serané continued. “But you weren’t in your room, even that early in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s head snapped round. “You went in my room?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right,” Serané said. “It was a bit messy, though, Kenjou-san, you  should clean it up more often. There were a lot of screwed up pieces of  paper all over the floor. That’s not good practise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the  hell?” Momomi asked. “I leave for one evening and that happens? You  really are hopeless, Kaname… or do you have something to hide?” She  grinned at her blushing friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just hope you didn’t read any of my stuff,” Kaname managed, her voice rigid. “I hate people who behave badly like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I wouldn’t read letters in a bin without a very good reason, I can assure you of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Letters?” Kaname enquired dangerously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Letters,  Kenjou-san, or similar things that emotionally distressed girls write,”  Serané said. “I understand these things perfectly, having gone through  the same process a few times myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was not emotionally distressed! I was just really irritable… I’m not like Momomi, crying over every little thing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  laughed and put a hand over her lips again, smiling brilliantly. “You  really haven’t been changed at all by this experience, Kenjou-san. I’m  not sure whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,” Momomi closed her eyes, frowning. “So-so,” she pronounced eventually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that what you’re supposed to say?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  said I should be honest, and not mislead you any more,” Momomi said,  smiling. “Or something like that. It’s better that you know my true  feelings, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to learn to be careful what I wish  for over these coming weeks,” Kaname said, her face twisting into a  sour expression. “I can tell that already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, as  entertaining as you both are, we had better move faster. Even if we’re  missing part of the first period to have this informal briefing, we  don’t intend to skip any more than necessary. And Kariya’s waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,  so the latter bit’s a little scary,” Momomi said thoughtfully. She  remembered something. “Does she really have a katana in her room?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  afraid so. But that’s another reason to be careful, no?” She hitched up  her long black skirt and broke into a run again, forcing the Spicans to  run to catch up with her. However fit or otherwise the Etoile was, she  had a significant height advantage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do we have to go this far? Isn’t it pretty undignified for you?” Kaname observed, frowning at a struggling Momomi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, most people should be in their first lessons by now. But dignity is a matter of poise, not action.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah…  right…” Momomi looked sidelong at the Etoile, noting how she managed a  certain effortless grace even when she was running. <em>It’s probably  the skirt, which for the most part hides her legs and makes her look  more like a black cloud than a running girl. I’m not sure whether  that’s an improvement… and it has to be tiring, moving around with that  sheer volume of material.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Believe in yourself implicitly,  believe in your words and actions and everything you do, and show that  by giving it your all,” Serané said. “That’s what Kariya says. That way  you’ll always be dignified.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s way too easy for her to  say,” Kaname said, ducking into the dorms after the Etoile and  following her. “Kariya-sama is a naturally graceful person, as much as  I hate to admit it. It’s just like her ego to mistake a born talent for  something that just anyone can imitate if they try hard enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  truth’s somewhat in-between those two extremes, I think. I do think  that grace is a state of mind… but it’s not something you can just  adopt. Don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, something like that,” Kaname conceded. “Not that it matters anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané slowed to a walk, ending in front of a door Momomi didn’t know. “We’re here,” she said, opening it without knocking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re late, Shizuru,” Kariya said severely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,  Kari-chan,” Serané replied. “I was just so caught up talking to these  two… they’ve made up, you see, I’m very happy for them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  sighed and adopted a tired expression, running a hand through her red  hair. “This is why I hate teenagers. They have one little row and God  has died, the devil has come to earth and everything’s black… angst,  angst, angst. And when they actually get round to talking to each other  again, the sun’s instantly shining and all’s right with the world  again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t angst!” Kaname protested hotly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, not me, anyway,” Momomi said. “I don’t know about her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, yeah? Am I the one who cried?” Kaname said, turning on her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, but you wrote a lot of cringeworthy letters,” Kariya said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you did read them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Letters?  More than one? Can I see?” Momomi giggled. “It’s a little cruel, but  I’m sure they’ll be hilarious with the benefit for hindsight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  now. We used to be young, as well, Kari-chan, we were both the same.”  Serané closed the door behind her and stepped forwards into the centre  of the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did not angst,” Kariya said, folding her arms. “I  was never that stupid. I had a few legitimate doubts, but I did  something about them. I never got all angsty and useless like some  people I could mention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose I wasn’t that important to  you,” Serané said, sighing theatrically. “Woe is me…” Kariya looked  baffled for a moment before Serané leaned forwards and kissed her on  the cheek. “We were discussing this, actually. Kari-chan is a little  dishonest too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you still like playing around with words,” Kariya said. “Sit down, you two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat down, trying not to blush. <em>It  seems strange when I actually think about it, but I can’t remember the  last time they publicly displayed their affection, even though it’s  common knowledge that they’re lovers. I guess that wouldn’t be genteel,  but this is their room and their world. We’re the intruders. Makes me  feel a little uncomfortable. </em>She looked around to distract  herself. It was notably larger than her own, with two beds pushed  together on one side and a clear space on the other, filled with two  sofas opposite each other, a coffee table in between them. She was  sitting there now. <em>And I damn well wish I had something this cushy. The privileges of office. </em>There were several large bookshelves, a large writing desk and a dresser. A daishō pair was mounted on the wall above the desk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you really, really do have swords here,” Momomi noted. “Is that even legal?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  licensed for them, and I obtained permission from the Superior,” Kariya  said. “You shouldn’t consider me a common criminal, Kiyashiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  gratuitous,” Kaname muttered. “When are you ever going to have those on  you to be of use? And this is an age of guns, if you’re going to invest  in weapons, get those, not showpieces.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My guns are at home. They have less symbolism attached to them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,  what do you think, apart from Kari-chan’s little hobby?” Serané asked  politely. “We’ve tried our best to make it a comfortable space.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  impressive.” Momomi looked around again, noting the pictures of  Serané’s family placed in little alcoves, her manga collection, a  desktop computer and a widescreen television. “But with this kind of  space, and these kind of resources, I should hope so too. We don’t get  half as much room, let alone a TV.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It comes with the  territory,” Kariya said. “One of the better parts of the job. If you’re  jealous, work hard and become Etoile when you have the chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’ll be sure to bear that in mind,” Kaname muttered sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s also a bathroom behind that door, which includes a large bath,” Serané said. “That’s very nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  don’t think those things. Bad mental images. I must have a dirty mind,  actually, though I hate to admit it. Or perhaps it’s because I’m not  stupid. </em>“I’m jealous again,” Momomi said to cover herself. “We don’t get anything be a shower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you should have a bath by your fourth year at the latest, that’s not a  prerogative of the Etoiles. Before, I’m told, everyone had baths in  their rooms. But when Lulim was founded the dorms had to be expanded,  and of course they cut some corners to cut some costs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that  school’s being troublesome again,” Kaname muttered. “Shouldn’t they get  all the new rooms, and leave us with the better old ones?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, with that logic, Miator gets all the Strawberry Dorms,” Kariya replied. “We were the founders, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? So you were there in person, were you?” Kaname retorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case,” Serané said, raising her hands. “As pleasant as it is to  chat, we’d better get on. We’re honour-bound to return you to your  lessons as soon as possible, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But this is an  important business.” Kariya turned fierce eyes on them. “So take it  seriously. If you don’t, I’ll make you wish you had. And if you screw  this up for us, I’ll kill you and be done with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not going to create a good atmosphere, Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Kariya said, leaning back and folding her arms. “But all the  same, I don’t like these pipsqueaks being here at all. If they get in  your way, I won’t forgive them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Skip to the punchline already,” Kaname said. “I’m getting tired here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  broadly,” Serané said, pausing and taking a breath. She leaned forwards  slightly, interlacing her fingers. “We received a phone call this  morning, from the Superior’s office. And that confirmed that  Kiyashiki-san’s family would be visiting from Friday to Monday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We know that,” Kaname said. Kariya gave her a warning look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“However… Kiyashiki’s departure is not the only thing on their minds when they’re coming here,” Serané said, smiling nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  would be safe to say that it’s only a minor matter, compared to the  main thing,” Kariya said cynically. “Isn’t that right, Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  correct, I suppose.” Her clasped hands twisted slightly. “The principle  motive for their visit is rather more to do with me… that’s to say…  something I used as a reason for them to visit, which benefits you, but  also me in a way…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just stared. <em>It’s not like her to lose her pristine mask. This had better be interesting.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  that… well, we live in a small world, Momomi-chan, and we’re all  connected,” Serané said, smiling awkwardly. “And one of those  connections… a coincidence, really, but nonetheless… that is…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I?” Kariya asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please,” Serané said in a very small voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané  will be meeting your cousin, Araldo Phareli, as well as your father,  about an arranged marriage between them,” Kariya said, closing her  eyes. “That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my, Kiyashiki-san,  don’t sound so surprised,” Serané said, smiling faintly. “It’s  inevitable for my family to arrange a marriage for me. In an  increasingly narrow world of legitimate aristocrats, the odds are not  substantially against this kind of coincidence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not that. How can you be so calm? What are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Obstruct  the arrangement, of course,” Serané said, closing her eyes and sighing.  “Even if I were to follow my family’s will, it’s impossible for someone  like me to be a good wife to your cousin. I’ve told my parents this,  but they refuse to acknowledge it. So I will just have to convince  Araldo-san that he does not want to marry me, and your father that I am  not suitable for his nephew.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you taking this a bit too  seriously?” Kaname said sourly. “All you have to do is refuse, and tell  them you won’t follow through with it. That’s the proper thing to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru’s not like you,” Kariya said haughtily. “She’s fond of her family, even if they aren’t good at listening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s pretty clear they’re taking her for granted, if they aren’t giving her a choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not a matter of malice,” Serané said quietly. “They just think they  know what’s best for me, and they want me to be happy. I can accept the  sentiment, if not the method they are using.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged  thoughtfully. “It’s a point, though. You know that even if my cousin  rejects you, your parents will keep finding candidates. They’re going  to get more obstinate, not less, as you get through them. And  eventually you’ll meet one equally determined to follow through… it’s  better to finish it now, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s probably true,” Serané  conceded. “But all the same, I don’t think I can do that. As time  passes, my parents will begin to understand more, or so I hope.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  scowled. “In any case, we’re not discussing this with you. This is  Shizuru’s problem, and to some degree mine as well, but not yours.  We’re just notifying you of the situation, but you’re not expected to  intervene.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could have said that in a more reasonable way, Kariya,” Serané said softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry. But it’s best to say it anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that suits me just fine.” Momomi shrugged. “It’s one thing less for me  to worry about, when I have plenty to fret about as it is. You two can  handle yourselves, I know that much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rather better than you can,” Kariya agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But the problem is… it’s not quite not our problem,” Kaname said thoughtfully. “Possibly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  principle thing is that Serané-sama’s relying on creating a negative  impression to your parents, as a person,” Kaname pointed out. “That way  she’ll be judged as an unsuitable bride. She has to come across as  someone with many flaws. On the other hand, we’re trying to portray  this school in a positive light, and as the Etoile Serané’s got a lot  to do with the school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,” Momomi said, turning this over in her head. “This is a complication.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  that thing… the book with the fighter planes, no, the bombers,” Kaname  mumbled. “Where everything goes round and round in circles, which is  pretty stupid, because bombers tend to go straight down after a while.  It would be a horribly inefficient enemy who failed to kill one bomber.  Probably to compensate for all that paper.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya put her head in her hands. “What the hell?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Catch 22,” Serané said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right,” Kaname nodded. “A stupid book, but the point stands. Like this,  the enemy isn’t the main worry, but the other people on our side.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve  been studying it in English,” Momomi explained to a disgruntled Kariya.  “Though it would seem that Kaname’s been struggling somewhat…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can see that,” Kariya sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  bad English aside… Kenjou-kun is quite right,” Serané said, her hands  still again. “There’s a certain degree of conflict between our  objectives. All the same, we should probably co-operate as far as  possible. If I focus my efforts on Araldo-san, I should not  substantially inconvenience you with your father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And as for  that bastard, I’ll be the one dealing with him for the most part,”  Kariya said. “If he can’t come to know Shizuru he won’t come to like  her, or so we figure, anyway. I’ll impress him about this school  without her impressing him as a person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… are you sure that’s a good idea?” Momomi mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you implying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh… how do I say this… my father might not approve of someone with your firm and forthright personality, Kariya-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really?” Kariya snorted. “Well, let him disapprove all he likes, he’ll  just have to lump it. I have a duty, but that’s not for me to coddle  him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only your duty is to coddle him, Kari-chan,” Serané reminded gently. “Or, rather, that’s what Kiyashiki-san wants from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. How very annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is why it’s inconvenient for me,” Momomi said, looking bemused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry, Kari-chan can be quite graceful when she really needs to,”  Serané said. “She just has to put her mind to it. And if she comes  across in an especially positive light, it’s the better for me, because  then I’ll look weak in comparison.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya closed her eyes for a  moment. “I don’t think even on my top form I’ll be able to do anything  but emphasise you. Grace is your thing, Shizuru, I don’t like to have  to pretend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, please try your best, Kari-chan,” Serané said. “For me, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blonde sighed. “But all the same, I appreciate this will be  complicated. We have a limited timeframe and two quite different  objectives. I’m sorry for dragging my own business into this, but it  was necessary to get your parents to come.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I’ll probably get in your way in turn,” Momomi replied. “We had better be a little careful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  leaned back and looked at the ceiling, yawning. “Well, it’s fine, isn’t  it? We just have to do everything and see to everything, send this boy  packing and keep Momomi here both. It could be worse, but it’s fine  either way. In both cases we’re screwing over the arrogance of  aristocrats which I hate, so we just go for total victory.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her obnoxious attitude aside, I’m inclined to agree,” Kariya said. “There’s no need to compromise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right.” Momomi smiled. “We’ll do it like that, total victory.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little presumptuous from us, I think, but all the same…” Serané smiled wanly. “Total victory it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  the right attitude,” Kaname muttered. “It’s like going into a fight. No  one ever won by going in half-heartedly. But if you come at your enemy  with everything you have, because you have to win, with an attitude  like that, you’re already at an advantage. They probably lack that  attitude, and having it makes you strong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true enough,” Kariya said. “That’s true enough. But you should be in your first lessons now, so shove off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Goddamnit.” Kaname sighed, rubbing her eyes distractedly. “I had the next part of my spiel all worked out, too. Do I have to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. Shove off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good day, Kiyashiki-san, Kenjou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nice try, but never mind,” Momomi sighed, helping Kaname up. “Looks like we’d better go.”</span></p>
