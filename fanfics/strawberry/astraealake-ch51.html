<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now Momomi is being troublingly introspective. Someone should tell these two to stop thinking so much...</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Momomi stepped into the stables, and was surprised to see Amane waiting there. “Good morning.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning.” Amane glanced at her. “You’re late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry. I got caught up in something on the way here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. With Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty  much,” Momomi replied, shrugging off her blazer and swapping it for a  riding jacket. “But not so much a row this time. Just me making sure  she isn’t being too stupid, pretty much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane closed her eyes for a moment, pulling something out of her jacket pocket. A long red ribbon. “Use this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s better than using your necktie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. I see.” Momomi blinked. “Is this a present, or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  but not from me.” Amane looked distracted for a moment. “It was a first  year’s idea… what’s her name… mousy brown hair, glasses… in any case,  she saw you yesterday, and gave me this in the evening, to give to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi took the ribbon, frowning at it. “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure. Probably to get me to accept a present, even indirectly.”  Amane frowned. “She’s smart and bold, that one.” She sounded vaguely  offended by those facts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gave her a cunning look. “Do you like her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shook her head, then went to ease Starbright out of his stall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi opened her own door and lead out Sol, who had already been prepared. “Do you get a lot of presents, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That must be pretty good. I wish I got random people to give me presents… now that’s what I call a talent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s annoying. I can’t accept any of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  you can’t show any interest in them? That’s so harsh.” Momomi frowned.  “Couldn’t you at least feign one, every once in a while? Hope’s a  wonderful thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scratched her cheek. “Is that my job? You can tell me, I won’t be offended.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm…”  Momomi shrugged, trying her hair up with the ribbon. “But that girl  must be pretty smart, if she saw me, found this and gave it to you all  in one day. That’s some serious dedication. You have amazing fans.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly seems fair, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I don’t understand them at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  Momomi could reply, the blue-haired girl mounted her horse and rode  out. Momomi sighed and followed, keeping a careful grip on Sol’s  reigns. Even if she could manage trotting around, she wouldn’t like to  go faster than that. Forget the jumps Amane practised…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How was Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked up. <em>She’s surprisingly talkative today. </em>“She  skipped breakfast. That was irresponsible of her. Apparently, she took  a walk in the morning and lost track of time. I’m not sure whether I’m  supposed to believe that or not, but it’s fine, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  was a little pale, actually. And of course she has to skip the chance  to eat now, thanks to her damn stubbornness… there’s no helping that  girl sometimes, you know? It’s very frustrating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh, come on. You’re the one who brought it up! </em>“Well, it can’t be helped. Kaname is Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And how are things between you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “She’s still… well, she isn’t happy that I’m spending time with you, still. She’s very possessive like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That must be troublesome for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is, I suppose.” Momomi sighed. “But like I said to her, at least I know she cares.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if that’s only as a friend, that’s better than nothing, I suppose. I should thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No need,” Amane replied vaguely. “Anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi decided not to mention Kaname’s little theory. <em>That would just embarrass me. </em>“She  was being Kaname, basically. It’s not like there’s been any permanent  damage to our relationship, so you don’t have to worry, if that’s what  it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked around, noting that there were  a few more people watching than yesterday. It was strange for her, to  be watched like that, but she could pull it off. She was a Phareli,  after all. While there were times when she hated that fact, it did mean  she’d become accustomed to the fact that the world could- perhaps  should- revolve around her. <em>All those maids, after all. I’m sure  they’re present for the sense of power and control they bring as much  as their actual services. Maybe I’m wrong. </em>Momomi sighed,  remembering what Shion had set her to do and working out how to go  about it. “But you know, my days are suddenly very timetabled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see you in the mornings, lessons, you again, lessons, then at lunchtime  I go off with Kaname and study for the scholarship exams.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, with my parents… things are awkward, to say the least. But you probably know that already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  far as I’m concerned, I don’t want to depend on them at all. But such  grand things aren’t possible for a girl as young as me, now are they?”  Momomi shrugged. “So I just do what I can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What would you do for university, like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shifted uncomfortably. “I’m not sure, really. I guess I’d have to work as much as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Reconciliation would be useful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Useful,  perhaps. I’m not sure about possible. My father, and I… our personal  differences are pretty huge.” Momomi frowned. “Well, it’s not like you  want to hear about this. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t burden you with my  problems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine,” Amane replied loosely. “I may end up like that eventually, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Well, I suppose so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, even then, my father would not enjoy hating me. Even if that became necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like to think that about <em>him</em>,  but sometimes it’s hard to tell.” Momomi glanced at the other rider,  deciding she’d given enough away for now. “So, how about you? What’s  your relationship with your parents like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged. “Reasonable. Better with my mother. To the head of the family, I am sufficient for my role. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You? Merely sufficient? You must have hellish standards in your family…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  in any case… I’ve lost my thread. That’s right. And then I have  lessons, and after that I go clean the Church with Kaname, Amiki and  Olesa. Our punishment, you see. After that, Kaname goes and hits people  with wooden swords or whatever it is they do in kendo, and I have to  translate Shakespeare into Japanese. Oh, and did I mention I’m working  with Olesa, who argues with me on about every single point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane obligingly raised her eyebrows slightly. “Shakespeare? Is that another punishment?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled, but only a little. As ever, Amane had been completely deadpan. <em>You  can tell why Olesa and her get on so well. They probably practise their  poker faces together. Actually, they probably practise playing poker  together…</em>”Not exactly,” she managed. “We set to work by Shion…  Tomori-senpai. She wants us to translate Twelfth Night for a Spica  lower school performance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane gave her a cautious look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As ever, she’s smart. </em>“But honestly, it’s a bother. I barely have any time for homework any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you accept?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Payment for services rendered. </em>“Well, even if I’m moaning, the project is interesting. And she is a friend of mine, so I’m doing her a favour, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  still find it… ironic, that neither of the two translators are actually  native-born Japanese speakers. Well, my mother taught me, but it’s not  like I ever used it much. And with Olesa, well, I don’t even know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re both linguistically exceptional. It makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I wouldn’t go that far… but you would know about Olesa, wouldn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “She’s talked about it. A little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What did she say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  curious. Oh, well. It’s not important.” Momomi looked at their audience  again. “But I’m not sure whether or not to be glad that she’s helping  me. I’m sure we don’t even save time because we argue over every point,  but I suppose that makes for a better final product. I never knew how  hard this interpretation stuff was until I tried it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked and looked back, giving Amane a puzzled look. “Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t understand. Why Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In what sense?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you like Kenjou? Out of everything I’ve heard about you, it’s the one thing I don’t understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s a pretty general question, isn’t it?” Momomi smiled wistfully.  “It’s not like I even know myself, you know. I didn’t exactly choose to  fall in love with my best friend…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Amane frowned. “As I’d expected, love is a difficult concept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, love’s a strong word,” Momomi murmured. “This might be a crush or something, I don’t really know what each feels like…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not the point. Kenjou is… I don’t know.” Amane frowned. “I do not understand Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t understand a lot of things, apparently,” Momomi remarked lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  looked around the paddock thoughtfully. “Of course. But while Kenjou  may be an interesting person, her outwards posture is hostile to all,  so very few people ever know what she is like. In that sense, I find  it… strange, that she should find my own isolationistic mindset so  offensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you’re over-analysing these things. Kaname’s  attitude to you, and my feelings for her. Neither of them are things  you need to worry about or take too seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Together they have quite the impact on your behaviour, and hers,” Amane observed. “So I’d like to understand, if nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  why I like Kaname… I’m not sure where to start, really.” Momomi spotted  her friend, leaning against a tree in the distance, but that short blue  hair was unmistakable. “Well, that’s one thing, I suppose. She’s always  so guarded, always trying to be so cool, so that if you can see through  her attitudes and pouts it’s actually really endearing. When she’s  leaning against the tree and folding her arms like that, it actually  shows her vulnerability. Even someone like her has that side of her,  and she’s more sensitive than most in many things. But she doesn’t want  to show that. She’s… complex.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I’m not sure I follow. But perhaps that’s the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yeah. That was kinda embarrassing.” Momomi smiled slightly. “It’s not  something to think too much about. It’s just her qualities that make  her good to me or for me, not necessarily a good person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “You are strange people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Didn’t we have that conversation yesterday, as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi waved at Kaname, smirking as the girl turned away. <em>She probably doesn’t even want me to catch her looking at me. </em>“Well, I like her. Even if it’s a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are your intentions with her? Do you still have hopes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really. That would just be foolish. I don’t went to press and wreak our  friendship, or hope and wreak my nerves. This is the way things are.”  Momomi shrugged. “I’m mature enough to deal with the hand I’m dealt  with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi winced. “Well, yeah, but its  not intentionally to make her jealous. I just need to leave a little  space, and also… well… teach her that I can’t be with her <em>all </em>the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You wonder what?” Momomi challenged. “There’s nothing to wonder about, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it was just for that, anyone would do. I’m someone who would naturally  incense Kenjou and make her jealous. That’s why you’re using me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  frowned. “Well, you’re useful for other things too, you know. Your  popularity, for a start. Besides, you’re also a little interesting in  your own right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane made a noise that might have been a chuckle. “That’s not why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sound very certain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am certain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “You are someone who is too proud and independent, and too interested in Kaname. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You make me sound very scrupulous and obsessive. I’m a little more than those stereotypes, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged. “Regardless. Consciously or not, I do not think that you accept things as you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s fine,” Momomi replied. Her cheeks were flushing slightly, so she shook herself. “But I disagree with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s the case, what would you do, if another girl approached you romantically?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. <em>Damn, she really is different from before. I suppose she thinks she’s entitled to this messed-up psychoanalysis. </em>“Well, that would depend, wouldn’t it?” she replied. “There isn’t anyone else I’m interested in, right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. But if there was?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged. “Well, it’d feel a little… inappropriate, to go out with  another girl this recently. I mean, I confessed to Kaname a few days  ago. As she’d put it, that’d make me very fickle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps, but  if your feelings are there, isn’t that something she should accept?”  Amane frowned. “I’ve never understood why being fickle is a weakness.  Certainly, under these circumstances, they’re a strength.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well, that doesn’t mean it’s something I can accept.” Momomi shifted  uncomfortably. “I guess I don’t understand because I’m not in that  situation, but it’s rather hard for me to imagine right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane glanced at her. “Wouldn’t it be useful, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Useful?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s more jealous. You also prove your point and even gain some release from your difficulties.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. “Are you coming onto me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  glanced at her. “I’m toying with you, and seeing if anything  interesting happens.” She blinked slowly and looked away. “That is how  you would reply to such a question, is it not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared for a moment, then shrugged and turned away. “Mainly to save my own ego, you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven’t responded, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  even if you’re logically accurate, this isn’t something I can think  about in those terms. If it was someone else, maybe, but this is  Kaname… I swore long ago. I wouldn’t manipulate Kaname.” Momomi  chuckled. “Unless it was really very necessary for me to do so, that  is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi cocked her head. “Why all the questions, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane gave her an impassive look. “Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed loudly, rolling her eyes. “If you say so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Impaired judgement is a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  glanced at Kaname. “People make mistakes. Pride in its extreme means  you do not admit to a mistake, and can be effective in that. But still,  if Kenjou was wrong or if her feelings changed, her judgement would  likely be impaired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that, I doubt even she’d screw up over this. It’s important, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a complex matter.” Amane glanced at her. “How long did it take for you to realise your feelings?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shifted. “You make it sound like they were there all along, but I don’t  believe in that. They grew in me, and I grew into them… probably. I  don’t believe in love at first sight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “But by that same token, Kenjou may well grow into her feelings after you. That’s a possibility, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s hardly likely. She’s not even gay, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So she says. People are not honest. How about her jealousy and possessiveness? Isn’t that a sign in itself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  of her idea of friendship.” Momomi folded her arms impatiently. “But  none of that means she likes me after all. The world isn’t that  convenient, and it just isn’t likely. I’m not going to hurt myself  getting my hopes up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That, too, is impaired judgement.” Amane  reigned in Starbright, halting the horse, and looked at Momomi with  challenging eyes. “You fear disappointment, so you do not consider the  possibility of a positive outcome at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn! She’s been leading me again, hasn’t she? Why does it always end like this? </em>Momomi  pouted. “Well, sorry to disappoint you, but just considering it doesn’t  make it true. Whether I hope or not, she won’t like me as anything but  a friend. Isn’t that settled already? Hanging around and praying that  her feelings will change would make me a very fake friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A true friend should also be ready for the possibility that her feelings might change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am ready! That would be wonderful. But it won’t happen, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  nodded. “You had better get going again.” But this time she placed a  hand on Sol’s bridle before Momomi could turn the horse away. Momomi  blinked as Amane leant forwards, bringing herself next to her ear. Her  next words were whispered softly. <em>“Please consider the value of hope.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  eyes widened slightly. Then Amane turned and kissed her briefly on the  cheek. She blushed furiously. “What the hell are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “Isn’t that obvious?” She turned Starbright around and headed for the stables.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rode after her. “Isn’t that obvious? What kind of answer is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damnit. Don’t do that again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because… well, I mean, why do it? You still haven’t me what the hell you’re playing at!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “Just wondering. You’ve given up on Kenjou, have you not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “That doesn’t mean I want to go out with you, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane dismounted and lead Starbright into the stables. “That wasn’t my intention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then what the hell was your intention?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you are overreacting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who the hell is overreacting?” Momomi demanded. “You just kissed me, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the cheek.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So? What are people supposed to think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged, helping Starbright into his stall and patting him gently on the neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi growled, sliding off her force. “Well, even if you don’t care, I do! What did you do that for?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced at her. “To see how you would react.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  blue haired girl turned and stepped towards her, regarding her with  intense eyes. Momomi instinctively stepped back, her back hitting the  stable wall. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stepped forwards again,  placing one of her hands on the wall next to Momomi’s head. She moved  closer still, staring into Momomi’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s mind entered  terminal panic and then reacted. Somehow, her hand travelling to slap  Amane changed into a fist, hitting the girl square on the right cheek. <em>Too much time spent with Kaname… </em>“Get away from me, damnit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stepped back, touching a hand against her bruised cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then she laughed. “You’re very interesting, Phareli-san. I’m sure I’ve mentioned that to you before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared back at a Amane who was plainly very amused. <em>This is the most emotional and intense I’ve ever seen her…</em>”You’re nuts,” she replied bluntly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged and smiled. “Perhaps. But that means I’m not an easy person to deal with, which befits me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is this your idea of revenge?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If my feelings were sincere, that would be very insulting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They didn’t <em>feel </em>sincere. Not least because I can’t imagine you falling for someone anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed. “If you say so. In any case, you react in interesting ways.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried to calm herself now. <em>This is a game to her, you’ve been played. So at least retain some dignity. </em>“You mean the hitting you thing? Or the rejecting you thing? I can’t imagine you’re very used to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The former. You’re in love with Kaname, after all.” Amane narrowed her eyes. “You haven’t given up, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t state speculation about me as if it’s fact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane unbuttoned her riding jacket and carried on with her routine as if nothing happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you so calm?” Momomi demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m a calm person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “Why are you a calm person?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because not much panics me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. I give up. You’re just plain weird, you do know that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So are you.” Amane shrugged her blazer on. “In any case, you can end our association if you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow, I think that’d just be playing into your hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does that bother you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course.” Momomi folded her arms. “In any case, if you’d wanted to be  rid of me, it would take a lot more than that. Nice try, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  turned to hide what might have been a smile. “If that’s the case, you’d  do well to go and assure Kenjou of the state of affairs. She may have  been surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. <em>Oh, god. I forgot about that. Now there’s a potentially awkward encounter…</em>”Was that your aim?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I going to tell you either way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably not. You’re annoying like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “We’re running late. You should go to your lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted and began to take off her riding jacket, watching as Amane walked out. <em>Arrogant  bitch…I wish she’d stop playing around, because this’ll mean hell for  me. I’ll give her something, though. She’s dangerously good at  surprising me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi was about to step outside the barn when she was abruptly hit by a vision of the future. <em>Damn.  I’d forgotten about the fangirls…well, Amane’s probably distracting  them. I’ll need to move fast, though. I can’t deal with that right now. </em>She turned and slipped out the back into the paddock again,  clambering between the fence and quickly running for the forest. She  managed to conceal herself behind a tree before she stopped and tried  to work out what her next move was. <em>Yeah, popularity is a good  principle, but parts of it are inconvenient. This is one of them. I’m  going to be unbelievably late for my next lesson. Imai-sensei will not  be happy…I’d probably be even more late if I took the direct approach,  though. I’ll have to take to the forest and loop round for a bit before  heading for the school. Well, it’s not like I’ll get lost. I know this  forest way too well by now. </em>Momomi took off, jogging through the trees and breathing heavily. Her schoolbag bounced repeatedly against her leg. <em>Out  of breath already…as Kaname says so often, I’m really unfit. Perhaps I  should take up a sport. Not right now, though. I don’t have the time,  what with one thing and another. More importantly, though, Kaname is  going to be so mad with me. Probably. When I actually think of it, she  doesn’t have too much right to be mad with me. But she will be anyway,  she’s that kind of friend. It’s going to be awkward in lunchtime, but  at least we have to talk then. It’ll give me a chance. </em>Momomi  scowled, hair flying out behind her. She noticed she was still wearing  the ribbon, so she slid to a halt and pulled it out, shaking her out  long brown hair. <em>Why’s it a matter of a chance, though? I don’t  have anything to apologise for, everything that did happen is Amane’s  fault. I wish I could believe that Kaname will remember that, but  there’s no guarantee. This is Kaname we’re talking about. Why did Amane  have to complicate things?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rounded a tree and set a course for the school. For once, she agreed with Kaname and wished for trousers. <em>So  much more practical when you’re wading through the more crowded and,  well, brambly parts of a forest. But the Amane question is a damn good  one, as she definitely gave me anything but a straight answer. She  always has to be so damned awkward. </em>Momomi sighed. <em>I doubt I’d  have gotten so involved with her if I realised how much trouble she’d  be. She’s far too smart, scarily perceptive and doesn’t mind acting in  eccentric ways to score points or achieve whatever her weird goals are.  Not that I knew that before I started all this, of course. But it was  Olesa’s recommendation…</em>Momomi bit her lip. <em>Olesa who should, no,  would know both those facts and a whole lot more. Olesa who talks about  me and could, perhaps, feed information and plans to Amane when they’re  innocently horse riding. Olesa who, even as my friend, doesn’t mind  messing me around on moral grounds. Well, it’d explain Amane’s damned  insights a little. Am I being over-suspicious? Paranoid, even? Or am I  just realistic? It’s hard to tell with Olesa, she’s enigmatic at the  best of times. Just like Amane. No wonder they get on so well. But  still, its not like I can just go and ask her. She’d just deny  everything, so unless I start spying on them- nah, I’m not that  desperate. It’s not important, just vaguely annoying.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  stopped for a moment, trying to catch her breath. Now she was close to  the school, so she had to slow to a dignified walk. It wouldn’t do to  be seen running, unless it was by a teacher. <em>On that note, I need  to come up with a decent excuse. Let’s see…I ended up leaving my bag in  my room before I went horse riding, and then I spent too much time  talking to Amane. Well, witnesses will probably testify to </em>that<em>. And then I had to go all the way to the dorms to fetch my bag…eh, I’ll still get into trouble, but at least it’s something. </em>Momomi  walked through the gates of the school and sped up slightly, hurrying  through the corridors and ignoring the curious glances she attracted  from a few older students. <em>Hopefully they either don’t know or  don’t care. After all, the matters of the lower school students are  below them, right? Unless they are the Etoiles, who not only make other  students’ business their business, but then smile and claim that’s  their duty, whether they like it or not. Sort of officially sanctioned  busybodies, more or less. Oh, god… yeah, no doubt Serané will turn up  later, speaking very prettily. And she’ll probe and extract  explanations and so on. Yeah, Amane has definitely filled my day with  even more needless complexity and trouble. Which is pretty hypocritical  of her, when she complains so much about how other people and  socialising are a bother. But she’s like that. Like Kaname, someone who  has her cake and eats it. Well, as if I’m any different…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  she reached her classroom, opening the door and bowing her head in  apology. A few muttered words later and she took her usual seat,  sighing when it became plain that news had already spread. She was  receiving a lot of glances, some bemused, some curious and some  outright hostile. Of course, there were also the ones who didn’t care  either way, and made that very clear. Half of them faking, half of them  sincere in their indifference. <em>I wish there was a way for me to join that fraction. Under the circumstances, though, that’s probably impossible. </em>Momomi  pulled out her textbook and flipped to the relevant pages, reading fast  and attempting to catch up on what she’d missed. She had to be a good  student now, after all, even if it was a bother. <em>Besides, if I concentrate on my work, I won’t have to think about what happened…shoot. </em>She sighed. <em>On  the other hand, I need to have this all worked out before I meet up  with Kaname in lunchtime. Or what I’m going to say, at least. Sorry,  Geography. It looks like you’re going to have to be sacrificed for the  cause after all. I really shouldn’t be glad that a lot of my teachers  have given me up as a lost cause, but, well, sometimes it’s pretty  useful. </em>She pretended to pay attention, letting her mind wheel freely through what had happened. <em>Well,  I kinda know what happened. The problem is why. It’s possible Amane has  sincere feelings for me and was just acting tough, in which case I was  being rather cruel. I really, seriously doubt that way, though. She’d  have to be a freakishly good actor. Well, I can check with Olesa this  evening, and apologise if need be. I know how hard it is to confess,  after all…though Amane has never lacked confidence in any of our  conversations, unlike Kaname’s many insecurities. Strangely enough,  that’s alienating more than anything else. It makes her so remote…</em>Momomi frowned. <em>I wonder whether she feels that way as well. Whatever, though. That’s not important.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She drummed her fingers against the table. <em>Well,  alternately, she was testing me, like she did before. She appears to  have a phobia of people falling for her, which is bizarre, so she made  sure I rejected her to know that she could trust me to want nothing  more than this loose, airy friendship. Which wouldn’t be very kind of  her, if that was the case… but neither she nor I are kind people. The  third option is, out of altruism, under Olesa’s advice or simply to get  me out of her hair, she’s attempting to make Kaname jealous by playing  at interest in me. With some success, though whether there are any  feelings to bring out… I still doubt that. Kaname is a possessive  friend. Though, I suppose she has a point. It’s not like it’s  impossible that Kaname might be mistaken, but I’m not taking any bets  on it either. What else? Well, for the hell of it, I suppose. If she  really does find me that entertaining when she leads me with words and  plays around with me, that’s a possibility. If that’s the case, she’s  even more messed up than me. It’s also possible, though, that she wants  to push away her fangirls a bit by pretending to be interested in  someone. She did mention that would be useful. Ribbon girl makes me  question the effectiveness of that plan…</em>Momomi rubbed the sides of her head irritably. <em>Damn,  so many possibilities, and still no concrete answers. You’re annoying,  Amane. But it’s pretty impossible for me to work out which is the most  important motivation. There’s nothing I can do. Kaname, on the other  hand, tends to be pretty easy to read, except for when she’s not. If  that makes any sense at all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And then there’s the other  problem. What the hell do I tell Kaname? Well, the truth springs to  mind, but knowing her she’ll want the square peg of truth twisted  around slightly and hammered repeatedly into the round holes in her  head. And she’ll want a reason, as well. I’ve come up with plenty, but  I’ll need to work out which one to use. I mean, Amane’s-true-feelings  probably won’t go down well, but neither can I bring in the fact that  Amane might be trying to make her jealous. I’m rather open to  accusations of complicity on that. I suppose I’d better stick to the  fangirl-warding story. But then is it worth it to lie and say Amane  told me that was the case, or just say that’s my best guess? It’s not  like Kaname is stupid…besides, lying to your best friend is pretty low.  It might be a good idea, all the same, because she can get very  jealous. Honestly, she’d be demanding as a girlfriend, she’s what you’d  call high maintenance. As my best friend, she’s very possessive. I  suppose I like it that way, though. But still. Truth, or lie. And  exactly how to phrase it? Do I explain it from the start as if it’s a  big deal, or wait for her to raise it? What if she doesn’t, and it’s  getting awkward? God, there’s so many variables. Kaname should come  with an instructional manual, it’d make her easier to understand. But  she doesn’t. So I’m stuck. What if she starts shouting at me again? Do  I shout back, or let her work out her frustration…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To the  annoyance of her teachers, it was questions like this, not the four  types of glacial erosion, moraine and the features of glaciated  U-shaped valleys, which preoccupied her mind for much of the rest of  the morning.</span></p>
