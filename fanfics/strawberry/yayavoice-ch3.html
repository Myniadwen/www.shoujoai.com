<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Tsubomi: What’s wrong with you?!</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had chosen to wear my orange sundress today, since I rarely get the  chance to wear it. I had brushed my hair and checked my appearance on  my mirror about five times over, and I was glad to see that the yellow  sandals and yellow purse I went well with my dress. Not that I’m trying  to impress anyone but a girl has got to look her best after all. I left  my room soon after, hoping to see Yaya-sempai waiting for me outside…  but sadly it seemed that she’s running late.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>How rude… she asked me out of a date. She should have been early!’</em> I cursed inwardly but immediately shrugged it off. I stood by outside  the dorm’s entrance and enjoyed the morning breeze. I found myself  thinking and recalling the events that lead me here…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yesterday…  Yaya-sempai asked me to go out with her today. I thought that maybe  Yaya-sempai was jealous of Hikari-sempai? You can really blame me or  the rumors, I know that Hikari-sempai is going out with Ootori-sama.  And although Yaya-sempai is always encouraging Hikari-sempai I wonder  if Yaya-sempai also likes Ootori-sama. And there was also that rumor  that Yaya was turned down by Ootori-sama after they had walked out of  the cafeteria yesterday. I wonder if any of it was true… As I waited  for Yaya-sempai at the front gates of the dorm, I began to recall what  I’ve observed of her for the past few days.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-sempai would be  nowhere insight. I know all to well that Hikari-sempai was worried. Not  that I was worried about her or Yaya-sempai, but she was the choir’s  ace after all so she should really show more dedication else a lot of  the junior choir members might catch her bad habit. Hikari-sempai told  me that she hadn’t seen Yaya-sempai for days. I had been wondering what  had happened between them again… Come to think of it, they never did  tell anyone what happened between them the first time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The day  before yesterday, Hikari-sempai told me that Yaya-chan was back but  unfortunately had lost her voice. I guess that could explain why she  was missing. But still she could have just told us, we would have  understood. But I guess that Yaya-sempai is just like that. Not that I  know her very well!... We’re not exactly close or anything, we’re just  in the same club that’s all!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’ve decided to give her a piece of  my mind as soon as I find her… Which I unfortunately I had to cancel,  seeing that she was following Ootori-sama out of the cafeteria. There  were a lot of talks about the first years about it. Mostly speculative  talks and made up rumors about Yaya-sempai’s long absence. Some of  which are a little too lewd and embarrassing to repeat. A lot of  students tried to follow them, probably to confirm any of the rumors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  our practice yesterday, Hikari-sempai had mentioned that Yaya-sempai  didn’t return to class after lunch break. Luckily our leader wasn’t  feeling well and decided to call of the practice. Hikari-sempai decided  to look for Yaya-sempai or Ootori-sama to ask either about their talk.  I had decided to go back to the dorms after I grab some juice at the  cafeteria. I would never have guessed who I’d run into there…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was snapped back into reality when I felt someone blowing air on my neck…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>IYAAAAAAAAA!!!”</strong> I jumped and screamed loudly then turned almost to attack whoever it  was that did it. I wasn’t surprised to say the least to learn that it  was Yaya-sempai, laughing quite heartily even though all you hear was  the sound of her breathing or should I say the sound of her trying to  breathe. <em>‘Speak of the devil…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>Yaya-sempai!</strong> Why  did you do that?!” I asked rather angrily. Though that made my heart  skip a beat and seeing her in her bold casual clothes; which consisted  of a loose red top a white vest, a black belt bag that she hung loosely  on her waist, a tight fitting blue denim shorts, a pair of red sneakers  and a red baseball hat with her long black hair tied into a pony tail  hanging out of the hat’s back hole. I found her pretty dressed like  that. But… I’d never admit that to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She slowly recovered from her laughing fit and wrote on her notebook<u><em>: ‘Because without my voice, I have to find more creative ways to tease you.’</em></u> She giggled as she showed it to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should grow up and not do it at all. Besides I’m already coming with  you as a favor.” I lectured her like I usually do, even though  Yaya-sempai doesn’t really listen to me. I looked at her and was  surprised to see a soft smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>‘<em>You’re right. I apologize. I won’t do it anymore.’</em></u> She wrote and showed me. Who would have thought that Yaya-sempai could  be reasonable… but then again… The Yaya-sempai I know is a trickster  and a tease, she could be planning something, I should probably be more  careful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway… where are we going?” I picked up my purse, which I had accidentally dropped when she blew air on my neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-sempai  just nodded and opened her notebook which revealed a note that said  that she had a 10 a.m. appointment with a doctor at one of the city’s  hospital.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>Eh?!</strong> Why didn’t you ask Hikari-sempai then? I mean she’s worried about you! You know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she just smiled and flipped a few pages. <u><em>‘That’s exactly why I asked you instead. I know she’ll get even more worried about me if she knows what’s wrong.’ </em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  response surprised me, I mean how did she know that I was going to ask  her that? But then I just thought of it as one of Yaya-sempai’s  qualities as a friend. Not counting the days she was avoiding everyone  of course. That was very thoughtless of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But still she’s  your best friend isn’t she? I’m sure she’d want to know.” I argued. “I  mean we could probably ask her to come with us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But then sempai frowned, and wrote<u><em>; ‘She’s going out with Ootori-sama today. I’d really not want to ruin their plans.’</em></u> I didn’t have any response for that one. Just a sad and disappointed  nod as we walked towards the nearest train station. She walked quietly  beside me almost tripping and bumping her head on a few lamp posts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">About  an hour later, we arrived at the Hospital. Though it was a wonder how  we got there in time and in one piece seeing that Yaya-sempai was  behaving very oddly the whole way here. If anything, I feel like the  reason she asked me to come is to snap her out of the daze she’s in  every now and again. I almost lost her at the train a while ago. I had  to put my arm around hers just so that I don’t loose her before we got  here.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t have to wait long for the doctor to see her. The  nurse asked me to wait in the lobby. But Yaya-sempai looked a little  uneasy when I let go of her arm. Not that I blame her… Not after how I  saw her yesterday…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I found Yaya-sempai was sulking on one of the  cafeteria’s corner tables. It was one of the tables that were almost  hidden from view, covered by some indoor plants and big soft sofa like  diner bench chairs. I approached her fully intent on lecturing her to  shape up. But as I got closer, I noticed that her left wrist was  wrapped in a slightly blood soaked bandage. Her eyes were closed, I had  almost thought that she had fainted and needed medical assistance. But  as I got closer, her eyes flew open and looked at me. I felt a bit  angry, but I didn’t really know why and I think that I didn’t hide it  the least. But to my surprise she didn’t look like she was the least  bit worried or threatened by my presence, this is so unlike her.  Instead she smiled as she flipped her notebook open and wrote:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>‘<em>Tsubomi-chan, are you doing anything tomorrow?’</em></u> I read the note, and more or less confirmed that Yaya-sempai really did  loose her voice. But I had to be sure, so I thought I’d do something  that would make her talk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She just watched me with a curious gaze  as I sat beside her. I looked at her straight in the eye. She looked  nervous by my standards and was about to write something again when… I  placed my hands on her sides and began tickling her. She gasped and  laughed, twitching and struggled to break free from my hold. I kept it  up for a nearly a minute, but she didn’t let out a sound other than the  sound of her breathing. When she had recovered from laughing she then  wrote: <u><em>‘what the hell was that for?!’</em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>Hahaha</strong>…  I’m sorry Yaya-sempai. I just wanted to confirm if it was true that you  lost your voice.” I apologized but couldn’t hold my laughter. She just  looked at me and sighed before leaning on the table all depressed. I  guess I went a little too far.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She closed her eyes for a while. I  had a chance to take a good look at her. She looked a little skinnier  than I could remember; I wonder if she had been skipping meals as well.  Her uniform seemed dirty, like she had fallen on her back. And lastly  the bloodied bandaged… I had wondered where or how she got that injury.  Don’t tell me she almost committed … <em>‘suicide?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-sempai!  You didn’t?!” grabbed her hand pointing at the injury. But she just  looked at me with an almost lifeless stare, before flipping her  notebook open and wrote: <u><em>‘Didn’t what?’</em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  initially thought that she was playing dumb, like she usually does. I  acted on instinct and said “You didn’t try to commit suicide didn’t  you?” I had almost yelled that out. But it was a good thing that not  many students were in the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes just looked at me  and blinked in confusion. For a moment I noticed her eyes fall on her  bandaged wrist, her eyes widened a little seemingly realizing what I  mean. She then opened her notebook and wrote; <u><em>‘I got scratched running away from Ootori…’</em></u> I found it odd why Yaya-sempai called Ootori-sama… Ootori. She used to  call her Amane, without any honorific… Like a close friend… or rival.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I read on as she continued trying to hold my tongue long enough for her to write down what she wants to. <u><em>‘…but that seems like a good idea right now…’</em></u> I cringed at that, I felt angrily... but I didn’t know to whom I was  angry… Yaya-sempai wasn’t like herself. I was about to yell when I saw  her hands move continuing to write. <u><em>‘… would anyone miss me? When I’m gone?’</em></u> I was shocked to say anything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why  is she so depressed? Is it so bad that she wants to die? Who else is  involved? I bet each of these questions will only raise more questions  after them. And as I looked at her it didn’t seem like the right time  to ask.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I composed myself and tried to not look too concerned.  “I’m not doing anything tomorrow. What did you have in mind?” I tried  not to look at her, I turned my attention to check if there were  eavesdroppers listening in our conversation. Thankfully there were  none. Coz I screamed when I saw…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>‘<em>Let’s go on a date!’</em></u> was her readied response. The page had drawings of characters that I  assumed to be of me and her walking hand in hand shaded and colored  with different colored pens emphasizing her words even more. She was  smiling quite widely. But it looked like it was forced to me. But I  dared not bring it up. After I recovered from the shock, I agreed…  slightly reluctant and maybe even a little regretful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-sempai  is a really difficult person to understand… One moment you’re so  concerned that she’s depressed, next thing you know she’s asking you  out on a date. I mean, Yaya-sempai is cool and talented and all that…  She’s quite a beauty as well, though Hikari-sempai is much more cute  and responsible. I mean… I don’t know anymore… maybe I’m kind of  disappointed that this was just a hospital trip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My thoughts were  thankfully interrupted when Yaya-sempai took my hand and urged me to  follow her. I had my doubts about this, I offered that she should go in  alone, after all she deserves the right to keep whatever it is she has  secret from everyone if she wants. But had it been any other day I  think Yaya-chan wouldn’t even ask me to be here with here. She writes  in her notebook; <u><em>‘I’m a bit afraid th...’ </em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I can’t help but feel a little touched. <em>‘Does she trust me that much?... at least enough to tell me that she’s afraid of something.’</em> I thought. I mean who would have guessed that Yaya-sempai who’s only  close friend is Hikari-sempai would ask me instead of her best friend.  I didn’t wait for her to finish, she had lowered herself enough right?  I closed the notebook and smiled. “Let’s go.” I said as I took her hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-sempai  looked at me with a confused sad gaze for a few seconds. Her lips move  and I could tell that she said; my name… and thank you, for some reason  before letting out a genuine soft smile and nods.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We entered the  room where the doctor was waiting for Yaya-sempai. I apologized for the  both of us for taking up her time. But the doctor seemed nice enough  and said that she didn’t mind. She then asked us to sit down before she  began telling us the news of Yaya-sempai’s condition. Sempai was  shaking; I could see and feel her shaking. I placed a hand on hers  which clutched the ends of her denim shorts and held her hand tight. I  could see a tiny smile crept up her lip when I did. Which made me feel…  happy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanto, Yaya-san all the tests say…” The doctor paused and  looked at the report sheets about twice over. Sempai had her eyes  closed; I could only guess what was on her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…that your throat is fine.” She finished. The doctor sounded rather confused and surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Without thinking I reacted… “<strong>How could that be</strong>?!” I stood from my seat and yelled at the doctor. <strong>“If her throat is fine then why can’t she speak!?”</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  room went silent for a while. The doctor pondered a bit. I turned to  look at sempai. She looked disappointed but not as shocked as I was,  probably almost expecting the results but hoping something else was  wrong.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My personal opinion would be that she had suffered some  kind of mental or emotional trauma that had led her to subconsciously  desire not to talk anymore… But that’s only my opinion. I have to be  honest I’m as shocked as you are miss.” She addressed me, rather  professionally. I fell back onto my seat after. I felt loss and sorry  for Yaya-sempai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can recommend a psychiatrist if you want.” I turned to Yaya, and saw her shaking her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not sempai?” I was curious as to why she didn’t want see one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  slowly opens her notebook, with the same lost, depressed look in her  eyes. But instead the doctor answered. “Well I can understand…  Psychiatrists are quite expensive. And it’s not even sure if they can  really help you.” I doubted her words, I know what she said was by fact  true… but I doubt that Yaya-sempai didn’t want to see a Psychiatrist  for a different reason. And at that point I just didn’t want to press  her anything against her will.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” At that point there was  nothing left to do but thank the doctor for her time, pay the doctor’s  fee and leave the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We were on our way to the train station when, Yaya-sempai suddenly lets go of my hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-sempai, you’ll get lost if you don’t hold on to me!” I playfully lectured her, trying to sound as much as I normally do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looks at me and smiles. She flips thru the pages of her book searching  for a page, when she finds it she holds onto my hand again and show’s  me the colorful page yesterday. It says: <u>‘<em>Let’s go on a date!’</em></u> once again… I am shocked. I looked at her questioningly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked serious, her amber eyes looked sad but I could tell that she  wanted to cheer up somehow. She looked almost pleading like a little  puppy, I didn’t really have to think about it to long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled and took her hand again. “Let’s go then!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was more than happy to see Yaya-sempai beamed at my response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  enjoyed a slow stroll around the entertainment streets of the city,  Yaya-sempai would occasionally pull me into random shops every now and  again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One such shop was frilly dress shop where I had the  displeasure of being sempai’s dress up doll. She had forced me into a  few sundresses, one of which was a pink one laced with a few red frills  around the neck, shoulders and skirt ends. Yaya-sempai forbade me to  look in the mirror while she inspected me in the pink and red dress.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-sempai…”  I sounded almost begging to get out of here. I was very embarrassed I  know that people do these things on dates but… I mean… sempai and I  aren’t like that. I then saw Sempai’s look brighten like she had gotten  an idea, she walks a way for a bit and looks for something. I was very  tempted to look in the mirror behind me but I felt like she was going  to look back at anytime and didn’t dare. She returns with a small red  purse and a red lacy ribbon on her hands and tied it on my hair. She  looks at me and straightens up the dress. I noticed that she was  smiling almost like she had forgotten her troubles. I have to say that  her smile is infectious and I couldn’t help but smile myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then motions for me to look at the mirror; I noted that she was about  write something. I turned and looked at myself and almost didn’t  recognize me. “Is that me?” I asked rather dumbfounded. I don’t mean to  brag but I know that I’m pretty… but wow… I… I’m…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>‘<em>You’re cute!’</em></u> was what she wrote…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just cute?” I asked without masking the disappointment in my voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she just shook her head and tapped the note again, with a big smile on  her face. That’s when I realized that “cute” was Yaya-sempai’s  complement to beauty. I blushed as I recall Yaya-sempai always teasing  Hikari-sempai about being cute in anything… <em>‘I wonder if I can ever be that cute.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then watched her pick up the clothes that I was wearing in here before  she walked to the cashier and write something on her notebook. The lady  nods with a smile after seeing the note. I walked up to sempai  wondering what it was that she told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-sempai. What did you… tell… her?” I was shocked to see that she was holding a credit card with the note.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a smile she showed me the note that said: <u><em>‘My friend will be wearing the dress on the way out.’ </em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  buying this dress?!!” I yelled, and managed to embarrass myself to a  few customers. But Yaya-sempai just waved at them to mind their own  businesses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She nods and writes: <u><em>‘Because you’re so cute in that!’</em></u> I blushed brightly as soon as I saw the words you and cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I began wondering if Yaya-sempai was… <em>‘No  way! That couldn’t be true… right?! I’m sure that she’s just trying to  repay me for accompanying her to the doctor… Yeah that’s it… haha…’</em> I somehow managed to disappoint myself. I didn’t notice the cashier  walk up behind me and take off the price clips that made sure the item  can’t be stolen. I watch as Yaya-sempai pay for my new dress. It must  have cost her quite a lot. I heard that her family is rich and all but…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  walks up to me, carrying the shop’s bag where my clothes and bag are  now in. I was about to take them but she surprised me by taking my arm  and escorting me out of the shop. We began walking around again… I felt  a little embarrassed to be wearing this out here, and even more  embarrassed that Yaya-sempai was walking around holding onto me like we  were… lovers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She leads me into a nice café. I was about to seat  opposite of her but I saw her pointing on the seat beside her. And for  some reason… I found myself sitting beside her, finding it almost  impossible to say no to her. She held an arm around my waist bringing  me closer to her seat and that was when the waitress decided to come  over. She was blushing and looked almost envious, when she noticed  Yaya-sempai’s arm was around me. “Welcome to Linden Baum. My name is  Mai and I’ll be you’re waitress for today. Are you ready to order?” she  asked trying to sound very polite and cheerful, despite the awkward  situation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I ordered a sandwich and a strawberry float while  sempai pointed at pasta dish and a mango parfait. The blushing waitress  quickly went away to get our orders. I turned to Yaya-sempai, and she  had her eyes closed while resting her head on my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-sempai?...” I shook her a little but I soon realized that she had fallen asleep on my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>That was fast…’</em> I thought about waking her, but quickly decided that it was ok. I mean,  she’s been thru a lot… even though I don’t know what had happened to  her I felt that she’s trying to deal with it on her own. I kind of had  a new found respect for Yaya-sempai. I allowed her to take a short nap  while we wait for the food to be served.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As I was watching  Sempai’s sleeping face, I couldn’t help but blush at the thoughts that  crossed my mind. I had almost slapped myself just to regain composure.  But just as I thought I was getting used to this… Yaya-sempai suddenly  shifted and her head fell and laid on my lap. I swear I thought I was  going to scream when I felt her hair tickle my legs. But that wasn’t my  only problem; some of the other customers were beginning to stare at  me. <em>‘This is so embarrassing…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And just for a second I  thought I heard Hikari-sempai calling Yaya-sempai. I looked around, but  didn’t see her so I had assumed that my mind was playing tricks on me…  Maybe the food was taking too long.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minutes later the waitress  returned with our order, blushing even harder after seeing where  Sempai’s head was now. She quickly but carefully placing our orders in  front of us and said to me: “Please take your time and call me if you  need anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>The “take your time” sounded malicious to me…’</em> I thought. I pinched myself hoping that this was a big embarrassing dream. <em>‘… Guess it’s not.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  winked and quickly made her way to another table to attend to other  customers. Having her leave made me a bit relieved somehow. I shook  sempai’s shoulder trying to wake her up. “Sempai. Sempai!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes slowly opened and she looked at me, still lying on my lap. <u>‘Tsu-bo-mi’</u> I saw her spell my name with her lips. I just smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The food is here sempai. Let’s eat.” She nodded and yawn before trying to get off my lap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Itadakimasu!” I said as I clasped my hands together before I began eating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the middle of the meal, sempai suddenly took one of my sandwiches and ate it. “Ah! Sempai! That was mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She just smiled and rolled some of her pasta onto her fork and held it out for me to eat. <em>‘She’s… She’s… She’s going to feed me!’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She open’s her mouth; I could almost hear her pronouncing “Aaaaah……” for me, making me open my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was embarrassed, but I kind of liked it somehow. I could feel my heart  beating faster. I opened my mouth and allowed the food’s entry. The  tasty white sauce, mixed with some cheese and bits fish filled my mouth  tingling my taste buds. I was better than the sandwich I ordered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  was delicious!” I told her. She smiled and offered me another fork roll  of pasta. We shared the rest of our meal. It was embarrassing for me,  but for some reason Yaya-sempai didn’t seem the least bit embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sempai  paid using her credit card for both our meals, I tried to pay my share  but she had hidden my wallet. I’m guessing she did it while I was  changing into this pink dress. I felt angry at her for doing so, but I  also felt flattered that she bothered doing so just to make sure she  would be paying for both of us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We then continued our stroll  around town. Yaya-sempai insisted that we watch a movie. I agreed not  knowing that she had chosen a horror move until we were inside. I was  screaming and holding onto her the whole movie… I'm sure she chose a  scary movie on purpose... After that she dragged me into a game center  saying that it could help make me forget about the horror movie. We  played a few games, most of which I lost against her. But only because  I wasn't fully comfortable with what I was wearing, at least not yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  she got tired of wining, we continued exploring for more shops. I found  myself being dragged into a art supply shop. Where I found myself  watching the owner carve something out of a piece of wood while I  waited for Sempai to get what she wanted. I was surprised to see her  bring a sketchpad, a box of colored pencils, a big box of expensive oil  paint a few different brushes, an easel and a few ready canvases. The  owner stopped his carving and proceeded to calculate the total amount  of her purchase.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sempai… isn’t that a little too much?” I asked  rather surprised with the sheer amount of items she decided to buy.  “How are we going to carry all this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry little miss.  We can deliver it to you later for a little fee.” The owner smiled,  seemingly happy to see that Yaya-sempai was quite a buyer. “You can  also call us if you ever need more supplies.” He hand’s Yaya-sempai a  business card.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sempai just nods and happily pays for all the  items. The owner then takes our dorm’s address and sempai’s contact  details just incase. He then packs them and sets them aside. “I’ll have  them sent as soon as one of my delivery men gets back from the last  order.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I thanked him for Yaya-sempai, before being unnecessarily  dragged out of the shop with her arm wrapped around mine. We ended up  in a instrument shop where Yaya-sempai astonished me by playing  “Cannon” on a violin. I swear my jaw dropped so low I thought I  dislocated it. When she ended there was a big applause from all the  customers. Yaya-sempai bowed gracefully, and replaced the instrument on  it’s stand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sempai… where did you learn that?” I had to ask. She  wrote that she had violin and piano lessons, before she transferred to  Spica. <em>‘She plays the Piano too?!’ </em>I felt faint… Yaya-sempai’s  talents are just too much. How can one person have so many talents but  not have any dedication to them… <em>‘It’s so unfair…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  the instrument shop, we started heading back to the train station. We  stopped only for some iced tea to refresh ourselves before slightly  long train ride back to Astrea Hill. The train was almost empty when we  rode. I swore I saw a few Spica students from Yaya-sempai’s year level.  They glanced at us just when Yaya-sempai decided to use my lap as a  pillow again. I was blushing yet again. I kept my head down trying not  to make eye contact with the few people that were there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  train arrived at Astrea Hill. I was more that glad Yaya-sempai woke up  before anyone had the chance to actually see her lie on me up close. We  allowed everyone else to disembark first, knowing that the train won’t  be leaving soon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya then tapped my shoulder and showed me a note: <u><em>‘I had a good time!’</em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“M…  m… me too…” I had trouble saying it… but I’m glad I did. She smiled and  offered me her arm. I blushed as I took it and allowed her to lead me  out of the train.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We were silent as we walked towards the dorm.  Or maybe I should say I was silent, Yaya-sempai really had no choice in  the matter. That twenty minute walk to the dorms seemed like seconds  for once. We reached the dorm’s entrance and I was disappointed that my  day with her has to end already. I had unconsciously stared at sempai  the whole way, if she noticed she either didn’t mind or she didn’t  care… or so I thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She grinned as she wrote: <u><em>‘Let’s do this again sometime!’</em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I blushed and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  both hands she gently cupped the sides of my face, and then the next  thing that happened surprised me more than anything that happened today…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">… <strong>to be continued.</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Author’s Notes:</strong> Yep Mai Tokiha makes her cameo from Mai-Hime again. and know that the  café is the name of the café she works in, at least in the anime. I had  trouble with writing this XD I felt lazy for a while. And to those  wondering if Yaya is that talented. ;; I don’t really know. But I’d  like to think she is.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Now for an Omake!:</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: Eh?! There were rumors!?!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi: Yeah! A whole lot of them!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: Like what?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi: there’s this one where given a 2 week suspension for breaking some rule. Which a lot of us found probable knowing you…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: Shut up… what else?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi: there was also one where, you ran away and eloped with someone…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: Unlikely… anything else?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi:  well there was where Ootori-sama had been keeping you in her room as  her love slave, which could explain why no one could find you for the  last few days… But this one was fairly new, and sprang up only after  they saw you following Ootori-sama</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: (gasps, eyes wide opened.) …WAAA?!! … Girls these days are such perverts…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi: you just insulted the both of us as well. Yaya-sempai…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: (sweat drops) …</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane: That last one sounded interesting…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: (gulp)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari: (gasp blush)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi: (gasp)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane: (grin)</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Omake End</strong></span></p>
