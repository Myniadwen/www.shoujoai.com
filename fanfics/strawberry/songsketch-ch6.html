<h1>A Song and a Sketch (part 6 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bblade.html">bleeding.blade</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/songsketch-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The first snows had just begun to blanket the school, when Tsubomi got 
the call. Beyond the occasional letter (letters she had wisely kept from 
Yaya), Tsubomi had not heard from Hikari at all in the last several 
months. But the sobs on the other side of the line were instantly 
recognizable. Even after having heard it countless times, the sound of 
Hikari in distress never failed to turn Tsubomi into a quivering mass of 
sympathetic mush. She nearly hated herself for it.

&quot;Hikari-senpai...What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Amane-san, Tsubomi-chan...&quot; Tsubomi resisted the urge to tell the 
blonde woman that that fact was patently obvious. Only Amane ever got 
Hikari into this state. In between sobs, Hikari managed to tell Tsubomi 
that she had seen Amane kissing another woman from the National 
Equestrian Team.

Tsubomi listened in mild disbelief. She found it hard to believe that 
Amane (kind, gentle, if somewhat crashingly, boringly perfect, Amane) 
could be capable of infidelity. But from the story that she slowly 
pieced from Hikari, she could easily understand the blonde woman&#39;s 
insecurity. Amane&#39;s competitions often took her away for days, sometimes 
weeks, at a time. Hikari&#39;s university schedule didn&#39;t always make it 
possible for her to accompany the blue-haired rider. And then, for the 
last several months, since Tsubomi had left for university in another 
city, Hikari had had no one to boost her confidence.

&quot;Have you tried talking to Amane-sama about it, Hikari-senpai?&quot; Tsubomi 
asked gently. &quot;It&#39;s possible that it was all a misunderstanding...&quot;

A flurry of fresh sobs on the other side of the phone told her to 
abandon her current line of inquiry.

&quot;Yaya-chan...Yaya-chan would...never have done...anything like this...&quot; 
Tsubomi&#39;s heart sank at the mention of Yaya&#39;s name. The blonde woman 
took a few moments to quiet down, then asked Tsubomi, 
&quot;Tsubomi-chan...could you please...pick me up?&quot;

Tsubomi froze. Somewhere inside her, she could feel the urge to break 
out into hysterical laughter. &quot;Hikari-senpai...you didn&#39;t...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m at the station,&quot; the blonde answered her softly. Tsubomi closed her 
eyes. If there was a God, he would send a bus crashing into her scooter 
before she arrived at her destination.

~~~~~

Hikari stared wide-eyed at the screen in front of her. In it, a 
hypnotically stunning Yaya was singing full-throated with eyes closed 
into a studio mike. Tsubomi couldn&#39;t blame Hikari for her reaction. No 
matter how many times she&#39;d seen it herself, the video of Yaya&#39;s 
unplugged sessions never failed to reduce her to jelly.

As much as Tsubomi had tried to conceal the fact of Yaya&#39;s close-by 
existence from Hikari, there was no way she could hide it after Hikari 
had arrived at her apartment. Her flat was a veritable shrine to the 
black-haired singer, with music sheets, recordings and videos littering 
the few corners that weren&#39;t covered with her own sketches.

When Hikari had found out that Tsubomi had been Yaya&#39;s close friend for 
the past several months, she had pestered the younger woman for details. 
In her excitement, the blonde had forgotten to be indignant of the fact 
that Tsubomi hadn&#39;t mentioned Yaya at all in her letters. 

&quot;So she&#39;s singing? Tonight?&quot; The eagerness on Hikari&#39;s face caused a 
wrenching pain in Tsubomi&#39;s gut. Even as she hated herself for it, she 
knew what she would end up doing.

&quot;Why don&#39;t we surprise her?&quot; Tsubomi found herself saying. She even 
smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure Yaya-senpai will be...floored to see you again after 
all these years.&quot;

Hikari nodded happily. &quot;Oh, Tsubomi-chan, you really are the best!&quot;

~~~~~

While Hikari showered and readied herself in Tsubomi&#39;s bathroom, the 
pink-haired woman walked over to her closet and pulled out a carefully 
wrapped box. She had been planning to give it to Yaya as a Christmas 
present, but decided that the current situation was actually the perfect 
opportunity. (Never mind that it was an opportunity that was despicably, 
appallingly cruel to her; not to mention ironic.)  She called out to 
Hikari over the sound of rushing water.

&quot;Hikari-senpai, I&#39;m just going to go out for a while okay? I&#39;ll be back 
soon to take you to the bar.&quot;

She left the box at Yaya&#39;s dressing room, leaving the brunette specific 
instructions to wear the outfit at her performance later that night. If 
that doesn&#39;t beat that damned white horse, I don&#39;t know what will. With 
a fierce nod to herself, and a furious dab at her eyes, Tsubomi left the 
bar to fetch Hikari.

~~~~~

Yaya had been surprised to find the box waiting for her at the club. The 
note on the cover simply said, Christmas came early this year. Wear it 
tonight or I&#39;ll kill you. Yaya shook her head; perhaps Tsubomi had been 
having another of her weird moments.

When she took out the box&#39;s contents, however, she gasped in pure, 
surprised pleasure. There was a black tube dress of a velvety material; 
the skirt flared in an A-line ending at her upper thigh; the bodice was 
in the style of a corset, complete with lacings at the front. Then there 
was a sheer long-sleeved white tunic with billowing sleeves tapering 
into French cuffs and a turndown collar; the tunic was apparently meant 
to be worn underneath the tube dress. And at the very bottom of the pile 
was a pair of thigh-length, high-heeled black boots.  The style wasn&#39;t 
signature Tsubomi, but it was well-designed all the same.

Looking at it, Yaya couldn&#39;t help feeling that although the ensemble 
covered most of her skin, it nevertheless left little to the imagination 
- and what little was left remained purely for titillation. Actually, 
Yaya realized, Tsubomi had designed the dress to perfectly match her 
favorite jazz repertoire, which mostly contained songs that the younger 
woman had variously labeled &quot;innocent seductions&quot; or 
&quot;the-no&#39;s-that-mean-yes&quot;. Yaya shook her head with a smile. Tsubomi&#39;s 
growing talent never failed to amaze her.

With anticipation, she began to change into her new outfit. </pre>
