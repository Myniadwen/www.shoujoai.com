<p>“I remember  now. This is why I like hanging around with you guys.” Amiki cocked her  head, smirking slightly. “You’re a real life, walking soap opera. Is  Momomi cheating on Kaname with the school idol? Find out next week on  Astraea Hill!”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, please. That was spontaneous action on her part, and platonic as well. There’s nothing between us!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More importantly, I didn’t even know there was anything for Kiyashiki-san to cheat on,” Shion remarked, smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that too.” Momomi folded her arms. “But do these two care? They’ll say anything they like, just for the hell of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  sometimes I wonder, but you two always let me down,” Amiki remarked,  closing her eyes and shrugging. “Kaname’s hyper-possessive personality  is something, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d just like to clarify that we aren’t  here for your entertainment,” Momomi retorted. “And, if it comes to  that, why don’t you two do anything interesting? You’re in the same  position as us, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve said what needs to be said,” Olesa replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Implying  we haven’t?” Momomi sighed. “We’re much the same, and that’s the way it  is. That’s all there is. The problem is people like you who keep  looking out for a more theatrical ending…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. If that helps you sleep at night.” Amiki glanced at her. “But tell me, how are your study dates going?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Study dates? We’re working very hard towards the scholarship exams, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on.” Momomi rolled her eyes. “So if any two people work on something together, that’s automatically a date, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, not that.” Amiki gave her a casual look. “But if you two work on something together, it <em>is </em>automatically a date. That’s how you act.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you don’t know, more fool you. Am I wrong, Tomori-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t like to take sides,” Shion replied innocently. “But she does have  a point, Kiyashiki-san. You two always have a good atmosphere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. I’m thick-skinned but you lot are trying to piss me off now!  Just shut up!” Momomi glowered, then glanced at Kaname for moral  support. Unfortunately, the girl was trapped in a reverie. “Honestly,”  she muttered, looking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” Amiki  replied. “But still, that’s just how it appears to people. It’s not  like we’re the only ones thinking this way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which is why the  whole school, more or less, has taken this to be a love rivalry between  Kenjou-kun and Ohtori-san over Kiyashiki-san.” Shion laughed. “That’s  the wonderful thing about rumours, it doesn’t have to relate to  reality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not wonderful, that’s just bloody annoying,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion smiled. “Of course, they also say that there’s no smoke without fire.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’d  better begin. We’ll be spending some time together again, under various  circumstances, after all.” Olesa walked away in the direction of the  cupboard, followed by the others. Except for Shion, of course, who  merely sat on one of the benches and watched with an indulgent smile on  her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, how is the intelligence gathering on  Amane going?” Amiki asked. “Hmm… intelligence gathering… now there’s a  euphemism in the making<em>. I was gathering intelligence on Amane’s topography</em>… something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up.” Momomi rolled her eyes. “She’s still bloody confusing and  spontaneous. Basically, she likes forcing the conversation one way or  the other in order to get me to say things, but if I try and do that to  her she simply won’t answer my questions. That’s a little unfair, to  say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, at least she’s showing an interest in  you.” Amiki passed Olesa a bucket and mop. “If she was really bored  with you, she wouldn’t bother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Under the circumstances, that’s  of limited consolation,” Momomi complained. “Besides, I’m almost sure  she’s been put up to this by a certain someone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shouldered her mop. “If you mean me, I’ve made her aware of the situation between you two as I understand it. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.”  Momomi gave her a suspicious glare, then turned away and headed for the  fountain. “Well, whatever. It’s still very annoying of her. Come to  that, can’t you just ask Olesa? She knows more than me, I do know that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s more interesting when I ask you, you know,” Amiki replied. “Besides, not even Olesa knows a lot about Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  nodded briefly. “I talk to her. No more. I’m not the one who said so  proudly that she’d unravel all the secrets of the ice prince.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well, I’m starting to wonder whether even Amane knows who Amane is,”  Momomi retorted. “She’s chaotic, to say the least. But I’ve still  learned a few things. For a start, she shares your flair for deadpan  humour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m always serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See? Things like that are exactly what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  just shrugged and stepped ahead, beginning to fill her bucket. Momomi  glanced behind her and frowned at Kaname, who looked far away again.  She hadn’t said a thing in the longest time, and it was starting to get  worrying. “Hey, are you alright? You look a little broody.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine,” Kaname remarked absently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh-ho.  That’s bad news, Momomi.” Amiki looked back over her shoulder as she  filled her own buckets. “Looks like she wasn’t happy with you kissing  her rival.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t kiss anyone. If you’re going to spin rumours, at least get some of the facts right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly  the point. Well, its not that’s a good reason for her to resent you  anyway, under the circumstances. But Kenjou’s like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever,” Kaname retorted. “I’m fine. Talking to you guys would be a waste of my time anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, excuse me,” Amiki said. “But that’s okay. I can appreciate that you’re lovesick, so feel free to take your time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up. You’re annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. <em>As Kaname’s retorts go, that was on the weak side. But I thought we’d sorted everything out in lunchtime. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her for a moment, then looked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki closed her eyes and rubbed her head impatiently. “My, my. Looks like the truth hurts. Oh, well. Have it your way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can you two give it a rest for a moment?” Momomi asked. “It’s like you’re both pushing an agenda, and it’s getting annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, well, that hasn’t unduly affected Kaname’s robust personality,” Amiki remarked. “Until now, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s leave it here for now,” Olesa stated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi walked back to the Church, feeling uncomfortable. <em>If Olesa’s the one calling a cease-fire, you know something is wrong. </em>She  glanced worriedly at Kaname, only to find the girl looking at her. But  she turned away instantly, embarrassed. Momomi sighed. <em>Well, now I  know what’s even worse than her yelling at me for no real reason. Her  walking around in a funk without saying anything. Just my luck, isn’t  it? I explained, already! </em>“So, the same as usual?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Olesa replied. They both got to work, wetting their mops and washing the floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  lost herself in the simple motions for a few moments, marvelling at how  much they’d both improved. “You know… after several weeks of this, we  can pass ourselves off as almost normal at cleaning things. I just  noticed that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One part of a commoner’s life down, only several  hundred more to go,” Amiki remarked. “I don’t want to blunt your  enthusiasm, but you still have some way to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, be fair.  As far as I can tell, even normal girls my age are pretty hopeless,”  Momomi replied. “So don’t expect too much of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, well,  that’s a matter of an age gap.” Amiki wetted her mop again, wringing  out the dirt. “This time even thirty years ago, I’m sure things would  have been different. But parents are more indulgent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should be careful, Rivera-san,” Shion warned. “You’re starting to sound like one of the Sisters.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it looks that way to me. It seems like kids my age do a lot less work  than they used to. I mean, don’t get me wrong. I tank rush with the  rest of my generation and spam forums all I like, but it still annoys  me how carefree people are now. It’s not practical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On tank  rushing and forum spamming… well, speak for yourself,” Momomi observed.  “But you hardly have a balanced pool of data. This is a boarding school  for the hyper-rich. Of course we’re all like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Amiki admitted. “But still, more than just here, that’s the impression I get from this age. Perhaps I’m wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there’s one thing you’re forgetting,” Shion replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? What’s that, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rising  divorce rates. The children of broken families have to do more chores,  so this generation is probably even more practical at their age than  any for a few decades.” Shion smiled. “Just my guess. But I’m sure  there’s something in it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m surrounded by such positive  people,” Momomi grumbled. She glanced at Kaname, but her friend wasn’t  really paying any attention at all. That made her lips tighten with  worry. <em>Honestly, this is the kind of topic she’d normally eat up. She loves bashing us rich kids. What the hell is up with her?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s leave destructive cynicism to the half-dead, shall we?” Olesa remarked. “It’s their prerogative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “Well, that’s nice of you. Didn’t anyone tell you to respect your elders?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa just shrugged. “I respect those who deserve it. Not those who feel entitled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As expected of an egotist like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, hey,” Amiki interrupted. “Are you telling us that you’re any different?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Not really, I suppose. But still, you could be more polite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t really matter, does it?” Amiki asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I suppose not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  another good one,” Shion remarked. “My father’s very hot on age  discrimination. And when I say that, I mean he wants to be able to hire  and fire who he damn well pleases. In his words, age isn’t like  religion, it will affect your work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Free market capitalism at its finest.” Momomi rolled her eyes. “Such a loving thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we have to be practical. But to be honest, I suspect my father’s bold  ideological stand is mostly because he likes seeing fresh faces around  the office and firing people before they can ask for too many pay  rises.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that’s where you get your ruthless streak,” Amiki observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, that’s about your father,” Momomi commented. “What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  shrugged. “Well, I’m not keen on discrimination against the young, but  I don’t mind discrimination against the old. If I become an experienced  employee I’ll be against it outright. If I become an employer I’ll  sound more like my father. Issues like this are impossible to separate  from cold pragmatism, if you ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “The concept of idealism and morality are completely lost on you, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those  are just retrospective justifications, if you ask me,” Shion said. “As  far as I’m concerned, most people really think like me. I’m just more  honest. Just examine the existence of class-based voting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not one of them myself, but people do have principles, you know.” Momomi gave her friend yet another worried look. <em>She looks so absent…</em>“You can’t ignore that just because it’s cool to be cynical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  shrugged and smiled. “I hope you’re right, Kiyashiki-san. But really,  none of us know much about the world. We’re just guessing with  confidence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, you know what gets me?” Momomi asked,  speaking a little louder than was strictly necessary. “Discrimination  based on sexuality. I mean, what the hell does that have to do with how  good a worker you’ll be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Precisely none,” Shion agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  Japanese law doesn’t address that at all!” Momomi snapped. “On the  contrary, it isn’t talked about at all. Italy isn’t much better, but  attitudes are different. And we’re the happy hosts of the Roman  Catholic Church, who believe in armour-piercing sperm and the  importance of choking Africa to death with excessive population growth!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not so loud, please,” Amiki remarked. “This <em>is </em>a Catholic school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as irreverent as Kenjou-kun,” Shion observed. “But your research is good, if nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She cares about these things.” Kaname was looking elsewhere, but at least she’d spoken.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  nodded. “Well, of course I do. And that’s not just a matter of  pragmatic self-interest, either. It makes me so mad; to think that I’ll  grow up persecuted if I express who I am. That’s why I’m glad this  school, at least, is a bastion of sensible morality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For once,  you have a point,” Amiki commented. “However, people won’t change even  if we wish them too. Once you’re out of here, you should probably keep  our head down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hate that kind of attitude.” Momomi folded her  arms. “If everyone does that, nothing will ever change, you know. We  have to be proactive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps, but you don’t want to starve, do  you?” Amiki replied bluntly. “The way I see it, you can fight young and  suffer, or play quietly until you’re important enough to be safer.  Isn’t that just sensible?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sensible, yes, but I shouldn’t have  to do that,” Momomi retorted. “If I start thinking and acting like  that, it’s an acknowledgement of their false position in the first  place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This must be what idealism looks like,” Shion murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can say that while you’re here, but you do have to be practical,” Amiki  observed. “Or, hell, move if it bothers you so much. Go to the UK or  somewhere like that, it’s not like you’ll have language problems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not the point.” Momomi folded her arms. “As far as I’m concerned, this country is my home country now. I’ll do it here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You aren’t very realistic, are you?” Amiki rolled her eyes. “Words are easier than actions, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Olesa glanced at her thoughtfully, for the first time in a while.  “Don’t compromise, fight and take everything… that’s what you’re  referring to, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Momomi nodded. “Maybe that’s  stupid, but it’s how I want to live my life. I don’t want to be in some  London suburb wondering whether I’d have become accustomed to sushi if  I’d kept at it. And I don’t want to be with a cushy job and a nice  apartment here, wondering whether I could have done so much more. I  won’t compromise, I’ll… well, I’ll be myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those are the  words of the daughter who rebelled against her father.” Shion closed  her eyes. “They’re a little inspiring, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And a little  disturbing.” Kaname looked at Momomi, smiling slightly. “Someone who  takes everything at any cost can trample over others, can’t they?  Idealists are willing to sacrifice people for the cause.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not a terrorist or anything,” Momomi replied. “Don’t make me sound too evil. I’m just… intense, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s alright.” Kaname turned away again. “I like that about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Well… good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki rolled her eyes. “Hate to interrupt the love-fest, but we still have a Church to clean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah.” Momomi snorted cynically. “You were taking part until two seconds ago, so it’s not like you can talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  closed her eyes. “It’s an interesting subject, though. Kiyashiki-san is  an unconditional idealist. Rivera-san is a pragmatist. How about you  two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa closed her eyes. “I’ll do whatever’s necessary to achieve what I want to achieve. I’ve always been that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. As calculating as ever,” Momomi complained. “And people say I’m manipulative. I don’t manipulate myself, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  do, more often than you’d think. But I hadn’t finished.” Olesa glanced  at her. “But more recently, I’m beginning to understand that I have to  live for myself as well. And that includes being able to live with  myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion nodded. “That’s a fairly balanced approach. And you, Kenjou-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “I’ll do whatever makes sense to me at the time. Do you need anything more?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion chuckled. “No, I suppose not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me?” Shion smiled innocently. “Oh, my principle is enlightened self-interest.”</span></p>
Momomi made a face. “Great. Whatever that entails…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eventually, untidily and as noisily as the Spica Debating Society’s  rowdier moments, they managed to finish cleaning the Church for a day.  Kaname started to join in again but she still drifted off at abrupt  intervals, looking past them and letting their conversation wash over  her. That worried Momomi, but still. If Kaname wasn’t happy about  something, Kaname would tell you. Most likely she needed some time to  think, something Momomi was familiar with. It wasn’t like she’d chosen  to be together with them all right now, after all. At least she’d shown  up. Best to sit her out rather than worrying too much, probably. So she  looked away and tried to put her friend out of mind, but still it  gnawed at her nerves. <em>Honestly, what have I done now? She’s so troublesome sometimes…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, Kenjou, let’s go,” Amiki remarked. “I’ll kick your ass again  today. Or more likely, watch Kariya drill you. Hurry up and get better,  already. I need to put you in your place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t go today,” Kaname replied absently. “I’ve got something to take care of.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Something?” Amiki groaned. “You’d better not be chickening out on me, Kenjou. I still owe you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just for tonight. Tell Kariya for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell  her yourself. She’s dedicated and expects everyone else in the club to  be dedicated. She won’t teach anyone who doesn’t make the evening meet  on a regular basis, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’ve been commandeered by  her lover-girl to take care of something or other,” Kaname explained,  sticking her hands in her pockets. “It’s not like I’m happy about this,  either, you know. But it’s not like I have a choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki rolled her eyes. “Fine. Whatever. But what does Serané want with you anyway? Is she telling you off again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope. I just need to help her in the greenhouse. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm…  but doesn’t she have sixth years for that?” Amiki frowned. “So why you?  I bet you don’t know one side of the trowel from another.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do,” Kaname retorted. “You stab people with the pointy end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  what it’s worth, my suspicion is that Serané-sama has come up with a  pretext for a discreet lecture,” Shion observed. “It’s how she  operates. As opposed to Kariya-sama, who does not place much stock in  discretion, especially in matters of discipline.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course, now that you know, it won’t exactly be a discreet matter for much longer, now will it?” Momomi noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  Kiyashiki-san. Information is power, you know. And like power, it’s not  smart to spread it around without careful consideration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, that explains everything.” Amiki smirked. “Well, enjoy that. I’ll be sparring away happily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever.”  Kaname closed her eyes and walked away. “I’ll see you guys later. Oh,  that reminds me… Momomi, can you meet me by the lake after you’ve done  your think with Olesa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The lake?” Momomi’s brow wrinkled. “Why not our room?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just trust me. It has to be the lake.” Kaname walked off without another word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  smirked some more, then turned away. “That girl… I won’t get to pummel  her for today, now will I? Well, see you two around. Later, Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d better take my leave as well.” Shion bowed her head briefly. “Good luck, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared after her. “Good luck?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Presumably she has no faith in our scriptwriting abilities,” Olesa observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  was silent for a few moments as they walked towards the library,  frowning and deep in thought. Then she spoke again. “Just what was all  that about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something between you and Kenjou.” Olesa shrugged in complete indifference. “Nothing relevant to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly,  you could be more considerate, you know.” Momomi pouted. “This is the  sort of thing friends discuss, you know. She’s been acting oddly  recently and it’s starting to worry me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t waste too  much effort on worrying. Kenjou is a robust personality. Besides, it  sounds like if there’s anything she is worried about, she has it well  in hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right.” Momomi frowned. “I suppose that’s it,  too. She probably has something more to say about the Amane thing.  Though why it has to be the lake, I’ve got no idea…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps she intends to propose a watersports club,” Olesa suggested, with just a hint of irony.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  say that, you’ll make it so. That’s hardly out of character for her.”  Momomi frowned. “Actually, that’s not even such a bad idea. We have a  huge, beautiful lake but we don’t make good use of it at all. It just  sits there looking pretty. Getting some activities on there would be a  good plan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose rowing and so on are considered men’s  sports.” Olesa closed her eyes. “Our football and rugby teams, for  example, are hardly proactive. But everything elegant, from archery to  tea ceremony, is practised here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would annoy Kaname as  well. All the more reason to change things, she’d say, or something  like that. But it’s not like there’s no precedent.” Momomi shrugged.  “Kendo, for example. Running at people with a sword is hardly ladylike.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  it is somewhat consistent to the tradition of the female samurai  aristocracy of ages gone by,” Olesa said. “Kariya and her like spring  from there, in some cases, or at the very least pretend to that  heritage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I know. If you’re going to get technical, the tanto and the naginata were more common women’s arms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. Kariya prefers the sword, though. Certainly, kendo has a larger  pool of support here than many other clubs, but much of that is based  on Kariya’s preference and skill. It makes others desire to be  involved.” Olesa looked out over the forest. “That may well end when  she leaves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have a point. But still, that proves in itself we can do male-dominated sports if it’s <em>cool </em>to do so.” Momomi frowned. “Wait, why are we talking about this? This doesn’t have anything to do with anything!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa just chuckled softly. “You do have a short attention span. That’s not my fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi puffed out her cheeks exaggeratedly and said nothing. <em>It’s  fun to act like a child around Olesa. If only Amane did that with  Kaname, my life would be a lot easier. Somehow, though, I think you’d  have to pay Amane before she pouted. Well, not even that. It’s not like  she needs the money.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They entered the oppressive silence of  the library, picking their way through the shelves. Of course, when she  said oppressive silence, she meant it was mostly that. You could  generally see and hear a couple making out if you walked around for  long enough, but that wasn’t relevant. Dismissing her flippant  thoughts, Momomi sat opposite Olesa and searched through her bag for  what she’d done so far. “So we’ll carry on from where we left off?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  just nodded. She watched as Momomi placed her books on the table, then  got to work in silence. They stayed like that for a few minutes,  highlighting bits of text, checking words in the dictionary and saying  nothing but clipped questions and answers. But after a while, Momomi  noticed that her companion had stopped writing and was tapping her pen  against the desk. “What’s up? Stuck with a word?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa just shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever.” Momomi shrugged and got back to work, then spotted Olesa looking at her absently. <em>This has been a bad day for that. </em>“What’s up now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa frowned, looking uncertain for a moment, then put her pen down. “Can I ask you a personal question, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Of course. You know all about me anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who’s the most important person in the world to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “What brought this on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve been thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As if that’s an answer…</em>Momomi sighed. “You don’t make things easy for me, do you?” She closed her eyes for a moment, thinking. <em>Well, I hate my father, Araldo’s okay, I dislike my mother at times and like her in others, I like my sister, and then…well…</em>”Probably Kaname. Though if I say that, it makes me sound like a failure of a child.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  shook her head. “The love between two equals is stronger than family.  Many western societies, at least, work along those lines. It isn’t  unusual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, I’m thirteen and she doesn’t even like me  back. That makes me feel rather less noble. I suspect I’m just being an  over-dramatic teenager.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “But still… well, don’t tell anyone I said that. Least of all her. It’s embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She already knows, I think. And she thinks the same thing about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  blushed and decided to change the subject. “Whatever. But why did you  ask all of a sudden? There must have been a reason, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shook her head awkwardly. “It was just a point of curiosity. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi leaned forwards. “The hell it was. Come on, tell me… no, wait. Who is <em>your </em>most important person?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To her surprise, Olesa blushed deeply and said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aha.” Momomi leaned back again, smirking. “So that’s what this is about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  looked down at the table, fingers tracing little circles on the desk.  “Don’t get any funny ideas. It’s just something I’ve been thinking  about. But for someone like me, my raison d’être is my mother. There  isn’t any doubt about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. I wonder… is a raison d’être  the same thing as a most important person?” Momomi smiled when her  friend’s eyes flickered uncertainly. “Well, I’m just thinking out loud.  But it sounds to me like things would be pretty awkward, if the two  weren’t one and the same. That’s the sort of dilemma that makes you  question your path in life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some things may be transient, and  some things are life goals,” Olesa replied, looking down at her play.  “The two are completely separate.” Her eyes weren’t moving.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it could be argued that if they are different, that’s indication that  you need to rethink your path. It’s not like you need to be wedded to a  single goal forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone like that would be a very fickle person.” Olesa’s voice was quiet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I’m not someone who’d make that argument. It’s too complicated.” Momomi  smiled. “Take everything, want for nothing. But just because you have  something to achieve at the end of the day, that doesn’t preclude you  from enjoying your life day by day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa frowned. “It’d be irresponsible to become distracted and forget what you have to do. I hate people like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. But you can still do both. Hell, having a good source of  relaxation and fulfilment will help you with any goal.” Momomi smirked.  “That’s what I think, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what happens when they  contradict each other?” Olesa asked, looking at her. “Suppose that for  the sake of the reason to live you have to leave here. But you know  that your important person wants to stay here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned.  “That’s a different question. But I’d ask first, which does the person  want do? The one in-between. Her opinions are important too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d  disagree on that, but never mind.” Olesa closed her eyes. “She wants to  stay, but she also wants to go. Because she knows her mother is unhappy  when she’s here, but her friend is happy here. And she herself would  miss either, whichever she chose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a tough choice, but it  isn’t one I can be expected to answer.” Momomi folded her arms. “If you  ask me, she’s taking herself too seriously. She should talk to the  mother and… friend, so you say, and explain the situation. Let them  decide. She shouldn’t take it upon herself to determine things on her  own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa smiled. “She’s been doing that for a very long time, you know. She’s very used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  problem is that if the two are good to her, they’ll let her decide  anyway. But that’s not the point. She should still ask them first. Then  she can decide.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa laughed. “How… paradoxical. But I do take your point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s one thing I don’t understand. Why now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before,  I used to think that for everything gained, something must be lost. I  used to believe that sacrificing my mother’s feelings was necessary for  my mother’s greater good.” Olesa sighed. “Your shounen hero ideals has  made my life a lot more complicated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “My what what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry. Something Amane told me about. On top of that, you’ve given us…  never mind. Something important.” Olesa stretched. “I don’t even know  why I’m mentioning this to you anyway. Its not like you can tell me the  answer, I know everything about this and I’m as smart as you and I’m  not sure of the right decision to make.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s really opened up, for once. The old Olesa would sooner spit in my eye than confide in me…</em>Momomi smiled gently. “Sometimes people need to think aloud with someone standing near them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.  Well, I’ll bear that in mind the next time you’re in a hissy fit over  Kaname.” Olesa closed her eyes again. “In any case. Shall we carry on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Momomi replied. She knew when it’d be stupid to push her luck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  she’d expected, Olesa had rapidly retreated into her shell again, and  business had returned to normal. But they’d worked productively and  well together, finishing the first act with a couple of minutes to  spare. Momomi nodded and set her pen aside. “Well, that’ll do for now,  won’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Olesa didn’t look up; it was like she was being even colder than usual to compensate for the thaw.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  started to return her books to her bag. “In any case, I’d better get  going, if I’m going to make that random meeting with Kaname. I hope she  survived an hour with Serané…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa just nodded vaguely, returning her own books to her bag.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted and stood, brushing herself off and turning away. “See you later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I was you, I’d turn up five minutes late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stopped and frowned. “What? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Punishment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted and rolled her eyes. “Yeah, that’s very convincing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s a form, you know. Social expectations should be fulfilled, and a man should wait.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  walked off without another word, shaking her head at Olesa’s madness.  She stayed like that until she was halfway down the path to the  library, when something clicked in her head. Then she panicked.</span></p>
