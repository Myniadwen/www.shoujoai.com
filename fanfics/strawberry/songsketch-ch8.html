<h1>A Song and a Sketch (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a>

<a href="../strawberry/songsketch-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>They woke up the next morning, with nothing but Tsubomi&#39;s sketches 
covering their bodies. Tsubomi began peeling the drawings off Yaya&#39;s 
body - with her teeth. Looking down at the older woman lying trapped 
between her legs, Tsubomi grinned.

&quot;You know something? Undressing you is so much more fun that dressing 
you.&quot;

Yaya had shut her up then by sitting up and nuzzling her breasts. 
Tsubomi gasped, reflexively locking her legs around the older woman&#39;s 
waist. Eventually, Yaya&#39;s wandering hands found themselves between&#39;s 
Tsubomi&#39;s thighs, followed quickly by the older woman&#39;s mouth. The 
pink-haired girl moaned and rocked in time with Yaya&#39;s thrusts, before 
arching and shuddering a final time. Tsubomi allowed her heartbeat to 
settle into a more life-sustaining pace, before using a judo move to 
flip a pleasantly surprised Yaya onto her back.

&quot;And just what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; The black-haired beauty asked 
Tsubomi, a smile on her slightly swollen lips.

&quot;Showing you that my mouth&#39;s good for other things besides talking.&quot;

They passed the next several hours indulging in Tsubomi&#39;s 
demonstrations.

~~~~~

&quot;I got a Valentine&#39;s Day letter from Hikari-senpai.&quot;

Yaya looked up distractedly from her music sheet.

&quot;What&#39;s it say?&quot;

&quot;Lots of things...&quot; Tsubomi skimmed rapidly through the page. After that 
first full day of lovemaking, both she and Yaya had suddenly remembered 
Hikari and had rushed back to Yaya&#39;s apartment. But the blonde woman had 
left without leaving a note. The letter was the first time Tsubomi had 
heard from her since.

&quot;It says that she and Amane-sama patched things up when she got back. It 
was a misunderstanding after all. The other woman had attacked 
Amane-sama, so it wasn&#39;t a consensual kiss. There&#39;s a bunch of other 
stuff about her life at school and all.&quot; Tsubomi paused. &quot;Oh, here, she 
told me to give you a message. &#145;Tell Yaya-chan that I&#39;m sorry...and that 
I&#39;m happy for her. She&#39;s very lucky to have you.&#39;&quot;

Yaya looked faintly annoyed. &quot;Lucky? Why am I the one who&#39;s lucky?&quot;

Tsubomi laughed wickedly before insinuating herself into Yaya&#39;s lap. 
&quot;Well, for starters,&quot; she whispered, while nibbling Yaya&#39;s ear, &quot;I can&#39;t 
think of any other up-and-coming jazz band lead singers who&#39;d have their 
own personal fashion consultant and sex slave.&quot;

Yaya began to unbutton Tsubomi&#39;s shirt. &quot;Lest you get too sassy, let me 
remind you that there&#39;s a queue for that last post; and that you&#39;ve 
already met five of the applicants.&quot;

Tsubomi gasped as a slender hand cupped her right breast. &quot;Tell you 
what,&quot; the younger woman breathed into Yaya&#39;s ear, &quot;Why don&#39;t I show you 
again what else I can do with my sassy tongue and then maybe you&#39;ll make 
mine a permanent position.&quot;

They spent the rest of the day (weeks, months, years?) agreeably 
arguing.

Chapter End Notes:
I know, I know, the sex in the last chapter was gratuitous. But seeing 
as to how everyone else in the series had had their fun long before, I 
thought the two in this story deserved it. Anyway, thanks for reading 
this and hope you enjoyed it. And, of course, if you can spare the time 
and energy, reviews and feedback would be greatly appreciated.</pre>
