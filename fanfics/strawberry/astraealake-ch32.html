<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">I feel bad  about Rodrigo. I wrote a fanfiction aiming to provide depth for the  one-dimension antagonists of Stopani, and ended up with a one-dimension  antagonist who doesn't even have hot lesbian sex... his best defence is  that he'd be a good man a hundred and fifty years ago, but even that  doesn't hold water in light of the adultery thing. So I'm coming up  with a plan of action for his character, but suggestions are welcome.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“For the last time, boy! You will get out there and see her again! That’s an order!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi winced. <em>He’s shouting again. Wonderful timing.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Such a well-balanced man,” Kaname muttered, making Momomi giggle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo’s  reply was muffled, unsurprisingly, but Rodrigo’s words rang out loud  and clear. “Enough! I told you before, this is a confirmed arrangement,  confirmed and reaffirmed! I won’t accept some blather about her  personality and her nonsense as being enough to get in the way of this.  You two were born for these moments, Araldo! Accept it with dignity!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed and ran on ahead, opening the door without asking. “And you did as much, father?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo turned on her, infuriated but without surprise. “That has nothing to do with this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When you made a romantic marriage yourself… there should be limits to your hypocrisy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, so I made a romantic marriage… and we all know how well that turned out, now don’t we!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yukaho  made a shocked sound. Momomi felt something in her snap and she stepped  forwards, fury coursing through her veins. “That’s right! We all know  how that turned out! And that’s all your bloody fault, so why the hell  should we trust your recommendations for our marriages?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  stepped forwards instantly, eyes narrowed. Momomi instinctively stepped  back, folding her arms over her body defensively. “Don’t you dare step  in here and insult your own father about a matter that doesn’t concern  you in company! Not a word more, or so help me god you will come to  regret it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Father, please… there’s a guest present,” Luigia said softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  don’t you defend her all the time, either! You’ve been doing that far  too much in recent times!” Rodrigo looked around the room, his face  locked into a scowl. No one met his eyes. “I will have discipline in my  family. I will not accept you saying anything you please and blackening  the name of the Phareli in front of strangers. Is that implicitly  understood?” He glared at Momomi. She glared back, then looked down.  Finally, his gaze settled on Kaname. “You should leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Talkative, aren’t you?” Kaname quipped, meeting his gaze evenly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t know why she’s chosen to grace us with her presence, but it has nothing to do with you. Please leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  stared at him for a few moments longer, arms folded, then stepped back  when Momomi nodded slightly. “I’ll be outside. Bear that in mind.” She  turned and closed the door behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ridiculous,” Rodrigo  growled, looking around. He was talking in Italian, presumably to  exclude Kaname listening in. “This whole situation is ridiculous. I  slave away for months, endless meetings, social functions, negotiation,  all to find a fitting match for my nephew. And I find a pearl- a pearl-  of a girl, an only heir of noble birth, excellent manners, great beauty  and considerable wealth… in all matters, in every particular, a perfect  example of flowering womanhood! And this is the thanks I get.” He  glared at them all again, his gaze dominating the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi scowled. <em>What kind of idiot talks about flowering womanhood anyway? I mean, Christ, that’s worse than Victorian.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  have suffered through a lot these past few days from you all,” Rodrigo  continued. “But I’m at the end of my patience. I am the head of this  family. I will not be contradicted by my wife, a nephew, and least of  all my ungrateful, immature daughters. Mature twenty years and I will  have time for your opinions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Dear, please, the children only want to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yukaho backed down instantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo looked at them yet again. Momomi had forgotten this. <em>Those  few terrible moments when he breaks out from his shell of apathy and  dominates a whole room like this. The head of the family, our master, a  law unto himself. Respect him or suffer. I’d almost managed to drive  that from my memory, but it’s my home life. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Actually, I’m  glad you’re here, Momomi, because it means I can lay things on the  line,” Rodrigo barked. “I don’t know what kind of discipline they teach  you in this school, but I will not accept your disrespect! I am your  father and if you are not mature enough to show proper deference I will  drag you home and beat it into you, just like my father did to me in my  turn!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi felt rage explode inside her chest, a rising force that could so easily suffocate her. <em>I swear, if I had a knife right now I’d stab him through and damn the consequences.</em> <em>Just  like that bastard before him…when I moved with desperation and the  knife plunged into him and he looked so shocked as he collapsed, blood  seeping into the floor. That time, I was scared out of my mind and in  tears. But I swear, I could kill my father and feel nothing but a vague  sense of satisfaction. That’s just a stupid dream, though. In the real  world, I can’t say a word. Because, impossibly, I need this man.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Luigia,  you’re the same. I’m very disappointed in you. She’s always been a bad  influence on your behaviour, but that’s no excuse; your conduct of late  has been atrocious, a disgrace to your status as heir to the Phareli.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  can only offer my deepest, most heartfelt apologies, father,” Luigia  said, with just a hint of sarcasm. “If I offended you, it was only  because I felt I needed to speak to defend the best interests of the  family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You are but a child, you have no right to speak so  emphatically on those best interests. Bear that in mind!” But he  appeared pleased with the reply all the same.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yukaho smiled weakly. “Rodrigo, darling, do we have to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Silence! I’m disciplining the children, Yukaho. You may not be able to do so but my God, I will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now,  Araldo!” Rodrigo turned his gaze onto an already trembling boy. “I am  especially disappointed in you. The Diralna girl is a perfect match.  Give me one flaw, one real flaw, in her! Don’t give me this guff about  incompatible personalities, a man plays with the cards dealt him! You  wouldn’t know the first thing about a relationship anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, there’s one thing, father,” Araldo said shakily, taking a breath. “And even I know it could cause relationship problems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo merely narrowed his eyes challengingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’s… she’s… I mean, she’s <em>gay, </em>father,” Araldo stammered. “However, you look at it-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  kicked the coffee table hard, jarring the glasses placed there. The boy  fell silent instantly. “Not this nonsense again! I told you before,  that isn't anything we have to worry about. The Diralna know and they  agree with me! I’m sick of hearing about this blasted girl’s  perversions as if they’re some kind of excuse!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No  buts!” Rodrigo drew himself up, then relaxed with a visible effort. “I  understand your concern, boy, and it’s healthy. Any Christian gentleman  should have doubts before dealing with such women. But there’s no  reason to shun her for it. It is a phase she will grow out of, indeed  you will help her out of it. With effort, the guidance and support of  those who care about her, and a Christian marriage, I’ve no doubt that  she’ll overcome that. I’d go so far as to say we’ve a duty to help her.  And I’ve seen it before. Isn’t that right, Yukaho? Aren’t there cases  like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yukaho nodded. “Most immediately was my nephew  Gousuke. The poor boy had a very confused adolescence, just like  Serané-chan, but when his parents brought him into a settled, proper  relationship he became much better. They even have children now. He’s  far from the only one I can think of off the top of my head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“See?” Rodrigo said triumphantly. “That’s your answer, do you see?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo frowned. “I don’t-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  you must be strong, Araldo.” Rodrigo folded his arms, apparently  relaxing into his monologue phase. “Of course she’s going to present  her feelings as legitimate, and she believes they are so. No one  condemns her for it, she’s like someone with an illness. They may have  very fixed ideas about themselves, but we know we have to press on and  cure them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>That word! That word! I win my bet! </em>Momomi closed her eyes and bit her lip, trying to block out his words. <em>If  I don’t listen, I can keep my calm. Keep my calm and I have a chance of  staying here and exploring my own feelings and self. Just hold on. Just  this once.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’ll try and manipulate you, she’ll try and  present you as an intrusion, she may even turn on you in anger and  frustration, but you must press on regardless.” Rodrigo’s voice was  brimming with absolute conviction. “And if she’s difficult, press on  all the harder. Remember, she considers this Kariya her life partner,  the poor child. If she’s faithful to that false love she’ll be true to  you in due course, once you’ve won her over. That harder this is, the  better this will be for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know this is very hard,  darling,” Yukaho said quietly. “And I feel for her as well, it’s a  painful matter. But you have to understand this is for her own good.  Her parents arranged this match precisely because they’re worried about  her, and they’re counting on you to help her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo made no reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Out of impotent disbelief, or out of doubt? Which, I wonder? </em>Momomi scowled. <em>No,  it doesn’t matter. If you can’t take action intention is worthless.  That’s what Olesa said, and it’s true of him right now. And of me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  like I said, boy, you have to be strong,” Rodrigo continued. “It’s for  her own good, just like Yukaho said. If your resolve ever wavers,  remember the teachings of Our Lord. More than that, remember simple  common sense. However legitimate it looks, there cannot be a natural  romantic love between girl and girl! It’s a sin against God and against  nature, and I want you to remember both those things. But we’re  Christian, Araldo, we forgive and ask for God’s forgiveness. That’s why  I want you to do this, for her and for us and for you. Do you  understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even… even if you say that,” Araldo said. “I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What?” Rodrigo sighed. “Araldo, please… I told you before. She’s a very disturbed girl and you need to be strong for her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Stop it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo’s head snapped round. “Luigia!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  won’t take it back!” And suddenly, Momomi’s sister was on her.  “Whatever’s the case… whatever your beliefs… whatever the truth is…  don’t say those things! Not in front of-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m telling the simple truth, Luigia! Don’t you dare contradict me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  I’m telling your you’re wrong!” Luigia gritted her teeth, and this time  she spoke in Japanese, to annoy her father. “Look, I don’t like  homosexuality either, and I know it’s a sin. But more and more, I know,  it won’t go away if we ignore it, and we can’t cure it. People have to  bear that burden their whole lives and we should respect them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  walked forwards, taking three swift steps, then slapped her so hard so  almost fell over. “You’re hysterical! I won’t tolerate this kind of  behaviour, Luigia!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Luigia took a step back, a hand on her cheek,  eyes wide with shock. “I just… I… I’m sorry,” she managed eventually.  “But that’s what I believe. Serané-chan will have to live with herself  her whole life. I’m praying for her to realise her sin and achieve  God’s forgiveness, but she’ll always be like that. Forcing her into a  loveless marriage won’t help at all, least of all before she’s  acknowledged her sin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo’s eyes narrowed. “I see… well,  it’s a perspective. You’re too passionate, Luigia, but if that’s all  I’ll consider this matter closed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not closed,” Luigia  managed. “Because you haven’t taken your words back. I won’t let you  call it an illness, and I won’t let you talk about a cure!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why,  you-” He slapped her again, making Yukaho gasp. He ignored the sound.  “Impudent! Don’t be so stubborn! What’s a matter of semantics to you,  anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not just semantics, it’s real people.” Luigia gave  Momomi a beseeching glance, begging silently for her support, her  explanation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Don’t look at me with those eyes. Please don’t  look at me with those eyes. Because I can’t say a word. I have  something I have to do, so I can’t say a word. </em>Momomi looked away, feeling sick to the stomach. <em>You’re  defending me again, but I can’t. I can’t fight. It’s at times like this  when I really do hate the realities of this world.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, in  any case,” Rodrigo said, collecting himself slightly. “We can’t force  her to do anything against her will. This is a modern age, after all.”  He sounded like he vaguely resented both these facts. “But I expect you  to press on all the same, Araldo. Understood?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s still-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes,” Araldo said miserably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>I  recognise that look. It’s his puppy with a crushed foot look when  someone’s run him over. Normally, I’d scoff or kick him verbally, but  right now I’ve been even more of a walkover. It can’t be helped, can  it, Araldo? This is the reality of the world. </em>Momomi felt her fists clench to the point where she was hurting herself. <em>We have to obey a mad tyrant absolutely because of an accident of biology.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  he succeeds, he succeeds. If he fails, he fails. But it’s far too early  for him to try and duck out on some mumbled half-excuses. And I still  have faith that she can change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wish I could believe that,” Luigia whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We could have a bet on the outcome, actually. I’d put my money on Araldo curing her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Darling, please!” Yukaho looked upset. “You’re being vulgar. You shouldn’t talk about those things in that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It was just a joke, woman,” Rodrigo said irritably. “I’m trying to lighten the tone, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You could be a little more tasteful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  that’s a settled matter. I want you to go to her again and have lunch  with her.” Rodrigo frowned. “This really isn’t the environment, though,  not with that Kariya brat running around and the whole ambience of the  place. Perhaps us coming here was a mistake, as well. Ah, that’s it…  you could offer to take her to the town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think she’d accept, though.” Araldo looked at the floor in a depressed way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Have  some confidence, boy. That’s the important thing. A man must have  conviction. When you ask her, don’t stutter or mumble. Make it clear  that you don’t even anticipate the possibility that she will reject  you. You have to take the initiative, and take charge, it’s what women  like in a man.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You should listen to this, Araldo,” Momomi said  sarcastically. “He knows what he’s talking about.” Well, she couldn’t  resist an opening like that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That reminds me,” Rodrigo said, turning to look at her casually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Now  he’s in his condescending mode, when he feels that he’s properly  asserted his authority and he can afford to take some crap. In some  ways I prefer it when he gets livid at my every word. </em>“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I was wondering why you’d turned up here so early. Not just to butt into other people’s business, I presume?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Dear!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  the fact is, I had something to talk to you all about,” Momomi said  awkwardly. She couldn’t meet his eyes and it was getting harder to  force herself to do this. <em>Well, at least I look sufficiently  deferent. But I’m still as tired as hell by all this, and, I’ll admit  it, a little intimidated as well.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then sit down. Let’s get this over with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  sat; he remained standing, of course, it was one of the ways he used to  maintain the psychological advantage. Unsubtle but effective. “Well,  you know, you were planning to withdraw me from this school… I was  wondering whether you might want to reconsider that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh?” He quirked his eyebrows and smiled slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Playing with me, is it? You bastard. </em>She  closed her eyes briefly, collecting herself. “It may sound odd, but  I’ve rather taken root here. I have good friends and I enjoy the club  activities. I enjoy the culture here as well. The overall academic  standard is excellent and I’d hate to have to leave after my time here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now,  Momomi, we know all those things, but we still think it’s best if the  family is back together. I don’t want us to become more distant.”  Yukaho smiled the way she did, with a slight hint of worrisome doubt  alongside her happiness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, let’s hear her out. Was there anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  appreciate mother’s concern, but I can visit during the summer  holidays,” Momomi said. “And I do have friends here, like I said, who  will probably be lost when I go regardless. That happened to one of my  senpais here, and she was very saddened by it. I know the term fees  aren’t cheap but I’ve been planning to sit the scholarship exam. If I  get that, you won’t have to pay anything. Besides, it’s probably  cheaper than private tutors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I hope you don’t think that  expense is my main concern in educating my children, Momomi. I want  what is best for you, no matter the cost.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know, father,”  Momomi said, forcing a smile. “I just thought I’d be thorough about  this. The school has a faultless reputation and long traditions, a very  supportive environment, and many socially known peers. I know for a  fact that some of the biggest names in Japanese aristocracy attend  here, and it’s international as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s true enough,” Yukaho said. “Do you know anyone in particular, Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  there’s Amane Ohtori in my year. She’s only a relative of the main  family, but it’s still a valuable connection. Then there’s Shizuma  Hanazono and Miyuki Rokujō, in the year above us, Juri Kawaguchi in  third year, Serané Diralna and Kariya Nakano themselves above that, and  the twins Wakiko and Wakako Enomoto in sixth year. Not to mention Kei  Kurita and Sarah Walker in the year below me. And that’s just what you  might call the A-list.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Impressive. Astraea hasn’t changed at  all in that respect, it always has been a place for the social elite.”  Yukaho nodded approvingly. “I made many valuable friends and  acquaintances there myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So these are important people?” Rodrigo asked, momentarily disarmed. He’d never taken much interest in such things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“These are the daughters of excellent families. All of them are as much as or even more prodigious than the Phareli.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo grunted, displeased with the very idea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi relished a slight sense of triumph. <em>Thank you, the amazing stalker senpai. </em>“That’s  another reason to stay, isn’t it? I’m not the first child or anything  like that, but I can make important contacts here. It’s more useful  than keeping me cooped up and useless, another daughter to marry off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo closed her eyes. “That’s true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As far as it goes,” he finished, glancing at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned slightly. “As far as it goes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Certainly  it’s a better place for you to be for all that stuff, even I could see  that,” Rodrigo said. “Your mother’s always taken more interest in it  than me, of course. But all the same, I don’t intend to keep you here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What? Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t like the ethos, it’s not suited for a noble daughter,” Rodrigo  explained, as if this was the most natural objection in the world.  “It’s undisciplined and your behaviour has become even worse since I  sent you here, which was the exact opposite of my intention. And the  Etoiles, supposed figureheads for the school, are even worse from that  perspective.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re not undisciplined, it’s pretty harsh,  actually. Besides, we learn independence as well as obedience. That’s  for the best, isn’t it? Those Etoiles, both, they’re heirs to their  families, so they have to be strong!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you’re not a heir,” Rodrigo pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  not the point!” Momomi bit her lip. “Isn’t it better if I’m able to  stand and support the family and my sister on my own two feet, not rely  on you all the time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Again, that’s good as far as it goes, but  it comes at the price of your poor behaviour, and an erosion of your  family duty.” Rodrigo folded his arms. “I don’t blame you for that,  sending you here might have been a mistake. But when you spent months  away from your family at a time, it’s inevitable that bonds will  weaken. You’ve forgotten your responsibilities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What kind of  family unity falls apart because I’m away for so much time in a year?”  Momomi demanded. “I’m still loyal to the Phareli, and you, father. That  hasn’t changed. I still love you all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re a bad liar.”  Rodrigo laughed gruffly. “Besides that, it’s inevitable for me to have  concerns. Yukaho’s told me a lot about the position of Etoile and its  importance, calling it a credit to Diralna-san. But it’s a disturbing  thing when that goes to a deviant couple. I have no faith in the  school’s leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The Etoiles are democratically elected,” Momomi replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Isn’t  that even worse? Both that they were elected and that the Superior  permitted it? This school has a terribly lax attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked at the floor, her hair falling over her eyes for a moment. “So that’s it, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m sure you understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>They  warned me. That our agendas might end up conflicting with each other.  As it is, though, neither of us are close to a resolution and I’m still  screwed. </em>“No, actually,” she said, her voice heavy. “I really don’t understand that at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, it’s a settled matter, as far as I’m concerned. You’re going  back to Italy with us. That’s a more proper place for you to be raised  anyway, you’re not Japanese.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No buts. This is settled.” Rodrigo turned away, glancing at Araldo again. “Now, boy, are you going to sit around all day, or-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi leapt to her feet, eyes wide with disbelief. “You can’t do this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I damn well can! Don’t question my authority, girl!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Can’t you just listen to what I have to say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  grunted in annoyance and turned to face her. “I’ve listened. I’m not  interested. I’m not having my daughter attending a school where such  unnatural practises are tolerated. They should have been stopped long  since.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What do you know about that?” Momomi demanded, losing her cool. “What do you now about anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is what I mean! Your impudence has only become worse!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  can’t care about that,” Momomi exclaimed. “All I care about is that I  finally have friends here. The ones I care about. Things I like to do.  People who will look after me and listen to me when I’m upset. It’s not  always easy or welcoming or kind, but I trust my life here! And  Kaname’s here! I won’t leave all that behind, because… I have a home  here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo snorted. “You only have one home, girl, and one family. That’s with us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  felt her anger well up in her, screaming for release. “I won’t dedicate  my whole life to you. I won’t take your orders. I won’t let you tell me  where my home is!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I am your father and you will respect that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You have no right to say that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">There  was a ringing silence and then Rodrigo moved, the sharp, decisive way  he did when someone was about to be slapped. Momomi stepped back but  kept her eyes on him. Then she spoke in Japanese. “It doesn’t matter  what I say, does it? You’ve already decided it all inside that thick  skull of yours, thinking you control my life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Momomi!” Yukaho exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sister, you’re going too far,” Luigia said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No,  I don’t care now,” Momomi spat, feeling everything she’d kept inside  exploding out. “I’ll say it all, and I’ll lay it all on the line.  Because this man is an egotistical prick who knows nothing about  anything, and he’ll never let me do what I want to do. But you can’t  stop me from saying what I damn well please!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t count on it!” Rodrigo snapped, infuriated. “I’ll beat that into you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  moved behind the sofa to provide her with some space. “That’s right,  come and beat the crap out of me if you feel like it! I’m used to that!  Beat me until I’m bleeding on the floor, just like before! But you have  to shut me up because I’m contradicting your pathetic patriarchy! I  could care less if you were my father! My god, but I wish I was born to  anyone but you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">He advanced on her, eyes blazing like coals. “So  this is the thanks I get for trying to look after my pathetic second  daughter. You’re a waste of space yourself, you don’t know the first  thing about anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s my line! You’re so ignorant I  don’t know where to begin!” Momomi raised her voice until she was  making herself hoarse. “But I’ll start here… what you think about gays,  you’re a fucking naïve narrow-minded bigoted twat who’s clueless beyond  belief and thinks he’s absolutely right! Not because of any real  reasons, but because you’re and because a stupid book about a God that  doesn’t exist written thousands of years ago happens to spare a few  sentences on it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Momomi!” Yukaho snapped, shocked beyond belief. “Take that back! I won’t let you say those things in this family!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No,  let her speak.” Rodrigo had passed through the heat of his anger and  was now in the lagoon of cold rage. “She can say what she likes. I’ll  beat every inch of her in proportion to her words now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I  don’t fear you any more,” Momomi snapped. “Even if you hurt me, you  won’t touch my mind, and the truths I know. You won’t get anywhere with  Serané, and do you know why? She’s gay, through and through, and it  won’t go away. She can’t love Araldo and she loves Kariya. Whatever it  takes, however much it hurts her, she won’t bow to you or her own  family alike. Not just for Kariya. Do you know why? That’s who she is.  If you can’t accept that, she’ll just have to walk away, because it’s  impossible to exist in a family that doesn’t accept your fundamental  self.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re naïve at best, Momomi,” Rodrigo spat. “There’s  nothing fundamental about some deviancy she’s taken upon herself at a  whim! She’s a freak now but she’ll never have the courage or the will  to stick to the course. That sickly emotion won’t keep her from the  family who truly loves her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why can’t she defy her family? I  can, I am and I will, and I don’t even have a sickly love, a love  that’s far more true than anything you ever felt in your life!” Momomi  folded her arms over her body, trying to stave off the tears. “But I’m  the same as her! I don’t have any reason to hide it any more!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you blathering about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She knows,” Momomi snapped, pointing at Luigia. “And Araldo can guess. Can’t you see it for yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  glanced at Luigia, but she just looked at the floor, shoulders shaking.  “What meaningless melodrama are you falling on now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not meaningless, it’s who I am. I’m gay too and that won’t change, not for you and not for anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you saying?” Yukaho asked, looking horrified. “Momomi, you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  saying I like girls,” Momomi said. “Now listen carefully, because I’ll  only say this once. Ever since I’ve been aware, it’s been of girls, and  ever since them I’ve watched them and dreamed of them, smiled at them  and thought of them, the way another girl isn’t meant to. And now  there’s a girl I like, I really like, and I want to learn to love her.  I want to hold her hand and hug her and date her and even kiss her, I  want to know her as well as myself, I want to be happy with her besides  me. And perhaps one day I’ll want to share my bed with her. That’s who  I am, that’s what I dream of.” She was crying now, she could feel it.  “It won’t change, even if you hate me. So I’ll just hate you right  back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re lying,” Rodrigo said flatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed, even though his words where stabbing her in the chest. “Sorry. I’m not. This is how I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s you’d go this far to spite me… you really are disgusting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There’s  no spite, it’s not like I want this! I…” Momomi wiped her face  distractedly, feeling the tears warm against her cheek. “If even sis is  ashamed of me, it’s more than I can bear. But I’m like this, it won’t  change, and I won’t be ashamed of myself. I won’t hate myself or lie  for your convenience, father, you or anyone else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I won’t  permit that immorality in my own flesh and blood,” Rodrigo warned. “I  tolerated the Diralna girl’s perversions because she’s been denied  proper guidance, but I won’t let you be the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  are you going to do? Cure me? You think you have that godlike power?”  Momomi managed a smile. “Or are you just going to beat me and beat me  until I have no spirit left, and throw me to some guy when you’re  through. I’ll pretend to be a perfect housewife, and suffer the pains  of sleeping with him, even though I’ll never feel anything for him and  he’ll gain more satisfaction than screwing a mattress. Like that? Is  that the Christian way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Little girls shouldn’t talk about  things they don’t understand, least of all when they don’t understand  themselves. I don’t know whether you think this is cool or rebellious  or edgy and new or whatever, or whether you sincerely believe this  crap, but I won’t have it my presence!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s fine! I’ll always  be like this, so just send me from your presence. It’s been a long time  since I could call you father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How dare you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But, you  know, I can just do things your way!” Momomi said, cutting over him.  She felt almost hysterical now and it was coming out in her voice.  “I’ll pretend I’m a good Christian and take the beating and marry the  guy, then I’ll go out and sleep with every hot girl I can lay my hands  on! That’s what you do!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shut up! You’ve gone too far this time, you little whore!” Rodrigo began to pull his belt off, glaring at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The  only difference is, I won’t get anyone pregnant. And I’ll try my  hardest not to treat my good husband like a piece of shit to be taken  for granted at best and beaten at the worst! I won’t beat my children,  either! I’m a terrible person, you made me that, but I’m still better  than you’ll ever be!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo walked forwards but suddenly Luigia  was there, blocking his way. “That’s enough, father!” Her face was  cold. “Don’t go any further!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You, too, Luigia? You disappoint me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I won’t let you touch her. Because she’s right. She’s right! Serané, her, you, all of it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  hit her across the face with his belt, drawing blood. “I can’t believe  I spent sixteen years on you for this reward! You’re both disgraceful!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi backed away, fear wide in her eyes. “Sister, get out of the way! He’ll hurt you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Luigia turned to face her, blood dripping down her cheek. “Momomi, I’m not ashamed of you. You’re stronger than I’ll ever be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She  really does corrupt you,” Rodrigo said, sighing. “I thought you were a  good and moral girl, Luigia, but it looks like you’ll tolerate any  sinful babble if it comes from her lips. You spoil her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You misunderstand her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">He  shoved her out of his way, walking towards Momomi, but she turned and  grabbed his arm. He made to throw her off with his other hand, but  someone else gripped it. He turned, snarling, to see Araldo looking up  defiantly. “So this is where you show your true colours!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  won’t let you lay a hand on her, not here and now,” Araldo said, voice  shaking slightly. “Because I’m… I’m what you taught me to be. A  Christian gentleman. Please act that way too, uncle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s enough, dear!” Yukaho shook her head. “This isn’t the place and time, so please, can we deal with this later?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  looked around and scowled deeply, knowing when he was beaten. He closed  his eyes and took several breaths before he continued. “Alright, get  off me. You’re right… this isn’t the place and time. But I will find  that time.” He began to put his belt back on, then opened his eyes and  looked at Momomi. “As for you… run back to your friends. Enjoy their  company when you can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi stated back evenly, despite the terror wracking her body. “You’re no father of mine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you’re no daughter of mine. But I’ll still take responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">There  was nothing more to be said, so she turned and walked through the door.  On the other side, she gasped and fell into Kaname’s arms.</span></p>
