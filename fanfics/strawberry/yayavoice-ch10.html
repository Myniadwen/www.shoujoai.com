<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Hikari: What do I do?</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  Saturday morning and I have just returned to my room from breakfast. I  laid down on my bed, oddly feeling tired. I admit that I’m no morning  person, it took me three or four months before I got used to getting up  on my own so that I didn’t need Yaya-chan to wake me up every morning.  But that wasn’t the reason I felt tired.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We barely get to talk  lately. I was worried when I saw her in her bed, sleeping early again  last Thursday night and with a light fever and a lot of band-aids on  her hands. She was well enough to attend class the next morning… I  wanted to talk to her later that night but… the last I saw of her was  after classes when we split up as I headed to choir practice. When I  returned to our room, I found a letter addressed to me. I soon  discovered that it was from Yaya-chan. I slowly opened the envelope,  almost dreading to read the letter’s contents. But, when I found myself  holding the unfolded paper, with its contents plain for my eyes to see,  I decided to read it… after I took one deep nervous breath. It read:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hikari, </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em> I’m going out for the weekend. Please don’t worry about me, I’ll be  fine. I’ll be back either by Sunday night or in time for class on  Monday. Have a pleasant weekend! I’ll try to bring souvenirs! </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>p.s.  could you roll my thick blanket and put it in my place on the bed  before night fall. Just in case the sister comes to check on us at  night.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>-Yaya</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was relieved at first to know  that she had remembered to write a letter. She tends to sneak out of  school and do this outing of hers every once in a while. She would be  gone for a day, two or the weekend. She’d bring back with her a lot  random souvenirs and share it with me and sometimes the class. And most  times, she’ll come back looking really refreshed and cheerier than when  she had left. She’s always invited me to come with her before, she  always did, even though she knew I would always say that I didn’t want  to sneak out because my parents would get mad if they found out. It was  always a valid excuse, my parents were very protective and strict about  things like this. But oddly she didn’t invite me this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  now, here I am… on my bed… staring at the letter she wrote to me. And  wondering why, I feel so left out that she didn’t bother trying to  invite me this time. … I might have just said; “yes...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I sat up  and looked at Yaya-chan’s side of the room. I could almost see her  there; Sleeping on her bed, studying on her desk, drawing while leaning  on the wall, singing while sitting on the floor, or just simply smiling  at me as she cheers me up. All of which are only but a hand full of my  memories of my best friend. I can’t believe she’s been missing for less  than a day, but I miss her already. What’s wrong with me?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Looking  out the window, I recalled that I didn’t have plans today. I didn’t  make any… not even with Amane-sempai. Actually it’s not that I didn’t  make any. It’s more like my plans were ruined because the person I  wanted and had planned to spend time with had her own plans and  disappeared before I had the chance to invite her to do anything. I let  out a deep sad sigh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I wanted to talk to someone. <em>‘But who could I talk to?...’</em> I pondered on that thought for a while and remembered two people who  might actually be able to help me. They’re somewhat involved in this  already, when they helped Yaya-chan and I get together and make up. And  although they’re not classmates nor were they st. Spica’s students,  they’re really good friends. I got up from my bed and took out a can of  my favorite imported biscuits, that my sister had sent me, from our  small room pantry and headed out the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minutes later… I was  outside their room, on the second floor of the Miator side of the dorm  building. I knocked nervously, having second thoughts about my sudden  visit. But before I could decide on fleeing the door opens revealing a  blue haired girl, in her loose blue pajamas and a white head band that  had something written on it. She looked at me with a happy surprised  face and said;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari-chan! Good Morning!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good Morning.  Tamao-san.” I greeted back, trying to be as cheerful as I can while  still in a semi public area. She might have noticed it, I don’t know  for sure… but I always tend to think that she’s the type that catches  on quickly to hidden signals, even if they’re unconsciously done. I  don’t really know how she does it, but sometimes I can tell when she  does.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiles and asks me to come in. I happily thanked her  and entered. I noticed that Nagisa-chan wasn’t in the room, but that’s  ok. She asked me to take a seat on her bed, to which I nodded and sat  down. I noticed that she was working on something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Were you doing your homework, Tamao-san?” I asked, curious if I’m bothering her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled and showed me what it was. “I’m working on the script, Rokujou-sama asked me to write for the play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was surprised when I remembered it. It was discussed at dinner a few  nights ago. “I’m sorry! I must be bothering you. Maybe I should go.” I  said as I stood up from the bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tamao-chan giggles to my  surprise and wonder. “It’s alright! Hikari-chan. I was having a little  writer’s block anyway. I could use a short break and some biscuits.”  She pointed at the thing in my hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked down and  remembered that I had brought the box of biscuits with me. And with a  silly smile I handed it to her before taking my seat on her bed again.  She headed to the side of the room where there was a small pantry and  an electric water heater where she began to make some tea for us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what do I owe this surprise visit?” She asked me as she was mixing a few tea leaves together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was wondering if you could give me some advice…” I replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  curiously looked at me for a moment, before she said; “I think Yaya-san  knows you a lot better, and would know what to tell you better than I  could.” And looked back to what she was doing so as not to burn herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  looked away from her for a moment, my gaze fell on to Nagisa-chan’s  bed… which coincidentally was on the same side as Yaya-chan’s. It  reminded me of times she sat there as we had our occasional tea parties  here with everyone. “That’s a bit of the problem…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She placed a plate of the biscuits on the desk and offered me a cup.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  said; “Oh? How so? I hear that she could communicate quite well even  with just a pen and paper.” Before pouring herself a cup.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  looked down on the golden brown steaming hot liquid and told her;  “That’s not quite what I mean… she’s also not here at the moment and  she’s part of what I need advice on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” I hear her place  her cup down on her desk. I turned to see that she had opened her  drawer and took what seems to be a plastic sign that said; “Do not  Disturb”. She stands and headed to open the door, on which quickly  hangs the piece of plastic on the door knob and closes it again. She  pulls up her chair closer to me, sits down and asks with a reassuring  smile; “So… what’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I gave myself a few moments to get my  thoughts in order. “I feel like Yaya-chan and I… I mean… I feel like  our friendship isn’t like what it used to be...” I then decided to ask  her; “Tamao-san? Did Yaya-chan tell you anything before we were able to  make up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She seemed surprised that I asked that and asked me  with some curiously as to why I asked. I told her; “I would like to  know…” I paused and waited for her to tell me or simply respond, but  she didn’t. I decided to try to convince her to. “You might have  noticed that though Yaya-chan seems very open, confrontational, loud  and touchy… she also keeps to herself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you saying that she keeps secrets from you?” Tamao-san asks, before taking a sip of her tea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not that she keeps it from me. But I guess you can say that…” I paused  to look towards the window and try to see what was outside. It was  something to help me gather my thoughts. “Yaya-chan has this way of  telling people things to satisfy their curiosity, and sometimes without  actually telling them everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… that’s true…” said  Tamao-san as she place her cup of tea down. “… although at first look,  Yaya-san certainly doesn’t seem like the type of person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” I  felt silent, and took a biscuit but I didn’t bite it yet… I just stared  at it, gazing upon the brownness of the biscuit and the sugar that  formed a glazed look on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-san told me…” Tamao-san paused. I looked at her, happy that she finally decided to answer my question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…That you wouldn’t come.” Her works hit me like a hard slap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” I muttered almost absently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tamao-san  frowned and looked at me straight in the eye. “This is what she said to  me in the back of the church and I quote; “Hikari won’t come. There’s  no way she’ll come here. Hikari… no longer remembers this place,  because… she has a more precious place. And now, I’m no longer her best  friend. Because I ruined our friendship.” end quote. She sounded quite  angry at herself to me, like she was blaming herself very deeply for  what she had done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” I couldn’t say anything after learning  what Yaya-chan and how she had said it. Learning how angry, sad and  hopeless she felt of our breaking friendship troubled me. It was also  painful for me to learn that she was so saddened that she’d think I  would forget the place we had first met. And it brought back memories  of the entranced kiss she gave me that night I came back from the beach  with Amane-sempai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The warmth and forcefulness of her touch, the  glow of her amber eyes, the softness of her lips and the slippery yet  sticky liquid that dared enter my lips from hers. I can almost feel it  as I remember… that night she had just given done that to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  I returned to our room I greeted her quite openly with a harm hug. I  was happy and grateful to her for rescuing me from Kenjo-sempai that  afternoon. I was presenting to her a Sakura shell I found on the beach,  a small token of my deep appreciation for what she had done for me. She  looked happy when I gave it to her… but something happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">… All  of a sudden, the look from her eyes changed. She appeared serious all  of a sudden; she held me arms tightly and pulled me closer to her. And  before I knew it… she was kissing me. I was shocked. And needless to  say I felt hurt and confused. I struggled but Yaya was stronger than me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  slowly pushed forward, and I ended up cornered with the door behind me.  It was then that everything turns for the worse. She began touching me  in places I rather not mention. At that point, I felt that I had to get  her of me. I pushed her away as hard as I could and screamed; “NO!”.  She fell on the floor a few feet from me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I cried and wrapped my  arms around myself. I somehow muttered absently, asking her why she did  that… but in the end I just cried and didn’t give her any chance to  explain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“-chan…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I noticed a hand waving in front of me  and a voice that called; “Hikari-chan?” I turned to see Tamao-san  looking at me rather worriedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! I’m sorry Tamao-san… I spaced out for a bit.” I blushed and apologized to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiles and shakes her head telling me it was ok. “So… might I ask what it was that Yaya-san did?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I looked away and pondered if I should tell her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then told me in a gentle comforting voice; “You don’t have to tell me  Hikari-chan, I can understand that there are things people have to  forget some time in their lives… It’s sometimes necessary too, so that  one can move on, look forward and be or try happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her words  rang in my head… they felt like heavy chains in my heart… and I’m not  quite sure why. However I felt that I will know if I told her what it  was that Yaya did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I shook my head and looked at her. “She… she…”  I found it hard to say. I swallowed, trying to get rid of the anxiety I  felt about the subject.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan… she… kissed me.” I muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  turned my attention back to Tamao-san who remained very quiet before  and after I’ve revealed it to her. I wasn’t so surprise that she looked  very shocked with her mouth wide agape. Which made me wonder if it was  that unbelievable?...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tamao-san?” I called to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A silly  sounding “Huh?” was her only response to my calls. She regained her  composure after a while and apologized for spacing out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-san,  has kissed you huh…” she mumbled as she held her chin with her right  hand. She seemed to be thinking about something and absently added  surgar and stirred her liquid less tea cup. I took it upon myself to  pour her some tea before she decides to drink the sugar as it is.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!… Thank you…” she said as she realized what I did for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  welcome…” I told her and looked at her a little concerned. I felt like  I was really bothering her. She’s busy at this time and she probably  has her own problems to think of and doesn’t need me to make the burden  heavier. I almost wanted to leave and ask her to forget about it… but,  I guess… in a way I’m getting pretty desperate to understand these  things. And to the point I have to selfishly bother another person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari-chan?”  she called me. She sounded like she had gotten her thoughts in order, I  turned to her to see what she has to say. “What do you feel about  Yaya-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I feel about her?” I asked, wondering why she asked such a question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  if you could please be as deeply and honest as possible. I can only  truly tell you what to do once I know.” She sounded absolutely serious.  I found it strange talking to Tamao-san, without a smile on her face.  She’s usually a happy and cheerful person… like… like Yaya-chan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  gaze move onto Nagisa-chan’s bed, just being on that side was enough to  remind of Yaya-chan. Her smile, her playfulness, her protectiveness,  her possessiveness… but there’s one thing I found hard to remember. “…  She’s my best friend and I’m very thankful to her. She’s been with me  for over a year and we’ve been very close. In that time she’s protected  me, encouraged me, and kept me smiling. She’s very important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…”  I hear Tamao-san place down her cup and sighs deeply. “This will be  harder than I thought…” she refills her cup and looks. It was then that  her eyes opened wide as if she was struck by inspiration. “How about…  Amane-sama? What do you feel about her?” she asks before nibbling on  another piece of biscuit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-sempai?...” I blushed and looked  down the floor. I was somehow able to mumble; “I like sempai…” and hope  that answered her question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you like about her?” she followed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It didn’t take me too long to think about it. “She’s cool and beautiful…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that it?” She asked in a rather inquisitive tone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not… Sempai… she makes me smile, she encourages me and she protects me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was surprised to hear Tamao-san laugh softly. I felt a little insulted  because I didn’t tell her my feelings for Amane just so she could  laugh. I pouted a little. “What’s so funny?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tamao-san wipes a tear from her eye and tries to stop laughing… “Hehe… I’m sorry… I didn’t… haha… mean to…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  drank my tea while I waited for her to stop laughing. I could feel my  cheeks warm up, in embarrassment and maybe a little bit in anger.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  picks up her tea cup and takes another sip after she had stopped  laughing. She apologized again for laughing. I told her it’s fine, but  asked her to enlighten me as to what she had found funny. To my  surprise, she returns to a somewhat serious façade. “You know… although  there are a few things that you didn’t mention… did you realize that  you had just described things about Yaya-san?” she suddenly followed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?!”  I was shocked at the revelation, stunned even. In my mind I thought of  the things I’d say about Yaya-chan and Amane-sempai. It didn’t take me  long to realize that though there were differences… a lot of the things  I liked about Amane-sempai, where Yaya-chan’s traits too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt  two hands hold on to my shoulders. I looked up was caught into  Tamao-san gaze “I’ll be frank now, Hikari…” She stared deep into my  eyes, in a way that I couldn’t dare look away. “Do you think you might  like Yaya-san in the same way you like Amane-sama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I just stared  at her, trying to make sense of the question. And making sure I didn’t  hear her wrong. Our gazes were locked, but I didn’t see who it was in  front of me. Instead my mind flashed memories of Amane-sempai and  Yaya-chan. My heart ached… it felt like it was being ripped in two. I  know that I liked Amane-sempai… but… I couldn’t tell myself what it was  I felt for my best friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry… Hikari.” Tamao apologized, her voiced sounded very apologetic and worried about something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  felt something drop onto my hand. “Huh?” I looked down and saw a drop  of liquid, a tear drop to be exact from my hand. Realizing I was crying  my only reaction was to try and wipe the tears away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” I was silent for a while. Tears flowed and the agonizing pain filled my heart. <em>‘Why is it so painful.’</em> I asked myself…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure… I’m not sure what to feel…” was the last thing I could say,  before I broke down and cried. I felt Tamao-san arms move down to pull  me closer and hugged me gently to try and comfort me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t  know how long I cried. I felt so horrible and confused. My thoughts  jumped from Amane-sempai to Yaya-chan and back and forth… to almost no  end. <em>‘Why me?... Why did I?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I could feel someone warmly  hugging me and brushing my hair… And image formed and I recall that  Yaya-chan does this for me. “…Yaya-chan.” Mumbled and gave the one  hugging me a tight hug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry to say this Hikari-chan, but  I’m Tamao.” I heard the person say. Looking up, I realized that it was  actually Tamao-san. It then occurred to me that I had almost forgotten  why I was here… or should I say, I had forgotten it for a moment. I  blushed and immediately let go of Tamao-san, apologizing for my odd  actions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was quiet for a bit. My host decided to use that time  to clear up the tea cups and left over biscuits that we didn’t feel  like finishing anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tamao-san, what should I do?” I asked her in a depressed voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s more on what you want to do.” She told me without looking away from the things she was washing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?” I asked her, not really sure how to make sense of what she meant by that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lets  see… At the moment you have a rather interesting choice to make.” She  looked at me for a second but resumed to washing the used tea cups and  plates. “You can either; forget about the whole thing about Yaya-san  and continue as you have been with Amane-sama… or you can try and find  out if you do have feelings for Yaya-san.” I seriously thought of  deciding to find out if I was actually falling for my best friend soon  after Tamao-chan had said that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But! I have to warn you…  Hikari…” she stopped her cleaning and walked back to me. She sat by my  side and again held my shoulders tightly. I just looked at her as she  said this to me in a serious tone; “If you decide to find out if you  are indeed have feelings for Yaya-san… hearts may break. It could be  Yaya-san’s …Amane-sama’s …and maybe even yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her words felt  heavy. It seems that I have a lot of responsibility… after all two  hearts, not including mine, was riding on this decision. “I’ll…” I was  about to tell her that my decision was to try to find out, but almost  as if she knew it she interrupts me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give it a little time.  Think about it a little, Hikari. Then when you are sure… come and see  me again.” She tells me with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tamao-san…” I felt touched  by her willingness to give me her support. Part of her reminds me of  Yaya-chan. I nodded and thanked her for her help and hospitality. We  stood from the bed and proceeded to the door. “I should get going and  let you write the script now.” I told her with a light smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nods to me, keeping the warm but oddly sad smile on her face. Opening  the door, we are surprised to find out Nagisa-chan was just about to  knock on the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello! Nagisa-chan.” I greeted her with the best smile I could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tamao-san opened the door wider and said; “Welcome back! How long have you been there, Nagisa-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagisa-chan  smiled and raised her hand to scratch her head, in the cute and silly  way that only she could pull off. I noticed the blush on her face, the  very same one she tried to hide from us by turning her head way. “Eheh…  About a minute or two... It said “Do not disturb.” I didn’t want to  bother Tamao-chan.” It made me fear a little that Nagisa-chan was  having the wrong idea about what Tamao-san and I were doing inside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What were the two of you doing?” She asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was about to tell her that I had come to ask Tamao-san for advice. But  Tamao-san had a different story in mind. “I’m sorry Nagisa-chan, that’s  a secret between me and Hikari-chan.” She told her with a smile, before  looking at me and saying. “Isn’t that right Hikari?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” I  suddenly found myself looking at her, and was about to say otherwise  but… I notice her wink the one eye that was probably not in  Nagisa-chan’s line of sight. Feeling I owe her I decided to play along  with her. “Yes! That’s right!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehhhhhhhh…” Nagisa-chan pouted  cutely, a little upset that she was left out of the story. Tamao-san  and I laughed and complemented Nagisa-chan for just being so cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  took my leave then, deciding that I’ll take Tamao-san’s advice and  think about what I should do about my dilemma. I bit them goodbye and  headed off somewhere to think. I considered for a moment to talk to  Amane-sempai about it, we weren’t together… yet at least. We were… I  don’t really know how to classify us. I felt like I needed a second  opinion. Tamao-san’s was helpful and all. I was hoping to get  Nagisa-chan’s opinion but for some reason, Tamao-san didn’t want her to  know. I wasn’t really close to anyone else in our school except for  Tsubomi…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>‘Wait a minute… Tsubomi wasn’t at dinner last night.’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>To be continued…</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Author’s notes:</strong> I made it Hikari’s  turn because, I felt she was lagging behind the other two girls… not to  mention the crowd of fan girls.</span></p>
