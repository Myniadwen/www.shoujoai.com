<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya and  Serané are around the same age, currently fifth years, which is why  Momomi distinguishes them from others in her distrust of sempai-kohai  relationships rant.</span></p>
</span>

Momomi  moaned as the alarm clock went off, dragging her from the warm,  comfortable depths of sleep. When she’d first come here, her sleep had  been restless and disturbed. The trauma of what had brought her to  Astraea, and, yes, that sense of displacement she felt here, surrounded  by unfriendly faces and a long way from home, they’d left unable to  truly rest. She’d never said a thing, because bad dreams were far too  childish. She still wondered whether Kaname had known all along. But  she was finally enjoying her dreams again. It was a good feeling. It  told her she was finally breaking free of those shackles her father had  wrapped round her. Plus she was going to kick his ass at this latest  battle, too. It wasn’t like she was his property or something, and  things were getting better. She could feel it. On that note, she pulled  herself out of bed, rubbing her eyes and standing up. “Kaname, get up  already, you lazy bastard.” That was when she opened her eyes properly  and saw that her friend’s bed was empty. “Huh? Kaname? Are you getting  dressed already?” But there was no sign of the girl in the bathroom,  and her new clothes had been taken. Unlikely as it was, Kaname had got  up long before her and left before she’d woken. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Completely unusual for that bed-hogging, inelegant tomboy. </span></em>Momomi walked into the bathroom and started to wash her face, blinking rapidly to try and ease her bleary eyes. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So what happened to her at this time of the morning?<br />
</span></em>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Kaname scowled as she looked down over the paddock, feeling a dark irritation rise in her again. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  be brooding like this is definitely a weakness. And to come back here,  of all places, to think about my life, that’s definitely masochism. A  cracked girl like me, imperfect and alone, can only come here to  reflect on that perfect girl and realise how pathetic I am. Even at  this. Even at keeping myself distant. I’ve failed at that, because I’m  involved. Amane, though, she’s still far away and alone. I’ll always be  able to look up to her and hate her so fiercely, feel this burning  anger that’s my strength. An eternal, invincible rival, untouched,  unharmed, everything I want to be and nothing I can be. Kariya and  Serané can be and say what they like, but if I have a guiding star, it  has to be Amane. A cold, unforgiving light which brings out my shadows.  She reminds me of what I am. And this is irrevocably her place.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The cold, dewy morning wind played about her face, banishing her  tiredness. Which was good, she’d had a restless night. Half the time,  she felt stupid for doubting Momomi. But the other half was dominated  by those same rising, nagging doubts, that were about herself and  Momomi and who they both were and what they both wanted and everything  else. It had kept her up half the night, and it was still wearying her  now. Kaname leaned on a tree, enjoying the rough, coarse feel of the  bark against her skin. That was something that pierced her haze of  tiredness and confusion. That was something that proved that she was  alive.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But it’s a sensation that reminds me of others, the  ones I can’t forget. Momomi’s first hug, back when I opened my soul to  her and she stepped forwards, not back. Lying together by the lake.  Every casual touch, my shoulders, my arms, anything, her mere presence  comes alive. Does she understand? Can she realise what it means to me,  someone whose personal space is only violated so that I myself may be  violated? Beaten by my parents, in different times and places.  Threatened, injured, mocked by all those who hated me so casually, in  the way that comes so easily to impossible cruelty of children. In a  fight, to be punched kicked, scratched, bit, grabbed, choked, thrown;  all these things are familiar to me. But to Momomi, touch is a  gentleness, a teasing thing, a comforting thing, something that should  heal and reassure. It’s almost frightening, the power of something so  simple, it’s not something I can control. On some level, I want to  respond, to hold her back, hug her close, wrap my arms round her and  call her mine, my child, mine to protect from the world. I can at least  admit to that much. But that’s because I am me, and to me something so  monumental can’t mean anything else. To Momomi, with a sister, a family  that can still be called a family, it’s different. To her, it doesn’t  mean anything much. I can’t know whether it means anything at all, and  whether it’s not just lies, or simply a game she plays because it’s  more interesting to do so than that. I feel the warmth but I can’t see  the meaning. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her personality’s the same, too. She smiles  and giggles and teases and watches me out of the corner of her eye, all  the time. And that runs me through, even when I’ve pulled up all my  defences and taken myself from the world. It’s something more  fundamental and powerful than any mere words she could say, because  words are easily understood, they have a simple meaning. But when she  becomes that, it’s impossible for me to follow, it could mean anything.  I can’t return it, I don’t know the reply, I feel foolish and flattered  and…something else, too. Like I’ve been exposed to the world. It makes  me uncomfortable, just because she’s so comfortable with it. Sometimes  I think she uses that fact to toy with me. It’s a little better when  she’s alone, but even when we’re with others, she’s just the same. Is  that courage or confidence or just shamelessness? But it’s still not  funny to me. Except to say that, is to acknowledge it. That’s my  problem. I can’t even face it. I can’t even face her. And everything  else. The way she talks, the way she smiles, the way the wind plays  with her hair, her whimsy, first one thing then another, one way then  the next, her determination, her confidence, her odd vulnerability.  Sometimes I wonder whether her very meaning of existence is to hurt me,  as if the world would expend so much effort on something so pointless. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smiled at herself. <em>Ridiculous.  However I look at myself, I’m like a lovestruck teenager right now. How  I wish this was so simple and innocent, but they’re not. This is the  opening of wounds carved on my childhood, once again, and I’m bleeding,  inside and out. But that’s not something people ever see. It’s not  something I permit them to see.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Too late she heard the steady  clip-clop of a horse being walked. By the time she’d noticed the sound,  Amane had seen her. Well, she wasn’t going to shrink away or anything  stupid like that. She had every right to be there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Amane said blandly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Kaname imitated, scowling openly at the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you here?” No prelude to that, of course. This was Amane.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whenever  I’m feeling low, I come here. I can remember you and know that there  are people in this world who are even more hopeless than me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  wasn’t anything to say to that, so Amane said nothing. But she tied  Starbright to the fence close to Kaname and started to adjust the  saddle. Kaname suspected this had nothing to do with a desire to  prolong the conversation, and everything to do with Amane’s complete  indifference to everything. Amane was not easily shifted from her  routine. “So, how about you? Why are you always out here so early?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s easier to practise like this,” Amane replied. “There’s no one else to get in my way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have I spoiled that, then? Maybe I should come more often.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine. Like that, you aren’t causing me any difficulties.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Kaname folded her arms, annoyed. “Well, that’s typical of you. You’re as egocentric as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  ignored her, untying Starbright again and preparing to remount. That  was the most annoying thing about Amane. When everyone else fought  back, Amane ignored her. They, at least, validated her existence and  reacted to her words. Amane simply blocked her out as if she was an  irrelevance. It was something Kaname had always hated. “Hey,” she said  sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stopped and turned to her. “Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled for a moment, having taken herself off-guard, then shrugged. “Have you ever been uncertain?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On my first day at school,” Amane said, sounding slightly puzzled. “And my first racing meet. Events like that. Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  that stuff, you idiot,” Kaname said, secretly pleased at the discovery  that Amane was human. “I mean with people. Where you don’t know where  you stand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really,” Amane said. “I can’t say I have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what I should expect, from an introvert like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  if I was even in a situation like that, I’d deal with it directly,”  Amane continued, looking at her rival. “Asking someone is easy enough,  isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only someone as naïve as you could say that with a straight face.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  because it might be hard to do, that is an even more important reason  to do it.” Amane shrugged. “If it’s hard, it’s something that has to be  done. You should understand that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t take me lightly, you know,” Amane said, mounting her horse. “Even if you hate me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t think I’d lavish hatred on you,” Kaname retorted, looking annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re very dishonest.” Amane tapped her spurs against Starbright’s flank, pushing the horse into a trot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname watched her for a few more moments, a frown tugging insistently at her lips. <em>That  enigmatic bitch. And when I think about it, those things I just said  could definitely be described as leading. Well, screw it. I doubt she’s  noticed or cared.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She turned and began to walk back, deep in  thought. That… that was Amane’s infuriating talent. Her words take root  far too easily. But she’d ride out that sense of unease, all her  current doubts, and take everything on head-on. After all, she was  Kaname Kenjou. She wasn’t going to lose to someone like Amane, not even  like this.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Momomi sighed  as she finished her breakfast, placing her knife and fork on the plate.  English, today, but annoyingly tasteless. Well, that was to be expected  of Japanese cooks with Western food, she supposed. She looked round the  canteen one last time.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looking for your girlfriend?” Amiki sniped from the table next to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not,” Momomi replied. “But it’s ridiculous of her, all the same. She should eat a proper breakfast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How very motherly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you’re looking for Kenjou-san, she ate breakfast a lot earlier.” Olesa  took a dainty sip from her glass of orange juice. “Then she went out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You two knew that? Why did you say, already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It may sound cliché,” Amiki said. “But you didn’t ask. It’s not really our business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And, wait, if you were here to see that…” Momomi frowned. “How long have you guys been here anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We like leisurely mornings. And you can hear some very interesting things in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I’m surprised to see this,” Olesa murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That you should be so concerned over Kenjou-san, even if she’s away from you for a few minutes at the start of the day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “Don’t be ridiculous. It’s just a matter of curiosity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then perhaps you shouldn’t lead her on so much,” Olesa said. “You might give her the wrong idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you talking about? You don’t make a lot of sense, sometimes.”  Momomi gritted her teeth, somewhat frustrated with her supposed  subordinate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps.” Olesa stood up. “But you’re free to think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’d better go,” Amiki noted, following her. “We’ll be late for morning lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  cut between them and headed for the door, looking irritated. “That  reminds me why you two are so energetic,” she said, pausing there for a  moment. “I haven’t given you anything to do that. Well, I’ll fix that  soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looking forwards to it.” Amiki waved a sarcastic goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  fumed her way through the corridors, heading for her first lesson,  French. The only thing that she knew for sure was that her mind wasn’t  on reflexive verbs. <em>That Kaname, disappearing all of a sudden, and  without so much as a note. What the hell’s up with that? It’s seriously  irresponsible of her, making me worry like that. And doesn’t she know  that we have important things to plan and discuss? If the Etoiles  really can swing things for me, it’s going to be hectic. What the hell  is a general supposed to do if her second-in-command has flown off  somewhere? Probably mooning over Amane… what’s so special about her,  anyway? It makes me so mad. She’s so fixated to the point of  infatuation. Only not even Kaname could be that stupid. I’m sure of it. </em>Momomi frowned. <em>But she’s been weird lately. Well, last night.  I’m almost sure Olesa said something, but I didn’t think Kaname would  be that easy to lead. Perhaps I was too trusting. Or I did something  instead. She could be avoiding me. That’d just be too childish even for  her, right? I at least reserve the right to argue with her resentments.  Or… I’m completely overreacting. But she really shouldn’t make me worry  like this. I’m totally going to chew her out when I see her next.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  slid into the French classroom with seconds to spare, collapsing into  her habitual seat by the window. She pulled her books out of her bag  with the rest of the class, giving half an ear to the instructions and  following by reflex rather than actual attention. But it was  infuriatingly hard to focus. Kaname being odd, Olesa’s connection with  her, Amiki with Olesa, Shion’s still-ambiguous agenda, the  oh-so-convenient support of the Etoiles, all these things were  important dimensions in her new, greatly changed life. And, of course,  everything still hinged on her father, and his ultimatum, which still  lingered in the back of her mind like a black hole. Everything spun  through her head, confusing her still further, as she went over  everything; speculating, planning and dreaming freely. It was almost  more than she could handle. If there was one thing she hated, it was  the sensation of losing control. That’s why this was necessary, a lot  more necessary than French, anyway. <em>I can speak the language  fluently, so much so I could probably pass for an dialectic native. Why  am I even here? Talk about a waste of time. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Normally she at  least went through the motions of the assignment, but she wasn’t in the  mood today. She continued to brood on everything, doodling idly in the  margin of her exercise book. She was a good artist, and knew as much.  It was another thing they’d been taught. Art was a genteel little hobby  that looked cute in a wife, appropriate for the second child. Her  sister had spent a lot more time on hard business studies. Of course,  the medium somewhat cramped Momomi’s style. But getting her sketchbook  out would be rather too conspicuous. She drew idle little things, a  pretty butterfly, a falling leaf, a small scrub of flowers and a few  bees. She’d always had a certain fascination for that common world.  When she’d been a child, she recalled, she’d always wandered through  their large garden, the closest she could get to freedom. The majority  of it was stately and painstakingly maintained in rigid rows, elegant,  beautiful and choked of all natural light. But her mother had managed  to have a smaller garden arranged, where wildflowers had been planted  and allowed to do as they pleased. She’d always gone there when her  father had been too loud and violent to bear. Sighing and dismissing  the thought, she started to draw a more elegant bunch of red roses.  Remembering something she’d said yesterday, Momomi adjusted the sketch,  adding a vase. <em>That was a good line. The look on her face was too cute. </em>Smiling  at the memory, she tried to draw something different. The half-formed  edges of an aquiline face, smooth but displaced hair, and amidst the  mass, resting next to her right ear, a rose. She tried not to laugh out  loud at her own work, revelling in the ridiculousness of it. <em>Kaname was a flower in her hair? That’s way too priceless. Like that’s ever going to happen.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Enjoying yourself, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked up. “Absolutely, sensei. So you’re doing just fine, carry on.”  Normally she’d just accept it, but what the hell, she was feeling good  today. Of course, she was feeling rather less good by the time the  teacher was finished with her. <em>But that’s just the way it is. I’ve  never been able to fully buy into such simple words. It gives me a  sense of distance, but also a power, that power which was to be outside  a world and controlling it. That’s what makes Kaname and I special. But  it also makes me wonder just how far my world can expand before I’ll  lose that edge.</em><em>I’m sure I’m better off the way, but it’s always  human nature for people to believe that where they stand is the best  place to be. And where I stand is apart. When I look around this  classroom and see all the distant places, I remember that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And the frightening thing is that I’m glad. It’s fine to be alone. Or perhaps… well, I’m thinking too much again. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  drifted through French and History, mostly just thinking. She had to  admit that sedentary musing was something she indulged in far more than  was probably good for her. But that always felt more interesting than  everything happening around her. Besides, this was hardly a time where  she could focus her mind. She should probably try harder. It would be  desperately embarrassing to stay on only to be kicked out the next day  for general low standards. Her rushed essay on Napoleon probably  wouldn’t help any, either, despite Kaname’s insistence on her absolute  understanding of his every move. She was probably longer than theory  and confidence than actual knowledge. Not that Momomi was any better.  Kaname at least could fail with authority. There was something to be  said for that talent, well, more than one thing, really. Notably it  came into play more often than not whenever her friend opened her  mouth. But Momomi liked it. It was thoughts like that she had in mind  when she went to find Kaname in breaktime. That, and musings on how  much grief the girl was going to suffer for making her worry. She’d had  to go to the trouble of looking for her, after all, it was annoying. If  Kaname kept doing inconvenient things…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi,” Kaname said, raising a hand and tapping her on the shoulders. “I’ve been looking for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi jumped, then covered herself with a scowl. “Where the hell did you spring from?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The corridor behind you. Scare you much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” Momomi pouted. “But it’s not polite to sneak up on people. It’s a childish thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I didn’t intend to sneak up on you. It’s not my fault you’re so inattentive and dreamy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  rich, coming from someone like you, who’s only focused when it comes to  violence.” Momomi shrugged. “But what the hell were you doing coming  from there anyway? Geography is this way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I headed  somewhere else first, so I had to take the indirect route,” Kaname  said. “It’s not like I don’t have things to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?” Momomi  faked a thoughtful frown as something clicked. “Well, back that way is  one good way to get to a History classroom. Could it be that Kaname was  looking for me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not,” the blue-haired girl retorted,  flushing slightly in anger or embarrassment. “But aren’t you heading  for Geography, yourself? Isn’t that a little stalkerish of you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be ridiculous,” Momomi blustered. “I just had important things to do in that direction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such as?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… that’s to say… I was going out. I need fresh air after all those damn lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh-huh. The main entrance is somewhere behind you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not taking the main entrance,” Momomi replied, striding on. “It’s always so crowded! This way’s better!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smiled then checked herself. “Say-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, what was your important thing, anyway?” Momomi demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said you had things to do, as well. It’s your turn to explain yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still worried about that?” Kaname shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You got your say,” Momomi said. “Besides, it was only a few seconds ago, so stop dodging the question.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I was… going to ask some last minute questions about the essay,” Kaname  lied. “I don’t have History until later, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Alright for some,” Momomi grumbled. “So you’re going to the library, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’ve got to make adjustments before period four, right? Otherwise asking for advice is meaningless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you memorised my timetable or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I have to help you pack your bags every day, just in case you forget  something,” Momomi said. “You do that way too often. It wasn’t for me,  you’d leave it into the morning, when you’re tired and distracted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can pack my own bag just fine, thank you. But I thought I’d handle the  History in period three. It’s only Art. There’s generally some time to  work surreptitiously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What a lousy attitude you have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  are you any different? You drift off all the time, as far as I can  tell. Your working materials could more properly be called sketch  flickbooks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s only in lessons where it’s pointless for me  to work, like French. Don’t compare me to you, especially as your  artwork still leaves something to be desired, to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes,” Kaname said. “Now, where are we going again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stopped dead. “You’re annoying, did you know that? I’m going outside, I told you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where outside?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anywhere!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname suddenly stopped, laughing out loud. “I must say, I didn’t plan for this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Momomi frowned her. “What are you talking about now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’ve been thinking… about things,” she finished lamely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That reminds me,” Momomi said. “Where the hell were you this morning? Have you any idea how worried I was?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, you were worried about me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s not it.” Momomi managed a straight face. “I’m very busy right  now, you know. I’ve got a lot of things to plan out. I can’t play if  one of my key pieces has gone missing from the chessboard, now can I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No… I guess not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, where were you? Don’t give me any half-truths. I can see through your lies, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was in the forest,” Kaname replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Watching the paddock?” Momomi said sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Watching the paddock.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  godamn infatuated teenager,” Momomi said, even more irritable than  before. “Can’t you manage a week before going off to stare at her and  think strange things? It’s such a pointless waste of time, it really  annoys me. And to get up so early, you’re really hopeless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing like that,” Kaname said. “I just needed some time to think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bet. Feel much like a tragic heroine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t deserve that,” Kaname spat, looking angry. “Sometimes I just need godamn space. Hanging around you, anyone would.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Is that so?” Momomi scowled. “This is why you’re so annoying. You need to be more reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? At least I always know where I’m walking. That’s more than I can say for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah,” Momomi said, pushing open the door and walking out into the  sunlight. “Can’t you come up with something more original to bitch  about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not the one implying flagrantly false assumptions that are worthy of Amiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In this case, they don’t seem so false, that’s all I’m saying,” Momomi said. “You obsess over her, even if you won’t admit it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, what, even if that’s the case? Jealous much?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dream  on,” Momomi said. “You’re my useful enemy. Isn’t that what you’d say?  The only thing I’m annoyed about is that you’re cutting down on my  productive plotting time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s probably true in your case.  But you’re really childish. It’s not like you own me or anything. I’ve  no obligation to spend more time with you than anyone else. Nor do I  have to help you. Understand that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… I know, already,”  Momomi snapped. “But at least with more you’re more productive than  just gazing at Amane. When did that get you anything? Have you ever  actually beaten her at anything important?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not like I  don’t have the time,” Kaname said. “I’m getting back to it the moment  this is over with, and this time, I’ll win.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bash your head into a brick wall some more, why don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  And what you’re doing makes more sense? Amane, at least, is fairly  passive. Your father is a stubborn oaf who won’t give any ground at  all, but you’re still trying to take him on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be too proud of a rival who doesn’t even acknowledge you as an enemy,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better than crawling to your enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You told me to do that, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname fumed silently, wondering why she’d ever lost sleep over this obnoxious little madam.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you shouldn’t care so much about Amane,” Momomi said, consciously lowering her tone of voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In what way?” Kaname asked. “I don’t care for her, that’s for sure. Quite the reverse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With  you, everything’s Amane, Amane, Amane. You’ve got better recently, but  it’s like you’re having a relapse. It really irritates me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so? Well, I’m sure I’ll lose sleep over that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  the one losing sleep because you’re taking on this pointless rivalry,”  Momomi said. “Why do you have to measure everything up to her? Why is  beating her so important? Isn’t number two out of over ninety students  fine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’re number three, I take it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Having a  number implies effort,” Momomi said. “Something you put in and I don’t.  Once I’m here for good, you’ll have a real rival. But Amane doesn’t  count.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not? She’s better at most things than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, thanks for that,” Momomi said, furious. “You measure everything in such simple ways!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me,” Kaname replied. “You’ve never given me any other frame of reference.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still running away. Answer me already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  I can beat Amane, it’s the way I can prove that I’m better than any  aristocrat,” Kaname said. “Ever since she beat my test scores the first  time, it’s been my goal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t being here good enough, already?  Can’t you just do what you like?” Momomi balled her fists. “I don’t  agree with Kariya at all! You don’t have to conquer the world just  because of your past. That kind of attitude is worse discrimination  than the mere matter of term fees.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, don’t feel too sorry  for me,” Kaname retorted sarcastically. “It’s a path I chose for  myself. I wouldn’t ever choose anything else, and for that matter, it  brought me this far. How about you? Don’t you want to be the best?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s fine…” Momomi bowed her head. “But it’s fine to be good enough, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  you, perhaps,” Kaname said. “But I don’t compromise. I’m going to be  the best, the absolute best. That’s the attitude I respect most of all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Funny  that you look up to Amane, then. Because she doesn’t care. I’m sure she  works hard because she’s never found anything else to do with her life,  not out of any drive!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just want to beat her,” Kaname snapped.  “That’s got nothing to do with respect. She’s someone I hold in  contempt for that exact reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Liar.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you know me that well, now, to say that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A lot better than you know me,” Momomi said. She strode ahead without glancing back at Kaname.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  a long moment Kaname considered stopping and walking away. But that  would be too childish. She didn’t intend to show any weakness, so she  ran to catch up instead. “Well, perhaps that’s true,” she said more  quietly. “But you’ve never made it easy for me to know you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s nonsense,” Momomi said. “You just can’t recognise what you see, that’s all. It’s not my fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname was going to reply angrily when Momomi stopped dead. She almost walked into the shorter girl. “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was just reflecting on how lost we were…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  both looked out over the surface of the lake, silent for a moment, then  for a few moments longer. Neither of them wanted to carry on,  especially, so denial was the next best thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What a grey sky,” Kaname said eventually, by way of a peace offering. “It’s definitely going to rain later today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re probably right.” Momomi looked upwards thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, this really hasn’t gone according to plan,” Kaname murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know what you’re talking about, but someone like you shouldn’t  plan.” Momomi prodded her in a half-serious manner. “Leave that kind of  thing to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re probably right.” Kaname sighed. “Do you have any important plans for vital campaign movements?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… none that can be executed with two minutes of break left.” Momomi frowned. “We kinda wasted it somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine.” Kaname closed her eyes for a moment. “Well, I’ll see you at lunchtime. We have important things to talk about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gritted her teeth, remembering what she’d set out to do. As opposed to what she’d ended up doing. “Shall we go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced at her for a moment, surprised. Something like that was  probably the closest her friend ever got to an apology. “Fine,” she  said, turning away from the lake and heading back the other way. “It’s  not like there’s anything to do around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked back together, and despite the tenseness and the silence and  their residue resentments, despite her pride and independence, Kaname  knew that that way was better than going back apart. She didn’t know  why, when all they ever did was row. But somehow, still, she preferred  it like this. Not for the arguments themselves, not exactly, not now.  But because, perhaps, there was something beyond them. If that was  there, if that was possible, she’d definitely seize it. She wouldn’t  have any doubts or fears any more. That was the only way to beat Amane.</span></p>
