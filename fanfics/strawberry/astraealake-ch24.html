<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There's  something about the food scenes. They're just useful, I suppose. A  natural weather gauge of our characters and their relationship.  Speaking of that, Momomi's fallen first for two reasons. In the series,  she always took the initiative romantically, so I thought I'd keep her  one step ahead in the past too. Secondly, Kaname has  suffered-in-silence in the pre-row &quot;is she my friend?&quot; phase. Now  Momomi must mirror her in the &quot;is she my lover?&quot; phase...</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi, you lazy sod! Wake up, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s  eyes fluttered open. She took a few deep breaths, trying to focus and  prevent herself from sliding back into comfortable oblivion. <em>After all, Momomi would only wake me, this time with a slap. Such a cantankerous girl, sometimes…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  as lazy as ever,” Momomi said, standing over her with a hand on her  hip. “I hope you haven’t forgotten what day this is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,  already,” Kaname said, throwing herself up and pushing off the covers.  “I hope you got a good night’s sleep yourself, you’re the one who will  need it most.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course I did.” Momomi turned away, sniffling slightly, as Kaname struggled to her feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She yawned hugely and glanced at the dresser mirror opposite them. “Your eyes look a little red, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scowled and flounced off without looking back, slamming the bathroom door shut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Grumpy  again.” Kaname sighed and walked towards the dresser, noting with  moderate surprise that Momomi hadn’t laid out her clothes for her. <em>Well,  I shouldn’t be too surprised. She’s got plenty enough to worry about as  it is, and it’s up to me to keep her going. Even if she says she’s my  mother or something stupid, I still have to support her just as much. </em>She  opened her drawers and selected clean white underwear, dressing  quickly. She stretched and yawned, feeling the stiffness in her limbs.  They were slightly painful, something she was rapidly getting used to. <em>Kendo  really takes it out of you, I’ll admit that much. Those bamboo sticks  are heavier than you’d think; I can’t imagine what it feels like to  wield a true sword. Well, it’s irrelevant, really. </em>She pulled up her skirt, wishing she could get away with trousers today. But, no, today had to be <em>proper</em>, and that meant the knee-length skirt, the stockings, the shoes, the blazer, the necktie, all of it. <em>I hate that uniform… well, it’s better than the alternative, I suppose. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  walked out of the bathroom as she was shrugging on her blazer, sitting  on the bed wordlessly. She’d probably washed her face again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>At least she practises what she preaches. </em>Kaname turned to her, expecting a chiding, but the girl didn’t say anything. <em>She’s probably fretting herself to death, after all.</em> “Hey, is my necktie okay? I’m still not confident about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at it. “It’s too lose. Draw it in a bit, and shift it slightly to the left, too, you have it off centre.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, trying to adjust the length. “Like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled dryly, standing and shaking her head. “No, totally nothing like that. You’re hopeless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do it, if you’re so smart. Isn’t that what you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess I don’t have any choice.” Momomi stepped forwards, fiddling with  the tie for a few seconds, then sighing with exasperation. “You tied it  wrong, after all. We’ll have to redo it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you before, I’m not used to wearing superfluous clothes like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  undid the tie, pulling it free. “Turn around,” she said crisply. “I’ve  told you before, as well, you’re going to have to get used to it if you  get anywhere in life. It’s one of the major stumbling blocks in life to  people like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname turned around, smiling slightly as  Momomi moved around her and started to tie the cloth round her collar  again, working from her eyes and the mirror with quick, sharp motions.  “It’s a complete mystery to me,” she admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s why I’m  here.” Momomi frowned slightly. “I can teach you about things like  this, so you can get where you deserve to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now, that’s  to impress your parents for you,” Kaname reminded her. “So it’s for  your own good, as well.” It was a bother in a way, but it was also  vaguely enjoyable to go through this simple routine. <em>I suppose I’m  a little gratified at her attention, even if she’s finding fault with  me. I wonder whether she’d do this even if my tie was fine.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that, which is why I’m going all out. You have to look perfect.”  Momomi completed the bow and drew it tight, stepping back and  inspecting her handiwork for a moment. “A little to the left…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She adjusting it, tugging gently, while Kaname faced upwards. <em>I might even let her get away with that. It makes her feel important, after all, and there’s no harm in it. </em>“There’s always something wrong, isn’t there, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you aren’t perfect, that’s the point.” Momomi walked round her, looking  over her shoulder and checking the reflection. “Nor am I, but I try  harder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Waste of effort, if you ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed and stretched, yawning again. “Now what? Can we go now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wrong!”  Momomi said, pushing her towards the bathroom. “You need to brush your  teeth and wash your face and brush your hair and preferably become a  lot more polite and dignified, but I’ll settle for the first three if  nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes. I’m going, already. No need to shove  me.” Kaname faked a deep sigh, tottering into the bathroom and  inspecting her own reflection idly. She didn’t look that bad, as far as  she was concerned, but whatever. She poured some cold water and  splashed her face in a desultory manner, then cleaned her teeth. She  kept half an eye on Momomi’s reflection, trying to work out the exact  moment where she should stop. <em>How about-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Way too short,” the brown-haired girl snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed and returned the brush to her mouth. “Yoo know-” she began,  mumbling around the obstruction, before coughing and waiting until she  was finished. “You know, I never used to bother cleaning my teeth in  the morning, only in the evening. Always worked fine for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a really careless attitude,” Momomi snapped, leaving the bathroom for a  moment to fetch a brush. “Cleaning your teeth is important, especially  after a night’s sleep. It makes them look better, but more important it  keeps them healthier. You’re only going to have two sets in a lifetime,  after all, it’s stupid to suffer later for the lack of a few minutes  every day now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very responsible, aren’t you?” Kaname said,  taking the brush and beginning to comb through her tangles. “Well,  there was a time when I didn’t think I’d live that long… and I’ve never  had a sweet diet, then or now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Though you don’t like sweet  things,” Momomi noted. She winced as Kaname hacked at a particularly  insistent clump of hair. “Stop that already! You’re only going to  damage it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For someone who was supposed to hate balls and  things, you’re very aware of appearances,” Kaname said. But she handed  over the comb without further protest; leaning forwards subtly so it  would be easier for the shorter girl to brush her hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly,  I wish I knew how you manage to get it messy like that,” Momomi sighed,  running the brush under the tap. “I sort it out every day, only to find  that you’ve sprouted a new privet hedge the next day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks like you’re not as good as we’d hoped with these things,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, it’s hardly my fault that your hair is the consistency of bramble.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed, running the brush through Kaname’s hair with smooth, gentle  strokes, and probing for tangles with her other hand. Kaname closed her  eyes. <em>When exactly did this routine start? After my story and after  hers as well… some time, about when we heard that she was going to  leave, was it? I can’t remember now. It feels like an infinite time  before now, way back then, even though it can’t have been more than a  few weeks. I suppose that’s because so much has happened, and things  have changed so much, and we’ve changed so much. It’s been an  interesting time. </em>Momomi gently teased out a particularly stubborn lock, moistening it with the brush and smoothing it flat. <em>I  suppose that’s why a routine like this is so comforting, as well as the  enjoyment of her fussing over me. Even if I pretend to be cool and  aloof- exactly because I pretend to be cold and aloof- I enjoy it when  someone takes an interest in me. Momomi does, and she isn’t ashamed of  that, even if she’d have me believe that she’s ashamed of me from time  to time. I should be glad. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly,” Momomi muttered. “How can someone have natural blue hair, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not the only one, you know. It’s from my mother’s side in my case,  thankfully, I’d had to be branded by my bastard father’s features.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Guess  how I feel every time I look in the mirror. However you look at it, the  European in me has triumphed over the Japanese blood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Well,  considering your weird fetish for this place, it looks like he hasn’t  pierced your soul. I wish I knew why you’re so keen on the place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  the place, as you put it, is a very long way from my father. I’ve said  that before. Plus you guys are interesting. I mean… blue hair?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “Just call me a freak of genetics, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  then there’s Kariya, too, and others as well. Go figure.” Momomi  sighed. “Perhaps some of them do dye it, to look different and because  of their beloved Kariya-sama. It’s hard to tell.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows?” Kaname smirked. “Hey, do you remember the second day after we’d met? You insisted that <em>I</em> used hair dye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  I held you under the shower and scrubbed your hair with a coarse brush  to try and prove my point,” Momomi said. “I know, already. It’s not  like you couldn’t have escaped if you wanted to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I decided the look on your face when you finally realised that it was real was worth the annoyance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  frowned. “That’s such a typical response from you. If I recall  correctly, it looked more like you were too bewildered to respond  properly. Well, I’m done. Here.” She threw her friend a towel and run  the comb under the tap again, before laying it aside.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  dried herself off, rubbing the soft material up and down her hair, then  dropping it and shaking her blue strands out like a dog.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a big animal,” Momomi muttered, coming in with another comb.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. Dogs are smart animals, you know.” <em>That always gets her. It’s as much a tradition as her brushing my hair in the first place…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really. They’re loyal but fairly dumb, really. That somewhat suits you,  though you’re not really very faithful in that sense of the word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, that’s Amiki,” Kaname replied. “Loyal but dumb is totally her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  started to repair the damage done by her friend’s casual gesture,  moving swiftly and confidently. “Oh? And what animal are you, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  a wolf. Strong, cunning and fierce, with a predator’s instinct.” Kaname  smiled, admiring Momomi’s handiwork in the mirror. “”You should know  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s like you, but wolves generally hunt in packs. You definitely don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not. I’m a lone wolf. They’re the worst kind, because they have  no one to count on. So they have to be the strongest, just like me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,  but you’re not alone any more, are you?” Momomi pointed out, putting  down the brush. “You can count on me, if only because it’s entertaining  for me to help you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps. But my strength doesn’t fade away, even if that’s the case. That’s what I’ve come to believe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a sensible attitude. Truthfully, even if we were strong apart, we  couldn’t use that. In Olesa’s words, if that’s the case it doesn’t  matter whether you have ability or not. Without inclination, it’s  useless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? She said that, did she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She did. Criticising me, of course, but she makes a reasonable point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so.” Kaname glanced at the mirror again, watching as Momomi  tidied everything up. Doing that was easier and less obtrusive than  looking right at her. “So, if I’m the lone wolf, what does that make  you? A cat, ostensibly cute and calculating and independent?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Close,  but not quite.” Momomi glanced at the mirror and smirked, making Kaname  turn away. “I’m a panther. The only cat who shares territory with the  wolf and takes them on, one on one, if it comes to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose that’s our relationship, isn’t it?” Kaname mused, looking at  the desk. “The wolf and the panther lying down together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds about right,” Momomi said, fiddling with her own hair. “Well, it makes things interesting, if nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname checked her watch. Just on time for breakfast. <em>Of  course, I’ve had to get used to waking up earlier when Momomi started  “looking after her”, as she puts it. But I guess I don’t resent it,  somehow. I generally go to sleep early enough, as I don’t have much to  do in the evenings. </em>“We’d better go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,” Momomi said.  They stepped back into their room, slipping on their shoes and walking  out of the door. She was silent for a few moments as they moved quickly  towards the canteen, then she spoke again. “Okay, breakfast now, then I  go to the front gate of the school building itself. They’ll be here at  nine, but I should be there early. We talk, then I give them a tour,  and during breaktime we sit down in the canteen and Olesa and Amiki  approach and I introduce them. Then after that we’ll probably go to my  room to show them that, then a private room for a chat, and a meeting  with the Superior in the afternoon. Hopefully one of the Etoiles at  least will back me up there, and then-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname put a hand on her shoulder. “That’s enough, already. Just stay calm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not panicking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  look a little flustered,” Kaname explained. “Besides, you’ll be doing  that crap all day anyway, right? So why talk about it now? It’s only  going to be dull, so we should talk about something interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t know? How annoying Olesa is? How stupid Amiki is? How bigheaded Shion is? Stuff like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “The worst thing is I’m sure you could wax lyrical on all those things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Shall I show you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No need, no need.” Momomi waved her hands rapidly. “I’ll be fine, I can assure you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if you ever want to hear it, don’t hesitate to ask,” Kaname said seriously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She smiled at her friend’s laughter. <em>I  guess she really is nervous. It’s not like her to be get like that, but  I suppose it’s inevitable, her family situation is… tense. By all  accounts, it’s worse with Olesa around. And on top of that there’s so  much riding on these few days. When I think about it, I get ill myself.  If she had to leave the moment I was getting the hang of friendship  again…I wouldn’t accept that. But what am I going to do? Follow her to  Italy? I can’t speak the bloody language! And I know- I think- I hope,  at the very least, that she’s worried about the same things too. If we  screw this up, it’s the end for us, even if her father has to drag her  home kicking and screaming. Well, not in person. He can probably pay  people to do that. So I’m nervous too, especially as I’ll have to meet  the kind of person I love to hate, but this time I have to make a good  impression. It won’t be easy for someone like me to please Momomi’s  family. I guess when it comes to it I’ll just stay quiet and act loyal  and friendly. Like Amiki, though I hate the comparison. Though her  father sounds like the kind of Victorian bastard who thinks children  should be seen but not heard, so with that attitude I stand a chance. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Out  loud she kept up a stream of babble, about History and generals and  whatever sprang to mind, all to make sure that Momomi relaxed. Soon  enough they were seated at their table and halfway through breakfast.  “But yeah, what’s that line… <em>I gave them their orders and they wanted to stay and discuss them? </em>For  once I know where Welly-kun is coming from. Government would be a lot  simpler if it was run along military lines. The Prime Minister would be  the general, basically, and his cabinet officers under his command… and  the speaker would be the Sergeant, shouting at all the mere privates  and making sure the leader’s will be done with most efficiency. A lot  more sensible than all that hot air discussion and stuff like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smiled thinly. “Are you sure? I’m sure you’d suffer horribly in an  environment where you couldn’t argue back with barefaced cheek?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’d never be a problem,” Kaname said. “I’d be the general, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “I’ve said it before, you as a world leader is far too scary a prospect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  I’ve replied, I’d do a lot better than what we have now. Especially in  a military environment. I’d whip this country into shape in no time at  all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good luck getting elected on your kind of platform.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sure my charisma and force of personality will shine through. But who  said anything about being elected? A military coup’s more my style.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. With you around planning this, perhaps sticking around wouldn’t be such a good idea…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. You could be my propaganda officer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A tempting offer, I’ll admit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  that’s another thing about the military,” Kaname said. “It’s a  relatively pure meritocracy, as far as I can tell. Nowadays,  individuals of excellence can generally climb the ranks with sufficient  effort. That suits my style.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the violence, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the violence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname leaned forwards, looking concerned. “You’re picking at your food, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine.” Momomi forced a smile. “I’m not hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should eat. You have to look after yourself, don’t you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay, I tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.  Momomi is quite the hypocrite. As her friend, I can’t let this slide.”  Kaname raised her chopsticks and picked through her own food. “Well,  fish won’t do, so I guess I have no choice. I’ll have to sacrifice some  of my precious egg, you’d better be grateful.” She held it up to  Momomi’s lips. “Say <em>ahh</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eat,” Kaname instructed crisply. “I’ll poke it down your throat if I have to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But… you don’t have to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eat. My arm’s starting to ache.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi leaned forwards and swallowed the egg, blushing furiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  raised her eyebrows as she returned to her plate to find another piece.  “What’s this? Momomi embarrassed? I should take a picture.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just… you know… with everyone watching.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never  stopped you before,” Kaname said, picking up the next morsel. “You  know, being your friend is great. I finally get a chance to tease you,  as well as vice versa. So be a good girl and say <em>ahh</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine! I’ll eat my own breakfast, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,  that’s a lot of fluster from the person who invented this game,” Kaname  said. “Now stop fussing and accept my gift. Don’t get used to this,  because today’s a special day. Enjoy it while you can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  just nodded mutely. After the second bite, she busied herself with her  own food, presumably to ward off the threat of my baby feeding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname felt a certain smug sensation rise in her stomach. <em>Just as planned.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname…” Momomi said eventually, interrupting her friend in mid-flow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want you to go with me. To meet my parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “I got it. If they don’t show proper respect for you, I’ll kick their asses, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only if you want to get rid of me, you mean girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m a passionate individual, not a human computer like Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then feel the emotion that’s called fear,” Momomi said. “If you mess this up for me, I’ll make you die a thousand deaths.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If your father doesn’t see sense, I’ll make him die eight million. So don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After that, how can I help but worry?” Momomi shook her head and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, I’m perfectly restrained. If I want to, I can just hurt people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You need to be restrained like a feral dog or a manic, as you seem to be both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  an endangered species like you, Homo Aristocratus, belongs in a zoo  with a mate. That way you can hope for new specimens.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what happens to us already. Look at Serané for the mate thing, and as  for the cage… that’s far more true than you think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hope you don’t intend to take a life like that lying down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not,” Momomi said, standing with her face set. “That’s why I’m  going now. Some of us intend to escape from our cages.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  help you with that, if only because I hate zoos. A rabbit bit me at a  petting zoo when I was a child and I haven’t forgiven them since.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Was the rabbit called Serané, I wonder?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps. What does that make Kariya? The world’s bitchiest, most hormonal hare?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Smiling like this, laughing like this, that’s how things should be. </em>Kaname’s muscles tensed in her face despite her smile. <em>I’ll do anything that proves necessary to defend it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked to the gate in relative silence. It was getting harder for  Kaname to come up with her usual stream of banal chatter, mostly  because her own nerves were being stretched taut in painful  anticipation. But standing outside was even worse. The other students  walked past, chatting about nothing in particular and heading for their  lessons, and Kaname felt an odd mixture of jealously and irrational  hate. <em>To be able to afford such casual attitudes and soft certainty, it’s way too annoying. They don’t know how lucky they are. </em>But she didn’t say anything, and neither did Momomi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Kaname said, without looking round. <em>My mood’s degrading fast and the red-haired wonder won’t help any. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning, Etoile-sama.” Momomi’s tone was forced, but she managed a smile. “No Serané-sama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s sleeping in today,” Kariya said, as if this was self-explanatory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, don’t worry. You have plenty of your own problems, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks for reminding me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s best to bear your own burdens in mind. No one else will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case,” Kaname interrupted, “you’ll be meeting your girl’s fiancé within a few minutes. How does that feel?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  girl is Serané-sama to you,” Kariya replied. “And they’re not engaged  yet, it’s just heavily suggested. I’m not worried, though, because I  trust her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, isn’t that sweet?” Kaname muttered rhetorically. “What’s the plan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  my instinct is to go in all guns blazing, and rip this guy new  ventilation through his stomach lining,” Kariya said. “But Serané was  against that, so it’s been relegated to the last resort strategy. I  wouldn’t hesitate, though. I’m not going to let my Shizuru be taken  from me by some prissy aristocrat she doesn’t even know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s an admirable resolve,” Momomi whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m the same,” Kaname said, missing the way her friend’s head shot up  at her words. “I won’t lose my friend to a bastard toff. It’s the first  time in a long while that I’ve had one, after all. A friend, that is.  Not a bastard toff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled weakly, earning a funny look  from Kariya. “And what would you do, Etoile-sama? If she somehow fell  for this man.” She raised her hands to still any protests. “Just a  hypothetical situation. Would you stand back and let her be happy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  an idiot martyr would do that,” Kariya snapped, folding her arms and  raising her chin. “I’d take her back, or break myself trying. Love is  something we fight for, Kiyashiki, with every resource available to us.  Serané taught me phrase, <em>all’s fair in love and war</em>. I agree with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sniggered at the rhetoric. “Only where we have the Geneva Convention to  regulate war, there’s no international treaty on love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s an… interesting attitude,” Momomi said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  snorted. “Learn this well, people make their own happy endings. If you  want one, you’ll have to fight. That’s the way life is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gave her an uncertain glance, only to snap her head round as Kaname whispered “they’re here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya’s eyes narrowed. “So that’s the brat? What a runt. I could take him without my sword.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re not all martial arts freaks,” Momomi said absently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  narrowed her eyes, taking in the scene before her. There was Momomi’s  sister walking on one side, unmistakable kin, with the same brown hair  and the same brown eyes, glittering but with a surprising depth and  intensity to them. She was dressed surprisingly casually, with a jacket  thrown over a shirt, but where Kaname would have worn trousers she’d  opted for a knee-high skirt. On the other side was Momomi’s mother-  presumably. There wasn’t much resemblance, except perhaps the slightly  soft, childlike face. She was dressed in a kimono, as if she wasn’t  unmistakably Japanese to begin with. A little behind the family was the  brat Kariya referred to, about sixteen but fairly unremarkable except  for, Kaname supposed, a handsome face. And in the front and centre,  striding confidently ahead, was the father. Kaname’s face broke into an  instinctive scowl at the sight. He had a boyish face and boyish,  curling brown hair, neither of which sat well with the light in his  eyes. <em>They aren’t soft and gentle, like Momomi’s. I’m more used to  seeing that hard, narrow gaze in the eyes of someone packing heat and  coming for protection money. </em>She chuckled at the thought. <em>Perhaps that’s nearer to the mark than I’d like. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, God…” Momomi whispered involuntarily. Something in Kaname’s chest snarled at the sound.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, somehow, they were face to face, and Momomi was bowing deeply.  “Welcome to Astraea, mother, father, sister, cousin. It’s been a  while.” She spoke in Japanese, to Kaname’s relief.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  wonderful to see you, dear,” her mother said, moving forwards and  hugging her tightly. Momomi was slow to return the embrace, which  lasted a few moments before she stepped back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her sister followed, hugging her briefly and stepping back. “You’ve grown up fast without me. Not quite as short now, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo just waved. “Long time no see, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite,” her father said absently. “Shall we get onto the introductions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  gritted her teeth as Momomi forced a smile. She’d been doing that far  too much, today. “Of course. This is my friend, Kaname Kenjou. We’re  roommates, and she’s done a lot to help me out. Kaname, the Phareli  family. Luigia Phareli, my sister, Yukaho Phareli, my mother, my cousin  Araldo, and of course my father, Rodrigo Phareli, Master of the Family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pleased to meet you.” Kaname bowed briefly. “I owe you a very important thing, Rodrigo Phareli-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Phareli nodded politely, then Rodrigo turned to the Etoile. “And you would be?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  bowed with almost theatrical depth. “Kariya Nakano, the first of this  school’s two Etoiles. I’m pleased to make your acquaintance. If you  ever need anything, please come to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nakano? I don’t seem to recall that family…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yukaho blanched.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Perhaps at his atrocious pronunciation </em>Kaname reflected.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really?” Kariya asked innocently. “Well, my father is an important  businessman operating in the Aichi region. Principally Kariya, of  course, hence my name. He has stakes in a wide variety of economic  interests in that city, supported by around one thousand well-trained  associates.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Rodrigo said with barely concealed disinterest. “And where is the other Etoile, Deralna? Is she here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gritted her teeth. <em>That terrible accent is starting to grate on me. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  most sorry.” Kariya bowed again. “She was delayed by unavoidable  circumstances. She told me to assure you that she would be down as soon  as possible to greet you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Rodrigo said shortly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I must say, it’s good to see Astraea again after all these years,”  Yukaho said, clapping her hands lightly. “It hasn’t changed as much as  I would have thought. So you’re one of the Etoiles? It’s a privileged  position, with a great tradition.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Kariya said, smiling politely. “I’ve always been honoured by it. But it’s a lot of work too, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  of course. I used to help out with the Etoiles in my time. They worked  so terribly hard, just like you said. Sometimes I wondered who were the  showpieces, the Etoiles or the Superior.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We often wonder the  same thing, though that may be a little uncharitable of us,” Kariya  remarked. “But I take it you were the one who recommended Momomi-chan  go to this school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, that’s right. It’s a wonderful place,  and I thought she’d benefit from the atmosphere of this place. Do you  know her well, then?” Yukaho sounded delighted at the thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat. We’ve interacted with her frequently enough, and she’s always been interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In a good way, I hope?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. Sometimes we’ve had to provide help, but that’s part of our  duty. You have an intelligent and determined daughter, Phareli-san,  allow me to congratulate you on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re too kind…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname wondered whether she was going to cry. <em>There’s something about this family that makes it cynical…must be Momomi’s pained expression.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname winced and wondered what price Kariya would demand later. <em>Possibly blood. She has to dye that hair somehow, after all…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  turned with the rest of the small group to face the sound, and saw a  very sight. Serané running. But it was… different. Graceless. <em>She’s  running without holding her skirt, and almost tripping over herself. It  doesn’t help that her hair’s a mess, either. Not usual from the girl  who has enough grace to walk on water.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She managed to draw  even with them, leaning down and resting her hands on her knees and  breathing heavily. “I’m so very sorry that I’m late,” she said, looking  up and smiling vapidly. “I slept in late, I’m afraid, and tripped over  myself falling out of bed. It took a while for me to sort myself out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Rodrigo replied in his curt way. “And you are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané  Deralna,” the girl said. “Pleased to meet you. Now, which one of you is  Araldo-kun?” She made a show of looking around the group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stepped in, repeating her introductions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Araldo said, stepping forwards expectantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  raised her hand until he’d begun to dip his head, then grasped his hand  instead, shaking it enthusiastically. “So you’re Araldo-kun!” she  beamed. “I’ve heard so much of you from mama!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Araldo said, looking puzzled. “I’ve heard a lot about you as well. You match and exceed my expectations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re too kind!” Serané exclaimed, hugging him tightly. He looked over her shoulder with a dazed expression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané,  I think you’re being a little overbearing…” Kariya somehow kept a  straight face through the role reversal inherent in her words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, am I?” Serané stepped back instantly. “I’m so sorry! I just get a little carried away, that’s all!” She bowed again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s fine,” Araldo said. “I mean, there’s nothing to apologise for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? That’s good!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case,” Yukaho said, casting a glance at her rapidly darkening  husband. “Momomi-chan can show us around the school, and perhaps you  can do the same with Araldo-kun, Serané-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a  wonderful idea!” Serané exclaimed, taking Araldo’s arm. “Come on,  Kari-chan, let’s show him around!” She began to drag the boy away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,” Kariya said, casting the family an apologetic look and walking after them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi, relatively unnoticed as the Phareli stared after the Etoiles, sidled up to Kaname. “A penny for your thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I feel sick.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “All I can say is, I now know why she has a lead role in the play…”</span></p>
