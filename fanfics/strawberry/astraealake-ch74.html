<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  clarification, &quot;bad end&quot; was a sarcastic reflection on how Koike and  Amane's relationship has accidentally become an alternative to Momomi  and Kaname's in the story, Astraea Lake without Kaname's confession.  This confirms Koike's role as foil, bitch and Girl It Sucks to Be.</span></p>

“You’re late,” Amiki observed  sourly. “Don’t you go slacking off with only a few days to go,  idiot. If that happens, you just know the flame-haired red-eyed  psychobitch will make us do this for another month.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. I’m here,  already.” Kaname sauntered forwards, glaring at the floor. “You  don’t have to tell me that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if you keep  being late, it will bear repeating,” Amiki complained. “Rumour  has it that she’s in an even worse mood than usual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Kaname  asked, disinterest plain in her voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Didn’t Shion  tell you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I haven’t seen her  today. Not after breakfast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that  so? Well, this was so important she went ran into our room in the  middle of lunch. Such an over-enthusiastic girl.” Amiki shook her  head irritably. “In any case, she said that <em>they</em>said- they being her paparazzi first years or  whatever- that some fifth years had been making money selling  Serané’s stuff to younger students. Oh, Kariya’s things  too, but if you violate… what is it she says… Shizuru, then she  really goes on the warpath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I expect  the executions to be arbitrary and brutal.” Kaname sighed. “Are  we working or what? After you make all that fuss, you just stand  there and make random conversation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You, of all people,  should know the danger represented by Kariya-sama’s anger. And I’ll  have you know that you’re someone who will all too easily fall pray  to that. The term ‘usual suspect’ comes to mind.” Amiki folded  her arms impatiently. “In any case, you may have noticed we’re a  woman down. What have you done with your girlfriend? Didn’t you  come together, all over each other?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, whatever. Don’t  blame me. We’re not doing anything until she deigns to arrive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forget it,” Kaname  said, walking towards the cupboard. “We can start without, can’t  me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a matter of  principle. Well, fine, if you want to spare her that much.” Amiki  ignored the sarcastic grunt she received for that comment, walking  forwards. “You wait here for now, Olesa. I’ll start with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” Olesa  frowned. “Is there anything wrong, Kenjou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. What  are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re being even  more negative than normal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. As if that’s a  big deal…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so,”  Olesa replied primly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. She’s here.”  Amiki shouldered a mop and glared. “You’re late! Later than  Kaname, even! That’s the dictionary definition of unacceptable  standards, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good afternoon.”  Momomi kept her voice low, looking at the floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname also  busied her eyes elsewhere, ignoring the sinking feeling in her  stomach. <em>Lead marbles placed in treacle  probably feel like this, if they feel at all. But I can worry about  it later.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you have  anything to say in your defence? You’re pretty shameless.” Amiki  sighed when she got no reply, picking up another mop and throwing it  at the girl. “Here. We don’t have the time to stand around  talking, you know. Now you’re here we can begin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi caught it with  something that could even pass for deftness. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki took a third mop  and walked towards Olesa, handing it to the girl. “Especially if  the Etoiles turn up. Did you hear about that? Kariya’s pissed off  as all hell itself because-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I heard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. Shion find you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. They were talking  about it in class.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Amiki  frowned, apparently nonplussed. “But really, you have to wonder at  the sanity of these people. I consider myself a ruthless and  rebellious sort, but I’d walk on hot coals before you persuaded me  to bother Serané.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some rebel,” Kaname  muttered. “That’s like a resistance fighter who won’t target  enemy soldiers, thank you, they might fight back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So like a terrorist?”  Amiki snorted. “You’re as correct as ever, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, you said it. Not  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so, your choice  of metaphors remains graphic.” Amiki sighed, frowning in  bemusement. “I guess I should be glad that wasn’t sexual or  blasphemous, this is about as high as your standard gets.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname opened her mouth  to retort, possibly to say that any wit was better than less than  none, then shrugged and snorted. Too much effort. “Whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa looked between  them. “Are you two alright? You appear to be in low spirits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re fine,”  Kaname grunted. “And you’re a thousand years too early to offer  us comfort, you know. You’re you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So there is comfort  to be offered… as ever, you’re being difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, hey,” Amiki  said. “So you two had a tiff again? What the hell is up with that?  The sexual tension is getting unhealthy, just get on with it already.  But not where I can see you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grabbed a bucket  and spun, walking towards the fountain. “What the hell do you know  about anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  ignored the pressing feeling of two people staring at the back of her  neck and the one person looking elsewhere, flouncing forwards with a  dark look on her face. <em>Damn her. She’s  always so bloody arrogant, isn’t she? It’s just irritating, the  way she thinks she can judge a situation at a glance. And even with  that presumption, it’s not like she does anything good with it. She  just uses as a chance to make wisecracks. Besides, what’s up with  Olesa? She’s the fricking ice queen, what Amane would be if she was  actually, genuinely a girl. Far too good to notice people around her.  Who does she think she’s fooling, being so ostensibly considerate?  She isn’t a polite person, so why bother now? It’s not like she’s  even perceptive, she’s just trapped in her own little world…and  at this point I’m just being mean-spirited and stupid. Blame Koike.  That works. Everything is her fault. Or it would be, except I stuck  around too long and noticed that she is also a person. This is why I  don’t like making friends. It makes things far more complicated, in  a bad way. </em>Kaname sighed, feeling the cold  air brush her face as she stepped outside. <em>And  how about her? Her being Momomi… she’s more melancholy than mad,  I think. At least it appears that way. Things are awkward, though.  I’m damned if I know what to do, and I’ve been thinking about it  for hours. Well, things will turn out alright in the end, probably.  The only difficulty is that we’ve become specialists in spinning  out the phrase ‘in the end’ to its absolute extremes.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, would you look who’s  stroppy?” Amiki observed, walking after her. “You’ve never been  gracious about the truth, have you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just snorted,  beginning to fill up her bucket. The others walked towards them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s up?  Something happen to the infamous quicksilver tongue?” Amiki prodded  her in the back. “Or have you actually recognised that I’m right?  That would be a first, but staying silent’s just immature. Say that  you were wrong out loud like a good girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drop dead,” Kaname  spat, turning and moving to talk away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki caught her by her  blazer’s tails. “Oh?” She smirked unpleasantly. “So you  really have become hopeless. What’s up, Kenjou? Are you so whipped  and petulant whenever you two argue about the proper way to cut  toenails that you’ll just sit and stew in your own angst?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname spun, glaring  dangerously. “What do you know about it? You’re the one who  pretends to know something about a situation that has literally  nothing to do with you. That’s the only hopeless thing here. I  presume you never heard of thinking, but it’s something people like  me do when there’s actually something to think about. Besides,  that’s a lot better than your idea of casual conversation, which  makes insulting me an obsessive-compulsive pastime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki laughed. “Much  better. You’re back to making sweeping generalisations, empty  rhetoric and arbitrary personal attacks to defend yourself in place  of an actual coherent point. It’s good to see that it’s really  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t waste a  proper argument on you in the same way that we don’t give dirty  dogs good steak. Besides, I do need to think. I can keep up with your  level of ‘wit’ without engaging my brain at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the contrary,  you’re the one who talks without thinking, whether it’s to me or  anyone else.” Amiki began to fill a bucket. “That’s why you’re  in this fix in the first place, right? You said something stupid and  ill considered, and now you’re angsting. You’re right insofar as  you can only think in the silence, but I’ve no idea what your mind  does while you talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It ponders why I  bother talking to such an obnoxious, irritating little strumpet who’s  so dependent on her pseudo-girlfriend she doesn’t even merit the  term mistress. That’s such a quandary that it beggars my mind, I  can assure you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And how about  you? At least I have some dignity and a sense of place, as well as a  family tradition.” Amiki stood, holding the first bucket. “But  you manage to be Momomi’s bitch all by yourself, without even  recognising that niggling little fact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, you-” Kaname  dropped her buckets. “You want to say that again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nah. I’ll build on  that.” Amiki lowered her own and folded her arms cockily. “You’re  a lonely girl who’s so cute on her girlfriend it’s unreal, only  you’re too arrogant to recognise your own sincerity. So you always  put pride first and end up making yourself unhappy because of your  supposed dignity, not noticing that only makes you more undignified.  That’s about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough,  Amiki. Apologise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph. That’s just  how it is, whether she wants to hear it or not.” Amiki shrugged,  closing her eyes. “But I’m sure I’m very sorry for the intense  trauma I’ve caused her.” She opened her eyes and smirked at a  gently smiling girl. “If it’s any consolation, Momomi is exactly  the same. That’s why they make a pair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up!” Momomi  said. “Isn’t it better than to sacrifice all your pride and  independence for one person who doesn’t even bother to return the  favour? That’s what you’ve done, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “And a  painful sight it makes, too. If you take that kind of attitude, you  can only be used. You should look up give and take in a dictionary  sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be you  three when you’re playing verbal chess,” Olesa observed  sarcastically. “So that was rather akin to telling a player who’s  just castled that there’s this awesome game involving a board,  black and white pieces with different movement and even this nifty  little move where the king and another can swap places in one turn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love how you say  that in the same breath as a claim that you’re not involved,”  Momomi noted. “I think that’s pretty final in itself, in terms of  what it shows about your sincerity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And, as ever, you  slide neatly past the point made by simple rhetoric,” Amiki  retorted. “You two really are a matched pair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you don’t like  dramatic lines? That would be one, if it wasn’t for the fact that  she completely missed the point in the first place.” Kaname glanced  at her. “But hey, it ain’t my problem. If you want to walk around  in a platonic courtly love that’s three hundred years late and one  hundred percent unnecessary, you just do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As opposed to a  relationship that’s featured your average man’s three divorces in  the first month?” Amiki quipped. “Under those circumstances,  traditionalism is a wonderful thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So’s passion. We  know the meaning of the word, unlike people who prefer video games.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Passion? That’s not  the point, either. We know another word, privacy. You should try it  sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know Shion and  think there’s anything like that in this world?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not exactly,” Amiki  admitted. “That, we can agree on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They looked at each  other, trying very hard not to laugh. Olesa smiled warmly. “That’s  a little better. I thought you two had been kidnapped and replaced by  very dull doubles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line,”  Kaname growled. “The Olesa I knew has been kidnapped and replaced  by a carebear in human disguise. But I don’t care! You’ll never  overcome the overwhelming cynicism of the human spirit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The overwhelming  angst, you mean.” Amiki chuckled. “And if angst could be  converted to electricity, you two could solve the world energy crisis  in one feel swoop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The proof positive  being that anyone who shows a little sanity and decent human concern  is shot down instantly. I’ll go back to enjoying the sight of you  two squirming.” Olesa closed her eyes. “That’s besides the  point, though. I’ve no doubt that you two can process your bodily  excrement and expel it through your mouths all day, but that will  hardly clean the floor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like how you  pretend to be ending the argument maturely while firing off the  verbal equivalent of a 51mm at the guy sent to speak to your dove of  peace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like how you draw  attention to that by firing straight back at me, and undoubtedly  you’ll like me returning the favour one more time.” Olesa  snorted. “But before Kariya-sama comes to kill us, we really should  get to work. That, too, should be something we can all agree on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hear that,”  Kaname agreed. “So what’s the plan, commander? How about you fill  up that bucket of yours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “And  where’s Shion, anyway? Not here today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s off doing  something. Seeing the Lulim girl about costumes, perhaps.” Amiki  frowned. “I’m having a hard time wondering whether that’s a  euphemism for something…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion-senpai is very  busy with the play now,” Olesa clarified. “Though she still had  enough time to spare telling us about the matter with Kariya-sama.  But it’s natural, in any instance, as she never needed to be here  to begin with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so…”  Momomi replied quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But more to the  point, we should arrange the work again,” Amiki said. “This time,  we might actually finish it in a decent time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll do the  Church. You two do the tower.” Olesa began to fill up her bucket,  shoulders set.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But… well…”  Kaname glanced nervously at Momomi, who looked equally unnerved.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it’s  settled. Don’t slack off, you two, I’ll check up on you two  later!” Amiki frowned. “Oh, and don’t start doing weird things  just because you’re alone again, too. This <em>is</em>a Church.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And within a few moments  Kaname was trooping towards the tower, trying to find something to  say. “Well, that’s typical of those two, isn’t it? They’ll  just decide things on their own and say anything they like. I, we  have way too much patience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled slightly.  “You’re right, I guess… it’s still hard to trust their  motives. Well, I guess it’s to be expected. We don’t pander to  their comfort zones either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not!”  Kaname replied, glad of the answer. “But on that note, am I the  only one who finds Amiki weird? In terms of all that, she’s  ridiculously prudent with Olesa, but that doesn’t prevent her from  implying what she likes about us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s natural,  isn’t it? She isn’t a very honest person.” Momomi chuckled  suddenly. “Besides, when you look at it, they’ve been a pair  since childhood, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Psychologically, I’m  sure that makes them siblings. There’s a term for it, I think,  though it escapes my mind… I read about it once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were researching  incest?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trust me,” Momomi  replied seriously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed. “Point  taken. Stupid question. But it’s painfully obvious that isn’t  just a sibling relationship, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true. Well,  I’m not an expert in those two, or psychology. Maybe they’re just  taking the easiest route to legitimising their interchangeably close  relationship.” Momomi smiled and shrugged. “Or perhaps life  doesn’t follow neat rules. Or perhaps they like incest. I don’t  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if they aren’t  actually related, it’s fine, isn’t it?” Kaname shook her head.  “How can you have psychological incest anyway? I’m no expert, but  you do your sister, or you don’t. No middle grounds there, like  death and virginity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s all  about people who together a lot at a certain critical age,” Momomi  replied vaguely. “Supposedly everyone, not just relatives, can gain  the sibling mental status, but if you don’t meet a sibling until  after that critical age…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cease and desist. I  don’t want to know.” Kaname groaned. “Whatever. Who needs to  think in such complicated ways? Amiki wants Olesa like cats want  cracknip, she won’t admit it, but she’ll say we’re both  addicted to everything under the sun. That’s all there is to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so. This kind  of conversation makes me wonder, though. I’m almost certain that  Olesa and Amiki really do dock at that port, which makes four of us…”  Momomi glanced at Kaname, lips curling in amusement. “Or should I  say three and a half?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say five. People like  me are awesome, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Five, then. And we  know for sure that Serané and Kariya make that seven. But for  all this school’s reputation, are there that many more we can  confirm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Koike,” Kaname  replied bluntly. They stepped into the tower, closing the door after  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned away,  nodding. “Oh, yes… she does work. So you know that story, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That story? Oh,  right. Of course.” Kaname shook her head, deciding to be more  careful in future. “However you look at it, she’s one of the  club.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Eight,  then. Is there anyone else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  Amane, obviously-” <em>Wait. Oh, crap. So much  for being more careful…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane?” Momomi  frowned. “Do you really think so? She seems pretty straight to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Straight  like the school maze… but there’s no need to specify unnecessary  detail. </em>“I don’t know. Just a feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? I get the  opposite kind of feeling from her, to be honest. She fears people  confessing to her so much, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true, of  course,” Kaname said hastily. “But how about Shion? She’s  dubious too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. I  wonder. I don’t think we can say either way, with her. She likes  Isae a <em>lot </em>but we  don’t have to take that for anything more than friendship. No,  considering their age at that time, friendship is the most likely  option…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So leave it on eight.  But however I look at it, that’s eight for, two uncertain and none  against.” Kaname frowned. “I swear they put something in the  food.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Etoiles are  exceptions we barely know. You counted yourself twice, so that really  only means us four and Koike. Still, the odds of that aren’t good,  exactly… Koike should be an example of the most likely case… so  is it an environmental factor-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname placed a hand on  her head, smiling. “That’s enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked and  smiled sheepishly. “Overanalysing again, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. We know who we  are. That’s all that matters, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flushed and  Kaname noticed their proximity. Instead of taking her hand away,  though, she slid it downwards, touching Momomi’s cheek. “How did  things go with Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Terribly,” Momomi  admitted quietly. “I was too reckless, and she was too stubborn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. I see. That’s  too bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Momomi  looked down, frowning sadly. “Say, Kaname, I’m-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up.” Kaname lifted her face up and kissed her briefly. “Don’t  say anything annoying like <em>I’m sorry </em>or  whatever,” she said afterwards, eyes serious. “If you say it,  I’ll have to say it, and that’d be inconvenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “You’re  still looking after your own pride. But we made a lot out of nothing  again, didn’t we? Sadly, that kind of alchemy is only possible with  arguments, as opposed to, say, gold…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who cares about  that?” Kaname asked, looking away. “It won’t wash the floor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Neither will you.  You’re feeling lazy. But if it’s all settled, perhaps you’ll  tell me something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it?” Kaname  asked cautiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where were you in the  last part of lunchtime, Ka-na-me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me? Oh, nowhere in  particular…” Kaname managed. “Why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When I went back from  Amane, you weren’t in our room.” Momomi pouted. “You made me  fret the afternoon away, you know, because you didn’t even bother  to leave a note. And then you think acting cool and forwards for once  will avoid the greater indignity of an apology! After my suffering,  you should apologise by serving me for a thousand years!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A thousand years? How  long are you planning on living?” Kaname frowned in a faux  seriousness. “The Phareli aren’t a bunch of vampires, right? It  would explain your father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think so,  no. I intend to become a cyborg, that’s all. Or perhaps have clones  with mind transfer arranged. What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you need to  stop reading Olesa’s novels,” Kaname deadpanned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you need to stop  poaching her style,” Momomi said, leaning forwards and kissing her  again. They held each other now, in a sort of relief and  reconfirmation. “But remember, you aren’t forgiven just with  this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You either. Do you  think I had a worry-free time of it? You drove me mad!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So we’re indebted  to each other,” Momomi noted. “I guess we’ll have to pay off  those debts by staying together, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that,  I think these debts are the kind that mount and grow forever,”  Kaname murmured. “The compound interest of romance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s love by  the numbers.” Momomi hugged her again, giggling. “Sorry, I’m  feeling silly…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. So what’s  new?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What a cruel girl.”  Momomi looked up. “Well, you kissing me is novel if not new. You  should do that more often.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked down, disarmed by her casual enthusiasm. <em>It’s  hard to believe that emotion is for me…</em>“I’ll  bear that in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi leaned in  slightly, looking smug, then jumped away. “Shall we begin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.” Kaname  picked up her mop and wetted it in the bucket, starting on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I’m…”  Momomi sighed. “I don’t know.” She turned away, starting to  work herself. “But every time Amane rebuffs me, I have such a  frustrated feeling. And that’s happened too much, I know I’ve  been persistent and too stupid for words, it’s annoyed her and the  worst thing is it’s also upset you, because I sacrificed you for  this… but.” She took a breath. “I don’t know exactly what I’m  saying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still want to be  Amane’s friend. That’s natural.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s frustrating,  like I said. I still want to be someone who she can entrust her  secrets too, and I know I’m not that to her. I can’t see what  else I can do, so it’s annoying.” Momomi frowned. “And however  I look at it, she’s such a painfully lonely girl. She’s  surrounded by people but her mind doesn’t touch on them at all,  none of them reach her… how would you put it… even surrounded by  people, she’s alone. And I really can understand that melancholy  feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. As you said,  I was the same. So were you.” Kaname chuckled. “But it’s a  little odd, isn’t it? You’re not a nice person, are you? Your  friendship was initially for very utilitarian reasons, to say the  least. So why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. Now  that I actually have friends, to know what the words mean, I can  understand why people try to be kind, but she doesn’t want me to be  kind. I… honestly, I don’t understand it.” Momomi glanced at  her with vulnerable eyes. “Why would someone so lonely not respond?  Even you did that, under worse circumstances between us and with more  pride. I still can’t shake the feeling that I must be doing  something wrong…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re doing  nothing wrong,” Kaname replied firmly. “That’s not the problem.  This is just the way Amane is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think so? It’s  hard to think that anyone could enjoy a life like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could manage like  that. I wouldn’t like it, but I could manage.” Kaname closed her  eyes and turned away. “You’re the same, aren’t you? Perhaps she  prefers that kind of life. You may scare her, precisely because you  represent an alternative. If she can pretend there’s no other  options but being so alone, isn’t that easier on her? That’s what  I’d try to do in her place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so. But  still.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kindness…” Kaname  sighed. “You’ve become a very kind person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “Don’t  sound too disappointed by that. But the truth is, this isn’t  exactly kindness. That’s something else that is worrying me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname raised her  eyebrows. “Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not just  frustrating for her sake, but for my own. My pride. Like I said, I  have this sense that it’s something I’m doing wrong, and that’s  unbearable. There’s also the simple fact that they call her the ice  prince. That untouchable, otherworldly aura, that completely aloof  attitude… don’t you want to banish that, too? It’s a compulsive  fascination of mine, I think. Does that upset you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I understand  what you mean. I feel it as well, but differently from you. I just  want to smash that image into a thousand glittering pieces.” Kaname  stopped and looked back at her girlfriend, her free hand balling into  a fist. “Or else let it remain perfect, forever. I don’t know. My  feelings about her are every complicated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d almost  forgotten that,” Momomi admitted, rubbing the back of her head.  “But she represents something, I don’t know. My limit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname raised her  eyebrows. “Your limit?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I can move Amane  from nowhere to the place I want her to be, become a trusted friend  to her and take everything I want from her, it’s proof that I can  do anything with anyone at this school.” Momomi shrugged. “That’s  a simplification. Older students are different, and Amane is actually  more vulnerable than most people, because she has no friends at all.  But it’s her reputation that matters, as a symbol. If I can just  take hold of her, then there’s nothing I can’t do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re sounding  more malicious and calculating than you have in a very long time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know.” Momomi  sighed. “Does that worry you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. In fact, it’s a  little reassuring.” Kaname smirked. “You should be a horrible  person. That way you can always be with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed, making  things even easier. “You’re right, of course. I’ll bear that in  mind. But it’s something I’ve noticed after this lunchtime. I had  to ask… you know… why. Why I was going so far for Amane, even  though she didn’t want it. And why I was even letting that affect  us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And that’s your  limit? Or proof of the lack of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. She’s  frustrating me, in a way. I’m so close, and yet so far. When she  told me about herself, we came so close, but she didn’t cave and  tell me everything. With Koike, it’s the same. And now whatever  this is, it’s come up, and she’s withholding information while  drifting from me. This might be as far as my skill goes.” Momomi  groaned to herself. “Yeah, talking in that way, I’m definitely  one of the damned. But that’s not the point. She still represents  that to me. A war, if not quite lost, not yet won. And it feels that  however hard I fight now, it’s all going to be vain in the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname was quiet for a  few moment, then she began to laugh, slowly at first, and then  faster. She shook her head at Momomi’s puzzled gaze, taking a deep  breath. “Oh, dear. My god. Have you any idea how ironic this is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Momomi asked  suspiciously, grounding her mop. “Hey, you shouldn’t laugh at me!  It doesn’t matter how stupid I was being, it still isn’t nice to  laugh at people!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I’m a nice  person now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the thought  that counts! Even if you’re horrible with everyone else, you should  be nice with me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled. “I  see. But that’s the point. Can’t you see it? The stupidest  thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now, the  stupidest thing is you,” Momomi muttered, pouting. “Come back  when you’ve had a glass of water.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgive me, but this  is too funny. But I’m sorry, Momomi.” She smiled wryly. “I  never needed to worry at all about you and her, I can see that now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you babbling  about? Out with it already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just saying,  your relationship with her is the same as mine with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? So hated rivals  and good friends are the same thing now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In intention. It’s  obvious, isn’t it? Inspired by her prominence, a challenge to be  overcome, something that’s so close to the limits of one’s  ability but just hauntingly beyond reach, something that provokes  that kind of grasping, frustrated fury, someone who would prove how  complete you are, how worthy you are… someone you can never  overcome. That kind of person.” Kaname smirked. “Our aspirations  and our methods are different. But it’s the same feeling. We can  understand it now, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m still different  from you,” Momomi protested. “I am her friend, and she does trust  me quite a lot. I got somewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So did I. The  difference between us isn’t great, it’s just consistent. But  that’s all it needs to be.” Kaname leaned on her mop. “Think  about it. Provided Amane will always beat me… or provided Amane  will never quite trust you with everything… we’re more exposed  the more times we reach further. That’s what happened today, right?  You overstretched yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Momomi  replied uncertainly. “But I’m a friend to her, and I want to  reach her. It’s completely different from your aggressive rivalry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps that’s true  in some ways,” Kaname admitted. “But not in the most important  ones. You said yourself, you never quite get there, do you? Do you  want to feel the same thing as me? Always strung along by her  proximity, always a step too short, never quite there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, already!”  Momomi protested weakly. “You don’t have to phrase everything in  such… competitive terms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shrugged. “You talked this way first. It’s up to you.” She  turned away, taking a quiet breath. <em>What would  you call this, Momomi? Irony? No, not exactly… this is living and  dying by the same sword. I’m using your own methods on you, and you  haven’t noticed, or if you have you haven’t called me on it. The  fact that I can play you so easily just shows how far you've fallen,  I’m not even that good at this game. The truth, though, is that  you’re wide open right now. You’re doubting your feelings, your  motives, your abilities and your personality…Amane makes you doubt  everything. That’s what she does to you. I’m simply playing on  that, and when people are in that frame of mind it’s easy. This is  a ugly art, the one that you taught me. And how do I feel, for using  it on you? </em>She grimaced to herself. <em>The  word is ‘terrible’. You were the one who said, so long ago, that  you’d never manipulate me. I don’t think I ever said the same  thing to you. Even so, that’s just a trick of words to justify a  huge breach of trust. But what, really, am I doing wrong? My words  are all accurate and the opinion I’m giving is legitimate. These  are things you have to think about. It’s also important for me to  think about, to rationalise Momomi’s actions to myself. So why is  this wrong? It’s a matter of thought. Just as Koike said the right  thing with horrible intentions, I just said all that with some kind  of petty malice. Even if the words are the same, the intention is  completely different. I’m playing you, and trying to get you to  agree with me, all to keep you from Amane. It’s a thoroughly  selfish feeling. But, at heart, I don’t care. I’m me, not and  never a good person. So I won’t tell you what I know, but I will  tell you what I want you to hear, exploit your weakness and this  situation and make you mine forever. That’s the kind of person I  am. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi was silent, probably wrapped  in her own thoughts, when Kaname looked at her again. A decent amount  of time had passed. “So, what are you going to do now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,”  Momomi admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not like  carrying on in the same way as before will give you any decent  results…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know, so  that’s enough, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.” Kaname  closed her eyes for a few seconds. “But what do you really want,  Momomi? To be a good friend to Amane for her sake? Or to be a good  friend to Amane for your own?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know.  Probably both. Why does it matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Intentions always  matter.” Kaname shrugged. “But it’s clear to me. If it’s the  former, you’ll have to retreat gracefully and just be a friend to  her. If it’s the latter, though, it’s time to think laterally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Think laterally?”  Momomi frowned. “What are you babbling about now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To take everything  you want and triumph like that, is something important you said to  Olesa long ago,” Kaname remarked. She glanced at her, crimson eyes  serious. “Those words sound very touching. But actually, they’re  chilling if you think about it. If you live to take everything,  you’ll use any method for that end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. But what else  am I supposed to do right now? This isn’t a matter of anything but  trust, the one thing you can’t gain by cheating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled. “Is  it really Momomi who said something that naïve?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine, you can gain  trust by lying, though it caves in eventually.” Momomi folded her  arms. “What do you suggest, though? However much I cheat, nothing  will change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so,”  Kaname replied diplomatically, turning away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have the  right to go on like that and then clam up. Get on with it, already.”  Momomi glared. “So what’s the latest genius plan from commander  Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Looks  like I have her full attention. </em>Kaname turned  and shrugged. “Well, basically, that we play dirty. Talk to Koike,  who knows her well, and Shion, and everyone else who might know  anything useful. Dig up that ambiguous past, perhaps with your  mother. As for the rest, back off while playing your word games.  You’re good at that, I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amazingly, Kaname,  there are some things I can and will do without lying through my  teeth,” Momomi said. “This is one of them. Besides, it’d be  convenient for you like this, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. You’d  maintain this unhealthy fascination with Amane, rather than leaving  her be like the bad wart she is. Or stabbing her to death with a  paperknife. That’d work too.” Kaname chuckled. “I’d back you  up if you wanted my help, though. No, I’ll back you up anyway. It’s  plain that you’re dedicated, so who am I to say no? I’ll  definitely support you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what I’ve  done, right? Ever since we learned your family wanted to take you  from here.” Kaname smiled, looking down at the floor and closing  her eyes briefly. “I have your back, Momomi. Someone like you will  always need it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now don’t get too  cocky,” Momomi said righteously. “You need my support more often  than the other way round. Always rushing in recklessly and getting  caught up in something too big for you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line.  Trying to befriend Amane is like setting out to slay a dragon with a  toothpick. But you’re the one who drags me into way too many things  and clogs up my schedule like this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As opposed to  vegetating in your room? At least I have some drive!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And it’s pretty  frightening.” Kaname flicked a strand of hair from her eyes. “But  we’re a pair, and a good one. If we work together we’ll be able  to do anything. Including that future where we shine brighter than  the Etoiles… I haven’t changed my mind on that. Because if you’re  with me, I won’t lose to anything!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re getting  carried away again,” Momomi remarked, amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’re being  cruel and sarcastic. Let a girl have her moments of enthusiasm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re normally the  cruel and sarcastic, so forgive me if I don’t overflow with  sympathy…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked. “Better  than Amane. She’d just go ‘ah’.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m amazed you even  know that much about her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, I’ve been her  crazy stalker far longer than you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not a stalker!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You just want to know  everything about her life, right. Sorry, my bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The information isn’t  the point. It’s a matter of trust!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean you want her  to trust you, whether she actually trusts you or not. Well, it’s  your problem…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, what happened to  the kind, supportive Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s used up her  quota for the day. No, week. Get back to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  smiled and looked up at the ceiling, listening to Momomi rail at her.<em>I wonder, how much of that was genuine and how  much of that was the game? That’s also what Koike meant. You and I,  and her…we’re all the same. But not in a happy way.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi paused in  mid-flow. “Yeah, what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I love you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flushed. “Yeah.  I love you too, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. That’s why  I said it, you idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted. “So why  say it, idiot? It’s not like I didn’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because, isn’t it  nice to say it?” Kaname smirked. “Just don’t get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line.  You’re getting less lovable by the second, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? That’s too bad.  By the way, we never did catch up in lunchtime, did we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Catch up?” Momomi  queried. “In that sense? This is a Church, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m an atheist.  This is just an old building to me. Good ambience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll take that as  an order…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname kissed her,  wrapping her arms round Momomi’s back, and silenced the guilt  writhing in her chest. She was too happy to be guilty.</span></p>
