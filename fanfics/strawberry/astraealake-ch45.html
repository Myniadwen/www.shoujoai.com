<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>Momomi sat and  looked at the ceiling, probing her own emotions. And she was pretty  sure she was feeling a lot better this morning than she did the morning  before. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Why’s that then? Because I have a plan? Well, it’s more  like someone else gave me a plan, but that way works too. Plans, eh?  There’s something about them, that’s hard to define. </span></em>She blinked in the dark, listening to the sound of Kaname’s gentle breathing as she slept. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  came up with some many plans with her, when we were anticipating my  parents attempting to take me away. Truthfully, we didn’t use any more  than a tenth of them, and I got off as a result of something else  entirely, but they were still important, I think. Plans are… a coping  device. When we were alone and facing a cruel reality, plans were a way  to take back control, I suppose. I was feeling helpless, dominated by  my father, which is the story of my life…but Kaname always had another  plan to discuss with me. And plans make you think that perhaps you’re  not so hopeless after all, perhaps you can regain the initiative, at  the very least you can be proactive, rather than sitting back and  waiting for the inevitable to happen. So even if very few of her plans  actually helped, they helped me on another level entirely. I don’t  doubt that without Kaname I’d have no reason to fight it. More than  that, without her I would have snapped under the pressure and caved in.  I’m sure of it. But it’s not like she did that consciously. That’s  Kaname’s gift. Even if she says she’s socially unskilled, she manages  to do so much right, for me at least. Even if it’s only by accident,  that’s still something precious to me. Oh, she screws up, but so do I,  we’re only human. Now I’ve screwed up and the idea that I can at least  do something, instead of sitting and sulking, is also precious to me.  Just like before, I need that activity to clear my mind, and perhaps  drive these damaging feelings out. I don’t think that was Olesa’s  intentions, but I’ll run with it, all the same. I have to do something,  after all.</span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed and turned her head, regarding the silhouette of Kaname asleep. <em>Even  now, it doesn’t take anything more than the sight of her to feel this  strange twinge in my chest. Emotions are so insistently bothersome.  It’s like…being hungry or something. Okay, so I won’t die if I don’t  gratify them, but all the same, it’s that nagging sensation that won’t  go away. It won’t respond to logic, either. Even if you say it’s  impossible, that there’s no food for miles around, or that you have to  avoid eating, that feeling won’t go away. The body won’t listen to the  mind. Body, physicality, it is a matter of that, in part. But more than  sexually, not really sexually, to be honest. I just want to be able to  hold onto her without her pushing away from me, knowing that she feels  the same way about me. Is that so much? Actually, it might as well be  the world I’m begging her for. It’s not for the lack of goodwill, it’s  just something she can’t physically give. It’s not reasonable for me to  ask her for it. But even if I asked her out loud once, just once, I  still ask her again and again in my thoughts and my dreams and maybe  even my eyes. I can only hope she can’t see that, because I don’t want  her to see that, because it won’t go away. I don’t want her to hate me. </em>Momomi placed a hand against her chest, trying to draw off some of the warmth there. <em>The desire for food? No, perhaps this is more fundamental than that. I feel like I’m suffocating.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Things  were so much easier before. Things were fun, when it was just the two  of us together, without responsibilities and without complexities,  against the world. That was a lot simpler. </em>Momomi closed her eyes  and forced herself to look away. She didn’t want Kaname to catch her  staring, even if it was too early for that. You never knew. <em>It was  so remote at first that it was almost a game, the two of us facing off  against my father from across the world. We argued a lot and we hurt  each other a lot and the one time we almost ruined things outright, but  it was still simple and clean. What we wanted from each other was  exactly what we were willing to give, even if we didn’t know it at that  time. But things became different, and they’re even more different now.  Kaname supported me against my parents, but only as a friend, and yet  somewhere amidst that I began to see her differently from the way I did  before. And now we have friends ourselves, people who know us and care  about us, so we can’t just do what we like any more. More than that,  they can see us, perhaps even more clearly than we see ourselves, they  can cut past all the barriers. No, we let them learn how to do that, by  staying close to them. It’s not a bad thing but it makes uncomfortable  truths impossible to hide, even if I want to hide them from myself. And  most of all, it’s all different. What I want from Kaname isn’t  something she can give me, and things are getting so bad I’m not even  sure whether I can give her what she wants in return. Everything’s so  much harder. If I’m honest, I’m no good at this stuff myself. I just  followed my instincts, and it got me this far. But no further, so I’m  not sure what to do I’m powerless. </em>Momomi sighed at this thought. <em>That’s why I need a plan. It lets me forget that I’m completely lost now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… you awake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Damn. Did she see me? </em>“Yeah,” Momomi replied. “I woke up earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too,” Kaname mumbled, her head still half-buried in the pillow. “Nostalgic, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi remembered the last time they’d talked in the dark. “You’re right, I suppose it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s keeping you up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Don’t you know? </em>“Oh,  I’m just worrying about school,” Momomi began, working out the excuse  in her head. “I need to catch up on my schoolwork, clean the church  every day and start on that script with Olesa.” She laughed quietly.  “The problem with a holiday from responsibility is you have to come  back eventually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know the feeling.” Kaname shifted, still looking away from her. “We need to start studying for the scholarship exams, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, yeah. I’d forgotten about that.” Momomi winced. <em>Oh, great. Study date. I’m going to suffer through this…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you’re doing other stuff, we have to hurry. You do need to work for it. Even I need to work for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When do you suggest, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname moaned. “Don’t ask me hard questions so early in the morning…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You brought it up,” Momomi reminded her, still talking quietly. “The least you can do is think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lunchtime. Probably.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  bit her lip, considering. “Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. But  we’re seriously running out of time in the day for everything, aren’t  we? At this rate I won’t be able to keep up with my schoolwork and I’ll  end up expelled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll just have to work, for once,” Kaname  replied. Her voice still sounded sleepy. “We saved up a lot of energy  from earlier in the year, didn’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think it works like that,” Momomi replied automatically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go  to bed later, maybe.” Kaname yawned. “And I need to pick up kendo  again, from today onwards. Won’t be able to make your script meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine,” Momomi replied, wondering whether it was. “You’re not exactly much help anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah…” Kaname shifted again. “Anyway, lunchtime will do for now. More later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You take this really seriously, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s about the only thing I ever worked for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’ll motivate me,” Momomi said cautiously. <em>Actually,  this is difficult. I don’t have much time to spend deliberately away  from Kaname that she’ll actually notice, for a start. Perhaps I  shouldn’t have committed to so many things…too late now. And I don’t go  back on my word, which is why I’m loath to give it in the first place.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Don’t worry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smiled despite herself. “Wouldn’t dream of it.” She leaned back on her  pillow, feeling more relaxed. “So, do you wanna go to sleep? Or shall  we keep talking?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if I want to sleep, there’s no point now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess so.” Momomi glanced at Kaname again, noting that she still wasn’t  facing her. “Why did you wake up? Is this the day where you go to moon  over Amane again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not that,” Kaname replied. “I’m too lazy to argue. I had a bad dream, that’s all… well, more like bad thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bad thoughts?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A memory. Remembering my mother. I think it’s the thought of those exams, I guess.” Her voice was coming stronger.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Knowing  us, these wouldn’t be happy memories, would they?” Momomi asked  sympathetically. “You can tell me about it, if you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  nothing to tell. It’s not really even a memory, just a child’s  feelings. Nothing important.” Kaname sighed deeply, belying her own  words. “My father wasn’t really interested in me. Actually, my mother  wasn’t any different. To her, I think… I didn’t have the right to do  anything but fail and rot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  intelligence, skill and fitness, they’re hardly things I’m unaware of,”  Kaname stated. “But none of that pleased her. She never went to  meetings or asked about my results. Other parents would ask after me or  congratulate her, a few of them were even jealous, but she hated that.  I’m almost sure that something thrust on her like me wasn’t supposed to  have any merits at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I shouldn’t think it was that. People  don’t think like that. She was probably just severe, because it’s not  like you needed encouragement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what I’d tell everyone  else, but I’m human too.” Kaname yawned to cover another sigh, but  Momomi heard both. “I need someone, somewhere, to care. I need someone  to know I exist. But that was never going to be my mother. That’s what  I realised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded, even though Kaname couldn’t see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I cast about, looking for something, anything, a challenge… and I  settled on this. Sometimes I think I wanted to defy my own destiny, but  sometimes I wonder whether it’s simpler than that. Perhaps, deep down,  the little girl called Kaname just wanted to achieve something so  monumental that my mother would have to care.” Kaname rubbed her head.  “I don’t want to have to think about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing to be  ashamed of. Everyone wants parents who care about them, and people to  care. That’s where you’re different from me.” Momomi closed her eyes.  “I guess mother’s always loved me. Even if it means nothing, even if  it’s useless when faced by father’s domination, at least the  sentiment’s there. To not even have that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least I have a mother, and I’m strong enough to cope.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are. That’s why you’re amazing.” Momomi glanced at her. “How did she react?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To what? Me passing the tests?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you think? She said she was glad to be rid of me for the next six  years. Even then, she shouted at me for going behind her back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s… pretty cruel,” Momomi murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t say that. I don’t want pity from you, because you’re life’s miserable too in that respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have Luigia, Araldo and even Yukaho. It’s way too different.” Momomi  sounded melancholy. “Even though, I don’t pity you. It’s not  understanding, either. But I can empathise with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  there to empathise with? It’s just my own stupid thoughts.” Kaname  adopted her defensive tone. “I don’t really care, anyway. But angst  feels right for an early morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This does upset you. I can  tell that. So don’t bother to deny it.” Momomi stretched. “Father will  never accept that I’m gay… but if she really is that bad, your mother  will never accept you at all. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess not. It’s  nothing so dramatic, though.” Kaname shrugged uneasily. “It’s not  important, though. Just something I think about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi propped herself up on her elbows and looked across the room. “Even thoughts are important, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, it doesn’t really bother me. I’m not even sure why I brought it up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked at her and wondered. “It’s a little nostalgic, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grunted. “What are you muttering about now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  felt her breath catch slightly as she was lost in her memories, and for  a moment all her reservations and bitterness and plans were a long way  away. <em>Just like before, actually. The only thing I could think of  was whether I dared to move. My instincts lean to that, but things are  different now. It’s not like I care, though. </em>She stood up and  walked casually towards Kaname, as slowly as possible, trying not to  appear threatening. Then she sat on the edge of the bed and touched  Kaname’s shoulder. “Is it alright?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You always overreact to everything,” Kaname muttered, still staring at the wall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  take that as a yes.” Momomi placed her hands on her friend’s back.  “You’re always struggling alone, Kaname. That’s all you could ever do.  But it’s not like you’re alone any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that… even if you care… that doesn’t change the world,” Kaname retorted weakly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Do you want me to go back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  It’s fine.” Kaname closed her eyes. “Even if it’s a little  embarrassing. I’m getting up on principle.” She sat up, but Momomi  hugged her around the back before she could move further. “You’re  overreacting again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “You know, I was worried that you didn’t care any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Worried?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Worried.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled weakly. “How could you think of something that stupid?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it was just… you know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  couldn’t stop caring,” Momomi whispered. “Even if I tried. That’s why-”  Her eyes were moist, so she buried her face in her friend’s back,  hoping Kaname wouldn’t notice. “It doesn’t matter. I have to keep  looking after a stupid girl like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  are you sure you’re fine like this?” Momomi’s voice was very small.  “You should know that I’ll never be the one to pull away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just this… it’s fine. It reminds me of the… of everything.” Kaname shook her head. “It doesn’t matter. It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  this is what a sister should feel like,” Momomi carried on hurriedly,  even if her own words were killing her. “When things got really bad,  Luigia would do this much for me. It’s only fair you should know what  it’s like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just nodded and closed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If only either of us were that easy to fool. </em>Momomi closed her eyes and tried to bury her own thoughts and memories of these moments, but that was beyond her. <em>God,  what am I doing? She’s barely wearing anything, just her night-clothes,  and I can practically taste the sweat on her back. I can smell her all  around me. It’s not like she smells like flowers or grass or anything  romantic like that, people generally don’t. But she smells… warm. Sweat  and skin and hair, she’s physical, real and here, and even if I close  my eyes I can still feel her and hear her, I can still feel her scent  running through me. I can’t deny that sensation. This is why now is  totally different than before. Before, I only wanted to take away her  pain. Now, I can only think of mine. So it’s useless for me to chase  after the past like this, but still, I won’t pull away. Even if it’s  just a touch, I’ll enact any deception, I’m sinking that low. Is that  so wrong? Because you’re beautiful, Kaname, you’re beautiful to me, and  the moment I thought I could forget you remind me all over again. But  that doesn’t matter. I’ll still be your friend, and I’ll still relieve  your pain. I’ll do that much for you, you deserve that much from me. I  won’t let these stupid thoughts hold me back, I’m just wasting my own  time. I can’t make the world better by beating myself up. But perhaps  holding you will help you, just a little. When my feelings are like  this, though, who is embracing who? Who’s being helped? Is this for  your sake, or mine? I wish I know. I don’t know anything at all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We should go,” Kaname said eventually. “We need to get ready for school, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”  Momomi disengaged herself and retreated back to her bed, hugging her  knees and facing the wall. She didn’t want Kaname to see her blushing,  but thankfully the blue-haired girl was already heading for the  bathroom. <em>At least she has that much tact.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And can you… help me, brush my hair?” Kaname mumbled, looking over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  even if I try myself, I only get impatient,” Kaname said quickly. “And  you’re a lot better at it. So couldn’t you carry on doing me that  favour?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought you wanted me to stop,” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I never wanted that. I just have communication problems.” Kaname closed the bathroom door. “I’d appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She has become accustomed to you being with her always.</em> Momomi blinked, and tried another tack. “Well… shouldn’t you want me to stop? It’s not usual, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  been thinking about that, and I remembered. It’s not like our  relationship’s normal anyway. Doing my hair… isn’t that another sister  thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose it is,” Momomi replied, uncomfortable with her own excuse coming back at her. “I’m not your sister, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the one that looks after me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You give her the attention of a girlfriend, even though she retains the official status of friend. </em>“Even so… I’m not sure I’d be comfortable with it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You ‘re still making a fuss about the wrong things!” Kaname sighed. “Please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I should say no. I need to say no. We can’t go back to that ambiguous state again, things are hard enough for me as it is. </em>“I can’t-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not? Come on, it’s only brushing my hair!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you so insistent on this?” Momomi asked miserably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I miss it. That’s reason enough, isn’t it?” Kaname sounded calm, if a  little embarrassed. “If I insisted on changing everything just because  of… that, that’d be bloody immature of me. I kinda liked things the way  they were, so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked at the flowers she’d brought Kaname, and felt a little sick. <em>She rejects my feelings, but she’s sure to keep the flowers. And she thinks that’s kindness. Who am I to deny her that? </em>“Well,  if you insist.” She tried to find some life in her voice. “It’s just  like you to fall apart after even a day without my help. I guess I  don’t have a choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure. Don’t get too cocky…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise,” Momomi teased. “Don’t take me for granted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m hopeless, I really am. I’m not sure I can take this.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  followed their normal routine, the one that they’d gradually taken to  after they’d become accustomed to each other, before everything had  changed. Momomi, sure she’d shown quite enough weakness for an entire  week, smiled and joked and played with words, even when she was  brushing Kaname’s hair, her mind paralysed by the coarse but pleasant  texture. It was pleasant, something that made both of them feel a  little less tense. Momomi almost asked Kaname to return the favour.  Almost. Quite apart from the damage that would cause to her, she didn’t  want the additional complications. Things were bad enough as they were,  without adding to them. An through it all she wondered where her new  resolve had gone. As ever, her intentions and pride and dignity were  all so much chafe before the wind that was Kaname. It wasn’t a pleasant  thought. More than that, she knew that was something she had to  overcome.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So when they started to walk towards the canteen she  spoke up, saying something she’d decided back in their room. “You go on  ahead. I’m going to take a walk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blinked. “A walk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m still feeling sleepy. A little cold air will do me some good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so. I’ll come with you. I could do with that myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!”  Momomi blinked. “Sorry, I mean… I need you to get my breakfast for me.  I’ll be back to eat it later, but I need someone to get it. I can count  on you, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned and stuck her hands in her pockets. “Sure. If you like.” She looked slightly hurt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell the others where I’ve gone,” Momomi instructed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just need some time to think, that’s all.” <em>Why  am I apologising? I’m pretty sure I’m not supposed to…but I’ve already  established I can never do what I’m supposed to around Kaname.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  it’s fine. Enjoy your walk.” Kaname sounded a little more satisfied  now, if not actually happy. “Be back before the start of lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. I’m the one who has to tell you about the importance of breakfast, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know all that stuff. I know my biology, after all.” Kaname shrugged. “Just be back on time, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will.” Momomi turned off, nodding over her shoulder. “See you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi walked on, feeling surprisingly forlorn. <em>This is pathetic. You’re missing all of fifteen minutes in her company, if that. Don’t be too mournful. </em>She stepped outside, feeling the breeze toy with her hair and smiling. <em>Popular  but lonely, single without any serious potential partners, in my year,  attractive, intelligent, talented but not exactly arrogant. She even  looks a little like Kaname. In all respects, she’s definitely someone  that anyone could be jealous of, I understand that. On the other hand,  I have two areas of concern. Considering Amane’s disinterest with  everything, why the hell would she have any interest in me? Hell, why  would she even tolerate my existence if she didn’t have to? On top of  that, I’m uncomfortable with the idea of just using her without telling  her. Which is pretty ludicrous, coming from me, and is rendered even  more ludicrous because that’d only be a huge problem if she fell for  me. Which isn’t going to happen. Amane doesn’t fall for anyone, no  matter their quality. There are even malicious rumours flying round the  school that she’s straight. All that, though, is another reason why she  wouldn’t tolerate me, and how stupid am I going to sound if I try to  explain it? And then there’s problem two, the fact that Kaname is going  to kill me, tie weights to my shoes and drop me in the lake when she  finds out. Olesa’s plan is fine as far as it goes but the problem is  that anyone would be jealous of me, not just Kaname, because Amane is  exceptional. And exceptional people are slightly difficult to impress  by your attention, they’re used to it. </em>Momomi shrugged. <em>On the  other hand, I can reliably know where she is at any given time, and I’m  me. I’ll probably think of something when I get there.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned when she saw Amane, sitting in front of the paddock and eating her breakfast. <em>When  Olesa told me that, I was dubious, even though she confirmed it about  six times. It’s very early in the morning to be up, and why is she  eating outside at all? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane noticed her and frowned monetarily, then looked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi winced. <em>She  has a good way of making herself unapproachable. Well, fine. I don’t  compromise my dignity for anyone’s convenience. If she wants to play it  like that, I will. </em>She strode forwards as if she hadn’t noticed  Amane, turned, and leaned against the paddock fence, looking up at the  sky as if it was the most fascinating thing in the world.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  continued to eat her breakfast with every sign of enjoyment. She was  wearing her riding coat over her school uniform, though Momomi wasn’t  sure why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, deciding she shouldn’t be looking at all, and returned her attention to the sky above her. <em>The  sky’s blue, but there’s a lot of cloud out today. We might get some  rain. The sun’s bright but low in the sky, so it’s pretty cold as well.  I wish I’d brought a coat, I wouldn’t like to be caught out here in the  rain without one.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane set her soup aside and began to finish the last of her rice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The clouds are pretty, though, even if they’re a little grey. </em>Momomi stared upwards at them. <em>You’re  supposed to be able to see shapes in them, but I’ve never been any good  at that. Well, that one looks like a load of cotton wool. The problem  is, they all look like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane set her breakfast aside  and stood, brushing herself off and chasing a stray piece of rice from  her shoulder. Then she turned and walked towards the stables.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That one looks like a cat. If you squint. And I mean, really squint. </em>Momomi sighed. <em>Somehow  I don’t think Kaname is going to be jealous of me cloud-gazing. Oh,  well… it was a silly idea anyway. Not really a cat. More of a stoat  type creature? Do I even know what a stoat looks like? I can’t remember.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re… Momomi Phareli, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi jumped, turning to find Amane standing about a foot from her with a neutral expression. “Well… yes. What of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A Phareli would know how to keep horses, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little,” Momomi admitted, strangely unsurprised by the way the conversation was going. <em>Well, this is Amane, after all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough to feed them. Come.” Amane turned and walked away as if was assumed that Momomi would follow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi followed, feeling annoyed. “It’s Kiyashiki, by the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry?” Amane asked, without looking round.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As far as I’m concerned, my surname is Kiyashiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane glanced at her again, as if she was going to say more, then shrugged and turned back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned as they entered the stables, looking round at all the horses there.<em> I don’t particularly like horses, but I can feed them, damnit. Heck, I  can ride and everything else, but I don’t like to. I never understood  the horsephilia of people like Amane. </em>She smirked at the thought. <em>Actually, that would explain why Amane doesn’t date anyone. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just top up their hay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  I know.” Momomi ground her teeth. “I may not like it, but for the  purposes of horses I am a Phareli. It’s a done thing, is it not? My  father does the done things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve always found that attitude vaguely annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  do I, by my reasons are pretty much totally opposite your own.” Momomi  grabbed some hay and started to refill the first’s feed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane was working her way down the line opposite. “Don’t mention this to others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  sighed. “If it’s known I’m letting people help me, everyone will  volunteer. A cloud of overenthusiastic amateurs is troublesome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried not to laugh. “Has that happened before? Was it so bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  annoys the horses. It annoys me, come to that. Accidents can happen as  well.” Amane sighed. “If it’s another competent person, I won’t say no,  though. It beats looking at clouds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those clouds were very pretty.” Momomi folded her arms and pouted. “One of them looked like a cat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. <em>Not  much of a conversationalist, is she? I’ve been here five minutes and I  wonder what all the fuss is about. This is a good chance, though. </em>“So…” She looked around for inspiration. “These can’t all be your horses?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  Three are mine. But the others let me look after the rest as well,  especially the lazy ones.” Amane sighed again. “For them, a horse is a  thing for having, not something they care for. Rather like your father,  and mine, come to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Momomi frowned, pleased by this  small nugget of information. “That does sound… troublesome. Aren’t they  taking advantage of you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t mind. These horses are better off in my hands than theirs, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. Quite charitable, aren’t you?” <em>To horses, anyway.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So… which ones are yours?” Momomi asked. She knew two of the three anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  one is Sol,” Amane replied, patting the neck of a stately brown horse.  “She’s a pureblood Trakehner, good on the field, especially dressage.  Well, that’s to be expected from the breed. I had her purchased from  Germany a year ago, so she’s the newest of the three. I wasn’t supposed  to, but she was a steal at her price and too good to resist. Next to  her is Ganymede, an Andalusian. His specialisation is dressage, as  well. She was a present from my other, a few years ago. In the far  corner is Starbright, my favourite. He’s a Thoroughbred, so he’s better  for racing than the others, but his main unusual quality is his true  white coat. That’s very rare in his breed. He was born at my mother’s  stables six years ago, so I’ve almost grown up with him, and I have to  admit, I spoil him compared to the others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Momomi replied, feeling a little lost.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, I have a lot more at home. There’s no point in keeping the best  racing horses under these conditions, even if my mother would let me  have them. But still, they’re fine animals.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So your mother likes horses, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s her passion. She has plenty of time to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I imagine so.” Momomi frowned. <em>Of  course, then there’s that attitude to arranged marriage. A life of  leisure, if you aren’t interested in this love and independence stuff.  I wonder what Amane thinks, for herself. </em>“It’s flowers, with my mother, and gardening.” She laughed sarcastically. “Well, she has to do something with her time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried not to snort. <em>Yeah, not a good conversationalist, unless you like horses. No wonder she doesn’t notice Kaname. Kaname’s not a horse. </em>She blinked at the thought then checked her watch. “Damn… I gotta go. I haven’t had breakfast yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane didn’t even look round.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you later!” Momomi took off, wondering whether Amane had even noticed. <em>She’s…so…weird.  Totally indifferent to everything, just like I thought, she doesn’t  care whether I come or go and she’s not very interested in what I’m  saying. She didn’t even bother to ask why I came or what I wanted, it  isn’t important to her. In a way, it’s kinda annoying. It’s like I  don’t exist or something. But- </em>Momomi frowned. <em>She asked me to  help her with the horses. Probably for the sake of the horses, but  still, she asked me. I wish I knew why. Heck, I wish I’d asked why.  It’s not like she can’t handle it herself, it makes no sense. She makes  no sense. She’s completely enigmatic. It’s infuriating! </em>Momomi scowled, then recovered herself, thinking it over again. <em>Actually,  it is, but it’s also interesting. She’s a riddle that hasn’t be solved  yet, and I’m the one to do it. This might serve a function, but I may  even enjoy it for myself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Amane, you’re just like Kaname  was before, completely shut off from the world. That’s right, before  that moment when she told me who she was. And like Kaname before you,  I’m going to break you right open. Partly for your sake, partly for  mine. And partly to see what’s hiding in your heart. </em></span></p>
