</span>

“How have things been, Kiyashiki-san?” Olesa asked.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  considered this, looking for the trap. “How do I say this… things have  been a little stressful, I guess. To say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  I don’t think I’m getting anywhere, either. Not like the Etoiles, who  are at least making some progress, or it seems that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even  in their case, it would do to be premature in your judgements. Your  father is not an easy man to dissuade when he has picked a course, as  he is small-minded and unimaginative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You don’t need to tell  me. I’m in no danger of forgetting that.” Momomi sighed. “That’s the  problem. Even when I say, how am I supposed to persuade that idiot to  let me stay here? He’s impossible to move, because he thinks that  listening to other people’s opinions and feelings is a matter of  weakness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The main way of dealing with someone of that kind is  to persuade them that their point of view is a certain thing, which  completely coincidentally is what you want. At that point, all else  follows, all the quicker because they’re stubborn oafs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’s easy for you to say that, but it’s not exactly easy, either. How can I do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  have to persuade him that the connections and people here at Astraea  are important,” Olesa said. “That’s why it’s unfortunate that neither  Kenjou nor myself come from particularly prestigious backgrounds. Well,  I did once, but he saw to that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes, yes. No need to go over that again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tomori-san, on the other hand, could be of some use.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shion? She’s an important person?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not  exactly. She’s the daughter of a fairly known journalist, if I recall.  But like her father before her, she knows important people, and all  about them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed. “Journalist, eh? Why does everyone know this stuff except us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You never bother to ask. If you ever come out of your shell of idleness, I suggest you begin with some basic research.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes, yes. I find it a little creepy, myself. Just like Shion’s stalker tendencies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  can afford those thoughts because you can afford that complacency,”  Olesa said. “But that may not be forever. If you want to be free of  your father- and for the time after you are free- you can’t afford such  inhibitions. Take every weapon you can and use them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  turned away and looked around the Church. “As ever, you’re not the mist  gifted conversationalist. I’m inclined to pessimism, and Kaname’s  worse, but I’ve never met anyone who can outdo you at making the world  appear a dreary and virtueless place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s because I tell  thing show they are, no more, no less,” Olesa replied. “Do you think I  enjoy it? It’s something that must be done for me to live… and for you  as well, if you really mean to leave your cosy existence behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not like I don’t know that. But you don’t have to talk about it all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  just reminding you, which needs to be done. If you intend to support  yourself through scholarships alone, for example, what will you do if  you fail the exam?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know, I know. But can we at least focus on  my father right now? He’s more than enough of the a problem to be  getting on with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa shrugged. “If that’s what you want.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When  you say that, you somehow make it sound like I’m irresponsible for not  listening, rather than the fact, which is you being paranoid and  annoying.” Momomi looked at the other girl. “But I’m glad for your  concern. You’re actually talking to me now, as an equal, which is more  than you did before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I think that cuts both ways, and I still  wouldn’t be surprised if you hold me in contempt. I certainly haven’t  forgiven you.” Olesa shrugged. “I suppose that it’s easier to hate your  father while your father is here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t bear any particular grudge. Unlike you, I’m inclined to let bygones be bygones.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then forgive your father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not  easy?” Olesa suggested. “People talk about forgiveness very easily, but  sometimes it’s more human to bear a grudge. Forgiveness is just a way  of making others feel less guilty, but as far as I’m concerned, the  guilty shouldn’t be able to easily escape their crimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Unfortunately,  my father isn’t guilty at all. That must be frustrating.” Momomi  sighed. “Sometimes I wonder whether you project it all onto me because  of that. But I’m not guilty, either, because I didn’t do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  overanalysing. But certainly your father is infuriating in the extreme.  He has no sense… no sense at all… of the nature of his crimes.” Olesa  gritted her teeth. “That a man like that can live as well and  unburdened as he does is one of the reasons why I know there’s very  little fairness or justice in this world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So why not tell him? Why not make him aware of his crimes, as you put it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do you want me too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi considered this. “Not right now, no. That wouldn’t do me any favours. But afterwards, perhaps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even  if I do, it wouldn’t serve except to gratify my feelings. That would be  enough, but it probably wouldn’t even do that.” Olesa looked up at the  stained glass windows, her chin set. “If he doesn’t know what he’s  done, then I won’t make him guilty even if I do tell him. He’d just  dismiss it with disinterest, and that would be even more painful for  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right, I guess. That’s exactly like him. But even  so. If you feel something so strongly, you should tell him while you  have the chance.” Momomi frowned, picking her words. “I don’t know you  very well, and you don’t like me very much, but I still get this sense  that you’re letting this eat you from the inside out. Even if saying it  provides no closure for you, shouldn’t you go ahead anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do you think that would get me off your back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t care about that. In fact, I’m almost gratified by the attention. This is advice for your own good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  as ever, you make things sound very simple, Kiyashiki-san. But how  about you? Can’t you think of scenarios where expressing your thoughts  wouldn’t help at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kenjou-san  and Ohtori-san, for example. I may be mistaken, but as far as I know  from both sides, your Kaname has told several people about her  resentment, but never Amane. If you want to know why I don’t tell your  father everything, it’s probably for the same reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case,” Momomi said, deciding to slide past the topic. “I’ve been meaning to congratulate you on your restraint.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“My restraint?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  not so feckless that I don’t know what it must cost to be around my  father at all. More than that, you’re more polite to him than I am, for  the most part, if a little constrained. It’s more than I deserve.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  is, but it’s not for you.” Olesa gave her an emotionless glance. “I’ve  grown used to that, masking myself and saying what people expect to  hear, not what’s real. It’s an easier way to deal with them than  presenting my true, inconvenient self.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes, well… that’s another thing. It can’t be healthy, all the same, to hide yourself from everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You shouldn’t chide me just because I’ve learned to realise the kind of behaviour you only pretend to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  not what I mean. With my father, it’s fine. But I’d worry if you didn’t  open up to someone. I suppose there’s always Amiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You shouldn’t speak as if you’re taking her for granted. I don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You don’t? Even after all these years?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa  folded her arms. “Frankly, it defies my expectations that she’s willing  to spend this long working for my life rather than her own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  giggled. “I guess it does, too, though it doesn’t surprise me. You’ve  got it a little backwards, Olesa. She’s working for her own life,  because you are her life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That doesn’t make any sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Never  mind. But even them, it’s a pity… when you actually talk to me, you’re  intelligent and interesting. It’s a bit of a pity that you hide that  from everyone behind your robotic persona.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now you have it  backwards. I’m naturally restrained, and Alicia alone can ease that.  But you’re quite the hypocrite to tell me that. Aren’t you and Kaname  the same?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi ran a hand through her hair. “Well, you’re  right, of course. When I look at it, I’ve kinda wasted my time here.  But that doesn’t mean I don’t want another chance at it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“An epiphany, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“One of several I’ve been having in recent times… don’t talk to me about those.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey,  hey, hey. What are you two muttering about?” Kaname demanded, dropping  the buckets. They’d finally agreed that the two physically strong girls  would do all that work, while the other two would start mopping the  moment the water was there. In the words of Kaname, <em>going twice actually works out faster than watching you two stumble around, so forget it. </em>Even if the phrasing was unflattering, Momomi did appreciate their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We were discussing important things that can’t be talked about in front of lackeys,” Olesa said, her face as deadpan as ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You what?” Kaname exploded. “Who the hell are you calling a lackey?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  not like that,” Momomi said hurriedly. “She’s just playing with you. We  were talking about my father and things, nothing exciting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you it’s hard to get good help these days,” Olesa said to her. “You should try harder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“God, what’s up with that stuck-up attitude?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi rolled her eyes. <em>Is this Olesa’s concept of a joke? Too bad Kaname’s always going to take that kind of bait. </em>“How about you?” she asked Amiki. “Are you fine being addressed like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What’s there to be upset about? I’m not as egotistical and unbalanced as that maniac,” she said, indicating Kaname.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  not anything to do with that. You said it yourself, didn’t you? People  like those who assert themselves, instead of just quietly accepting  everything coming at them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I was referring to romance, you idiot. Though that would be one reason for the blue-haired punk to act up so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey! Don’t talk about me as if I’m not here, or I’ll prove that I’m here the hard way!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I knew exactly what you were referring to when you said that, Amiki,” Momomi said. “That’s precisely why I brought it up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki flushed, out of anger or embarrassment, it was hard to tell. “What are you implying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As much or as little as you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shall we get on,” Olesa asked icily. “That should be enough madness for one evening, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Knowing you guys? That’s enough for five minutes,” Kaname muttered, picking up her mop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re one to talk!” Momomi exclaimed. “Don’t speak as if you’re not part of this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I try my best, you know, but I can’t keep up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  you can say that with all apparent seriousness is just another proof  that you’re the maddest of us all,” Amiki said. “Though it’s generally  you two and your double act anyway. Don’t look at me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa sighed, inspecting the ceiling with apparent fascination.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah, here we are. Time for a reunion session? It’s been a while, you know, why are you all looking grumpy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi turned around. “It’s been a couple of days, Shion, don’t cry yourself to sleep. Ah… why’s Araldo here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  that’s to say… I’m somewhat hiding from uncle right now,” Araldo said,  scratching the back of his head. “He’s expressed an earnest desire to  rip me limb from limb. You know how it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded solemnly. She knew how it was. “So, how the hell did you end up here? And with Shion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  stood grinning, a hand on her hip. “I caught him wandering around and  recognised him, so I gave him some well-meaning advice. It looks like I  didn’t need to bother, though; he’s got a properly respectful attitude  into his head anyway. So I dragged him here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hoping that father will burn up on holy ground?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Something  like that. But I feel pretty out of my depth,” Araldo said. “I’ve been  beaten before I started to a girl I like, who is supposedly intended to  me, by another girl, chewed out by everyone from my uncle to the two  said girls to several more several years younger than me, and given to  understand that I can choose between death by katana and death by  dismemberment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi had to laugh, despite herself. “Welcome to  Astraea Hill. Be glad, you’d never know how ferocious Catholic school  girls could be unless you came here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, what are you doing, cousin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, that’s-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Punishment,” Shion said promptly. “They have to clean this place every day for a month.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Really?” Araldo managed not to laugh. “What did they do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They had a big fight which only stopped when the Etoiles came.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Wow. I thought you were friends, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  we’re friends,” Momomi said shortly. “We just have a special way of  showing our affection for each other. Which is something Shion’s going  to experience after I’m finished here, because I like her <em>oh so much </em>right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">This time, Araldo laughed. “I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, can I clarify something that just occurred to me?” Kaname said abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We were sent here because we got into a big fight due to our differences, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi shrugged. “That’s right, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So,  our punishment for that is to spend an extended duration in close  proximity of each other, in a fairly empty building no less, and with  long polls and water to hand? Doesn’t that sound a little dangerous to  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You have a point. Perhaps Kariya was looking for an excuse  to punish us again. Seems like her style. However you look at it, we  but especially you have been a pain in her ass for months.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that is possible. But I think it’s more likely that she’s just selectively dumb.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, quite... so, what’s the situation with my beloved father?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told him. He didn’t like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  smirked. “I guessed as much… heck, I anticipated that much when you  announced your noble intentions to Serané-sama. But I presumed that you  knew the consequences.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I did. That doesn’t mean I have to like  it.” Araldo sighed. “And of course he didn’t listen and made all sorts  of threats about what he would take away from me if I didn’t pursue  this with all my energy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tush,” Kaname said. “Don’t be so  spineless. This is the twenty-first century, boy, be glad, because he  can’t force you to do anything. This isn’t like the older times when  samurai and knights and stuff trusted their darling mothers and fathers  to arrange their weddings, only to find that they were with girls who  had a startling disinterest in them and kept sneaking off with the  chambermaids. Or… I dunno, mikos? What girls did they have in the  houses of samurai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo gave her a puzzled look, plainly  unused to Kaname being Kaname. “Well, it can’t be a forced marriage, of  course, but it can still be a consensual marriage with some pretty  strong coercion involved. I hope it doesn’t come to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah,  yeah. That’s not important. Now, they did have house servants, didn’t  they? I can’t remember any specific titles, though, from what Momomi’s  told me it sounds like you guys have it all better organised…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  mind her,” Momomi said. “There’s something about the Church, it gets to  her head… do you drink the communion wine, Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course not. No need to be sarcastic if you can’t follow me. I’m wasted on this audience, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Right, well, what are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo shrugged. “I’m going to resist as best I can. He’s a hard man to deal with, but caving in won’t solve anything at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’d  better,” Shion said. “If you don’t take a stand, you’ll only force  Serané-sama to make one herself, and that would be very troublesome for  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know, I know. That reminds me… who is she, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you, already!” Shion snapped. “I’m a friend of Momomi’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t worry if she’s frighteningly well-informed,” Momomi confided. “She’s basically a stalker, so it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Slander, now?” Shion put on a hurt look. “I’m going to stand over here with Kenjou-san and feel unappreciated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, don’t associate me with you, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As graceless as ever…” Shion sighed theatrically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>What  is it about my friends? I’ve somehow got a bunch of people who survive  by scoring points off each other together. I’m one of them, I’m hardly  ashamed about that, but if Kaname and I alone together is bad enough,  then it gets exponentially worse as you add even more people, until  it’s impossible to string a sentence together without someone ripping  it apart. Araldo’s the only normal one and he’ll be gone soon enough.  The whole thing’s pretty annoying. </em>Momomi frowned to herself as she started to mop the floor. <em>But  let’s wait a second, did I just describe this motley bunch as friends?  Now that’s definitely a depressing thought. But we’re just business  partners, right? Shion’s here in return for a favour I’m doing her,  Amiki’s here for Olesa and Olesa’s here because I blackmailed her into  it. I chose them all myself and used them because they’d be useful. I  thought that it would be easy enough to get them to do as much as  possible and then forget about them. </em>She sighed. <em>When I think  about it, though, I’d be a little annoyed if Olesa just buggered off  and went back to her old ways the moment I handed over my phone. It  would be…unfair, somehow, and as stupid as that sounds, because that is  the extent of our understanding. And it’s the same with Shion, as well.  So I suppose I have come to like them, somehow. I don’t know what it is  about them…no, it’s probably nothing to do with their personal  qualities, or rather it’s in spite of their personal qualities. But  they do seem like friends, all the same, even when Olesa’s being cold  and sarcastic or when Shion’s dragging me into something or when  Amiki’s picking a fight with Kaname and touching on subjects I’m  increasingly uncomfortable with. It’s… depressing, how unfamiliar I am  with the concept.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She looked around quietly; noting that no  one appeared to have noticed her silence. Shion was carrying the  conversation, backed up with Araldo’s politeness and Amiki’s lack of  it, as well as Olesa’s occasional cutting comment. <em>If I was going  to have to have a lot of… friends, I guess that’s something I’d have to  get used to. The fact that though they like me, they probably won’t  always need or even want me and they can manage quite fine without me.  It’s that kind of relationship, I guess, friendship. Even if you miss a  friend, you’ll rarely say that. It’s more a matter of the tacit, where  you enjoy each other’s company and the day is less arduous if you’re  together, but you’re never going to say that you have to be together.  Or something, it’s not like I know much about the subject. But it seems  that way to me. It’s nice, I guess, and quite fun, but there’s  something a little disheartening about it as well. I like the sensation  of being irreplaceable, and that’s not something you get from this kind  of friendship. Of course, the kind of relationship where you’re  irreplaceable and unafraid to say that you can’t replace the other  person isn’t… practical, for me. There’s only her, and she’s not  interested. But on the other hand, I do get the sense that she’d have a  hard time without me, and that’s not arrogance. We tried it and neither  of us liked it, and she told me as well, that she wants to be with me,  and it’s the same for me. So, what’s that? More than friendship, less  than a couple? I suppose that’d be a best friend or something like  that. Kaname as my best friend? </em>Momomi chuckled. <em>That has a  surprisingly forlorn sound to it, but that’s just me. I should get used  to it, no, I should be glad for that much. When I look at it, I’m  really glad, and very lucky, that I got to know Kaname. Not just know  of her, not just argue with her, but truly know her. That might not  have happened if it wasn’t for father? Should I think him or something?  Yeah, right…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>A penny for your thoughts</em>… isn’t that the idiom?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  looked up, startled, and saw Kaname looking at her from a few feet  away. “Ah… yeah.” She’d drifted away from the others in her haze, so  there was no escape that way. “I’d like to be paid in yen, though. This  is Japan, after all. One hundred will do nicely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Drop dead and tell me anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  was just thinking about what you’d call a friend.” Momomi sighed,  leaning on her mop and looking out the window. “I don’t know much about  friendship. For most of my childhood, I was kept in the house with my  tutors, and the servants who were all too old, and I got told off if I  talked to them, and I wasn’t allowed to go out much… really, all I had  was sister. I had a pretty lonely childhood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname nodded. “Well, whatever your father was trying to achieve, it doesn’t exactly work, did it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  right. I guess that phase of my life, all the times I snuck out in the  middle of the night, was a kind of reaction against that confinement. I  wonder, is it unnatural to keep people like that? It’s so agonisingly  conventional to portray friendship as a positive force and loners as  some kind of freak…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Personally, speaking as a loner, I wouldn’t  call that part of it unnatural,” Kaname said. “What was unnatural is  that you had no choice. I decided to live this way, for myself, but you  weren’t given any such opportunity. That’s especially unfair because  you, of all people, should have many friends and be very liked. That’s  how it should be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blushed slightly. “You think… I doubt  that. But how about you? It seems like you should be really popular  too, because you’re handsome and funny…” Embarrassed, she tried to  cover herself. “What was your childhood like? Were you a lonely child?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  it’s not like I was lonely,” Kaname said. “But I didn’t have any  friends, either. Those are two different things. No, where you had no  company at all I had the other kind of negative experience… the company  of people who liked to pick on me and each other, and who’d sell each  other out for… I don’t know, one hundred yen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That sounds pretty terrible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  all I learned from that crowd was how to fight and how to blunt your  emotions to the point where there’s no external signs at all. So I  don’t know what you call a friend, either.” Kaname looked somber. “And  truthfully, what I learned from them, still haunts me. I find it really  hard to express emotion, it’s almost impossible for me to talk about my  feelings.” She smiled and glanced sidelong at Momomi. “I guess you know  what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi felt her heartbeat jump. <em>Damnit, it’d only feel more shaken if she’d pulled a gun on me. Don’t say such painfully ambiguous things! </em>“Well,  yes… but that just means I appreciate it when you try. If you know what  I mean. You have to get over yourself, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s the  funny thing, though. I find it a bit easier with you. Well, the fact  that I can admit that is evidence in itself.” Kaname glanced at her  with an amused smile on her lips. “I wish I knew why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Okay,  now it’s worse than the pistol scenario. Perhaps if she confessed that  she was once a man… or if she confessed something else. I can always  dream, can’t I? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But we’re both pretty messed up people,  aren’t we?” Kaname said affectionately. “You know, before I met you,  I’d never have believed anyone who said you could find a head-case as  bad as mine in someone from the upper classes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, thanks,” Momomi pouted. “I appreciate the sentiment. There have to be better ways for our meeting to be commended.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  flicked her forehead and laughed. “Don’t take me too seriously. But  that’s another one, when I think about it… before I met you, I was  never able to talk about these things so lightly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi’s face stiffened slightly as she remembered. “Well, you take yourself too seriously as it is. I just do what I can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  don’t do very much, actually, but it’s a thing about you. Cracked girl,  was it, when I talked about myself? Someone incomplete inside, with no  right to life… that’s what I used to say. I guess the trick you have is  to fool me into feeling complete.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you haven’t noticed that  you’re a real person, and that either everyone or no one has a right to  life, then you’re an idiot,” Momomi said shakily. “But I’m the same.  It’s hard for someone who spends their life acting to feel real, but  you managed to find me, the real me, and proved that she exists. I’d  almost forgotten…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is what I mean. We’re both weird like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then we’d better stick together. I’m sure you’d relapse without me around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah… I know, already. Besides, you just said you’re the same. Pretty defensive, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you keep calling me weird. I feel obliged to be defensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You are weird, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That doesn’t mean you can call me weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Okay, okay. Can I call you weird?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked. “Well… I guess that’s fine…” <em>Actually,  when you talk about us both in the same sentence, the same word, as  being similar, it’s nice. But I can’t tell you that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname laughed. “You’re pretty ridiculous,” she said good-naturedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, well, even if you can say it I still have the right to be defensive about it. That’s only fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, hey!” Amiki shouted from the other side of the room. “What are you lovebirds talking about now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re  speculating about when you and Olesa are going to get together,” Momomi  replied, pretty sure she had Amiki’s number on that one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ha. Well, I wouldn’t expect you to understand.” Amiki turned away and attacked the floor in her mop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi felt a little guilty as she walked back towards the body of the group. <em>After  all, I’m in that kind of situation and it’s troublesome for me, so I’m  trying to hide it from Kaname. If I really have judged the situation  right and Olesa doesn’t know, aren’t I endangering Amiki in the same  way I so fear? Well, she’s persisting in her accusations even though  they’re now close to half true, so I guess it’s a case of two people  living by the sword. </em>She gave Olesa a speculative look. <em>If that  was the case, what would the case be for you? Would you know or would  you be oblivious? What would you do? Would you return those feelings?  Would you be embarrassed or disgusted? Would you just ignore the whole  issue and pretend it hadn’t been raised? Actually, you’re the kind of  person who’d do that even if you were pining away for her inside. It’d  interfere with your important, self-sacrificial life plan. If that’s  the case, I’d definitely have to interfere. But aren’t I getting ahead  of myself? I should probably fix my own messed up love life before I  starting thinking about others.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a serious point, though,” Shion said. “I’m very offended, Kiyashiki-san. It appears you find our company pretty arduous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  nothing like that. Well, maybe a little. But sometimes I need a little  time to think stuff over. Unlike a lot of people, I think a lot before  I take action.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And my job is to stop her from thinking for too long,” Kaname said calmly. “It’s definitely bad for her. She gets broody.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, aren’t you the same? You were very broody indeed not so long ago and you didn’t say a word to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah,  yeah. You’re worse than me, though. I look over my shoulder and my  cover from the malicious words of Amiki and a certain senpai is  inspecting the wall as if it’s the greatest work of art since… what’s  it… that picture of the frumpy woman with the druggy smile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The Mona Lisa?” Shion suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s the one. You’re proof of my powers of description.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More like an insult to a great masterpiece, both of you,” Olesa muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, you shouldn’t take things so seriously, Kiyashiki-san,” Shion  said. “You’re young, there’s no time for thinking or doubting. Isn’t  playing it by the ear more fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You say that with your  happy-go-lucky persona, but that’s hardly the real you,” Momomi said.  “And I know that you’re the last person who can talk about doing  without thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion laughed. “Okay, you do have me there. I  still think it’s good advice, though. I’m notoriously bad at following  my own good advice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll bear that in mind…” Momomi looked  around for a moment, smiling slightly, then stepped closer to Kaname.  “So…” she looked up at her friend, voice soft. “What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About spending some time with these guys for an indeterminate future?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  cocked her head, thinking about it. In front of them, Shion argued with  Olesa about the artistic merits of the Mona Lisa. “I guess I could get  used to it. They’re not at our level, but they’re pretty weird too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “That’s good enough for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, and not the guy. We don’t do guys in this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smirked. “On so many levels, my friend. On so many levels.”</span></p>
