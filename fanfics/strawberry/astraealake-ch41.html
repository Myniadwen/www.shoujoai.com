<p><em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">You’re worrying me, Momomi. </span></em>Kaname looked at her friend, seeing her absent face and faraway eyes. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">I  can’t quite put my finger on it, but I’m worried about you, and I’m not  sure why. You’re brooding, and it’s not like you to brood. No,  actually, you brood a lot, but you always have a reason. Generally,  it’s your parents. Sometimes it was Olesa and Amiki. A few times I was  the one who made you worry. But you won’t tell me your fears and that,  in itself, makes me just a little afraid. More than that…I guess  there’s a childish annoyance there, as well. It’s not like I can talk,  as you’d put it, I hide secrets within myself to protect my dignity,  but I wouldn’t mind if you didn’t. If you could trust me. Of course, I  trust you and I don’t speak… so I’m just being hypocritical. </span></em>She sighed, then frowned when Momomi didn’t appear to notice. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It  makes me feel a little ignored, I suppose. Which is another illogical  feeling. And I worry about you, which is novel in itself. You’re the  first person I’ve ever really had to worry about, apart from myself,  and it’s a very strange experience. It’s a little frustrating. At least  when you’re looking after yourself you know what’s wrong and what  you’re going to do about it. No, on the other hand…perhaps that isn’t  always true. But still. You have a level of understanding and awareness  of the problem. But you’re good at creating a smooth surface to hide  your depths, and I’m no good at all at seeing past the reflection and  into the real person, however much I wish that I could be perceptive  like you. In other words, I don’t know anything at all, and I’m  obsessed with this uncertain feeling. It’s not very pleasant.</span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>But I should probably worry about you, not me, shouldn’t I? That’s what you’d do. </em>Kaname glanced at her friend and tried to think of something to say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a beautiful night, isn’t it?” Momomi remarked, as if reading her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah. I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The  sky’s very clear… I wonder whether we’ll be able to see the stars  later, if we stand in the right place, between the school and the town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so,” Kaname replied. “I don’t see why not. But why the sudden interest? Thinking of joining the Astronomy Club?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do we have one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We have two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Spica  and Miator’s club, which is very professional and precise,” Kaname  explained. “They schedule meetings and use telescopes and take notes  and record observational data. I’m pretty sure the senpais write papers  on something or other, too, and they subscribe to journals and  everything else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sounds like our school. I can imagine Shion doing that, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  then Lulim has a club, which is broadly the “go and look at the stars,  eat some sandwiches and drink hot tea” society. Or, to put it another  way, the night-time division of the cloud-watching club.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  smiled. “These moments come rarely, but sometimes I do wonder whether  they’re the ones who have it right after all. If we had a  cloud-watching club, it would be based on measurements and experimental  data and focus on meteorology.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I think there is such a club…” Kaname frowned. “Or am I just thinking of a subsection of the Geography Club?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  laughed. “In any case, you take my point. I can understand the  importance of standards and hard work. But once a month, I have my  Lulim day, when I don’t want to strain myself. Letting life come as it  wants to is more fun in those moments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Once a month? Like a werewolf?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, quite. I’m sure it must be a pretty traumatic transformation to witness.” Momomi smiled knowingly at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Somehow, Kaname felt happy. “Nah. It’s kinda fun to watch.” <em>Because she’s looking at me?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, this is a good night to watch the stars lazily.” Momomi looked upwards. “That’s what I feel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smiled and stuck her hands in her pockets, enjoying the feel of the breeze ruffling her hair. <em>It’s a strange thing, but it’s easier to be happy when she’s happy. It makes the world seem right.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  I was thinking about that,” Momomi said thoughtfully. “I’ve been here  at Astraea Hill for so many months now. On a hill, in the middle of  nowhere, with relatively few artificial lights. Except for the town,  I’ll grant, but it’s a lot better than a lot of other environments for  stargazing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so. I don’t think that was the design  intention, though. I thought we were in the middle of nowhere so  kidnappers at least had to do some extra legwork to get here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled. “You’re as cynical as always. It’s not very romantic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  practical, though, isn’t it?” Kaname scratched her cheek. “That’s why  we make good friends. You can do all your fluffy poetry and romantic  notions and bunnies and things, and I’m here to wield the line rule of  cruel truth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Actually, I’d characterise your contribution as  destructive pessimism,” Momomi teased. “But you’re right, there’s a  necessary balance, all the same. Just as you’re the strong one and I’m  the one who knows how people work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. It’s not like I don’t know the gist,” Kaname said lightly. “I just have problems translating theory to reality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, my original point was that I’ve been here all this time, but  I only thought of stargazing just now.” Momomi looked up again. “Just  now, when I happened to look up at the sky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m not surprised. It’s not exactly a usual hobby, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When  I think about it, though, it’s something I would have enjoyed all  along. I just didn’t notice it.” Momomi glanced at her. “Do you have  things like that? When you only abruptly notice something that had been  there all along?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. Its called being human.” Kaname  shrugged. “I mean, kendo was always there but I didn’t ever think to  join. Not really. It was interesting when I did, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  guess it is a human thing,” Momomi agreed, looking away. “It’s hard to  know whether to be pleased with the discovery or annoyed that you  missed it all along.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Why take it so seriously?  It’s just a thing, if you know what I mean. It doesn’t make a great of  difference either way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smirked and closed her eyes, knowing what came next. <em>When  Momomi gets that far-away look in her eyes…not the one that says she’s  brooding, but the one that says she’s looking at the world itself and  thinking the way she does, about everything it. It’s always interesting  to hear what she says, knowing she trusts me enough to say it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  all the same,” Momomi began. “It’s a little depressing as well. There’s  a lot of… potential in this world. There’s so many hobbies out there we  could enjoy, interests and interesting things to do, fascinating places  and films and books and who knows what, and the people as well, friends  and partners and superiors and subordinates and jobs and… everything. A  place in the world. All that stuff is out there somewhere, it has to  be. But the odds of us encountering even a fraction of it are so  incredibly long. More than that, even if we saw it, we probably  wouldn’t recognise it until it was too late, and it was gone. You  know?” Momomi smiled self-effacingly. “The thought gives me a very  desolate feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted, but she couldn’t help but smile all the same. “You really do think too much for your own good, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  can’t help it,” Momomi pouted. “It’s just the way I am, you know? I  think about things. Which is more than a lot of people do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  you’re right, of course. And that’s just the way it is, until such time  as we become immortal.” Kaname looked thoughtful for a moment. “Which  is why Jesus always annoyed me… I mean, he proves he can’t die, then he  flies off to heaven. Not only did he miss out on the chance to  experience life forever, but he left mankind completely in the lurch.  Look at us. Was this in the plan? Was it? Come down here and sacrifice  yourself again, there’s a lot more of us now and we’ve invented nuclear  bombs too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed. “You’re still busy with your own  agenda. But I guess it’s just the way things are. Sometimes I think  that’s another argument against God in itself. This world’s just so  imperfect…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You say that, but wouldn’t it get kinda boring if we  just enjoyed everything in life? I mean, when you first read books  every one is a classic, right? But after a while, your taste starts to  mature, and with understanding comes the loss of that innocent  pleasure.” Kaname looked up at the sky herself. “It sounds cliché, but  there wouldn’t be any way to appreciate the good stuff in the life if  it was all good stuff. And the thousands of wonderful things we’ll  never experience lends the few we do extra weight, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  studied her face for a few moments, then nodded, smiling slightly.  “You’re right, I guess. Even if you’re wrong, it’s a less depressing  way of thinking about things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly! Who’s the pessimist now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  if I’m feeling philosophical… I mean, really philosophical. Totally cut  lose from reality.” Kaname smiled. “Sometimes I think we’re the lucky  ones. Because we’ve experienced some of the worst aspects of life,  isolation and abuse and the need to fight, we can retain our childlike  pleasure when things do go right. More than that, we appreciate how  wrong things can be. It’s a fuller experience of life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  definitely a lot more philosophy than I ever think I could live by,”  Momomi said teasingly. “And it sounds like Kaname’s just the same.  Otherwise she wouldn’t be jealous of Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. But it’s an interesting thought experiment, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Friendship is… being able to say stuff like that without feeling like a complete idiot.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled. “I guess you really are the optimistic one, despite my prior beliefs. It’d be great if you could always be that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah, but that’d leave you unable to appreciate me, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps,  but I don’t think so. People will always be greedy. People will always  want as much as they can take… and I don’t think it’s always a bad  thing. The belief that what you have will never age or stale… that’s  very naïve and endearing. But we never stop aspiring, either. Eternal  optimism means we’re never satisfied with what we have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Without optimism there’s no aspiration and no movement.” Kaname said, shrugging. “So I wouldn’t change that, all the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  nodded. “Only stagnation. Is that ever a good choice? To just let  things be, even if risking what you have is a necessary stake to chance  on a greater thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not a matter of a good or bad choice,”  Kaname remarked. “It’s just a choice. There’s no point in  over-analysing stuff like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose that’s true,” Momomi conceded. “What would you do, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It depends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi rolled her eyes. “That’s a surprisingly wishy-washy answer, coming from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But,”  Kaname added. “As I was going to say, before I was interrupted, I’m  more inclined to take risks than not. That’s why a wishy-washy answer,  coming from you. I’d rather fail decisively, struggling to obtain  something, than sit and stew in mediocrity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wish I was like that,” Momomi mused. “Mediocrity feels so much safer, it’s hard to leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  not mediocre, and you’re stupid if you think you are. Your parents. You  struggled and won.” Kaname folded her arms. “You can do so again if you  have to. I know it. Because you’re not a normal person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed. “Kaname wouldn’t be interested in a normal person, now would she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah. In that respect… it’s one of the areas where I’m… cautious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About  making friends?” Momomi giggled. “A little more than that, I think.  You’re an outstanding person who should have many friends. Even with  your awkward personality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, of course.” Kaname shrugged.  “Some would say I’m cowardly, but I think they’re idiots. To say one  way’s better than another, that’s a false statement. People always say  it’s better to live intensely and take risks, but they’re just  projecting social expectations and favouring the more dramatic choice.  Eternal optimists believe in happy endings, but it’s mostly those who  receive the happy endings that say… how’s it phrased…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“<em>It’s better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all</em>,” Momomi said. “That?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  think so,” Kaname said carefully, feeling her English strain. “But  that’s the kind of thing. It’s not something people who have loved and  lost in recent times would say. Mostly it’s just a platitude for  comfort or encouragement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because there is no necessity to  socialise in this world,” Momomi observed. “All the same, we’re both  pretty clear that it’s better we became friends than not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Better  is a subjective term, isn’t it? Life’s more enjoyable, of course. But  we also have more risks.” Kaname ran a hand through her hair  thoughtfully. “So we had our happy ending… if you’d been taken back to  Italy, I would have wished I hadn’t come to like your company.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re very… guarded.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  reckless with my body but careful with my heart,” Kaname admitted.  “That’s because flesh wounds heal, but if you let people in, you’re  open.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Surely if you shelter yourself like that, you’ll never grow, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  you know as well,” Kaname pointed out. “You know what it feels like, to  be betrayed in the worst way possible by someone you trusted with all  your heart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know,” Momomi admitted. “And it hurt. But I can’t let that define my life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know,” Kaname echoed. “That’s the thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  giving me very mixed messages, you know. First you advocate being hurt  to highlight the good in this world, then you advocate social  isolationism to prevent pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not advocating it as such,” Kaname said. “I’m just saying it’s a perfectly legitimate option.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm. But what do you think? As Kaname Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t know.” Kaname sighed. “When I was a little younger, before I met  you, I thought I had all the answers. Now I’m not sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned and looked away. “At least you made some improvement, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But I do know one thing. I’m glad I became your friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked at the floor and smiled slightly. “Thanks. I’m… glad too. Very glad…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  gave her an uncomfortable look. “Don’t sound too weepy. It makes you  sound like you’re going to be kidnapped or assassinated or something.  Or one of those characters who intends to run off and fight some  mystical battle or whatever and then die unless I run after you and  find my world destroyed-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re closer to the truth than you think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi stuck her tongue out. “Don’t worry, I’m not a magical girl. Or should I say sorry to disappoint you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ha.”  Kaname smirked. “Of course not. Magical girls believe in love and peace  and crap like that… they’d never make a harrion like you one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted. “Well, you’re the same, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. It’s not like I want to be one, either. If you think I’m going through a near-naked transformation sequence for <em>anybody’s </em>money, you need to think again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course… but we’d probably make good bad guys in a show like that. You know, the angsty dark girl with a gloomy past.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Making yourself into a tragic heroine much? You have way too much taste for melodrama, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not a heroine,” Momomi retorted. “Never a heroine. Heroines generally annoy me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname chuckled. “Same here. But we’re way too competent to be bad guys. They always lose in the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You know, I’d love to read a story when they won.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You would, of course. Well, I guess I would too.” Momomi laughed again. “It’d make a change, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi glanced at her. “But thanks for talking to me, Kaname. I’ve had a lot to think about and it’s good to hear your views.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Did I help you solve it?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not  at all,” Momomi replied, laughing. “I’m way more confused than before.  But I think it’s okay to be confused now. As you’d say, it’s not good  or bad, just a human thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, a lot of things are like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  spent the rest of the time walking to town talking about less serious  things, more or less whatever came to mind. But that felt just fine,  too. <em>No one has to be deep all the time. That’d just be plain tiring. </em>Kaname glanced at Momomi, who was chatting away happily about the more irritating properties of romance heroines. <em>But  all the same, I’ve always been amazed at our capacity to just… talk.  I’m hardly a sociable person, I don’t have very good conversational  skills, but things just come to mind when I’m around Momomi. And I’m  never afraid to say them. </em>She replied teasingly. <em>Momomi’s  pretty much the same. It’s enjoyable to be able to just talk. Normally  it’s tiring, but with her it’s different. When people talk about the  pleasures of conversation, I actually know what they mean. I used to  talk functionally and defensively, to operate in society and to protect  myself. The idea that I could be like this, and just talk…and talk…and  talk…and even more than that, to listen as well, it’s novel. Is  everyone this interesting if you get through to you? I mean, I can talk  with the other three, but it’s not the same. I suppose I let them lead,  and I generally limit myself to sarcastic replies. I couldn’t present  my deepest thoughts the same way. Friends and best friends, is it?  They’re completely different…not that I enjoy calling Amiki a friend.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The  town was quiet and the cinema quieter, which was to be expected. Kaname  tapped her feet while Momomi paid for both of them and tried not to  think of what people might be thinking of them. <em>No fault of our  own. Just the very long shadow of a school lead by the cross-national,  cross-class, same-gender anomalies called Serané and Kariya. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked around as the entered the almost empty cinema. “Where do you want to sit?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  shrugged, looking around. “Anywhere is good, I suppose. Its not like  it’s too crowded, and I don’t really care. Isn’t today your day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Okay.” Momomi grabbed her hand and dragged her to a seat in the back row, sitting down herself and smiling. “How about here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, sure…” Kaname said, looking a little puzzled. “Why here, though? Surely you’d get a better view further forwards?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is fine, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged again and sat. “Whatever. It’s your film you want to see, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  still being all cool and indifferent,” Momomi teased. “I’ve always  found it hard to work out whether you care about anything at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey,  hey, don’t you remember?” Kaname prodded her friend playfully. “I have  two modes, things that are worth getting physically hurt over, and  things that aren’t worth getting physically hurt over. It’s one or the  other, so I have to care about very few things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m glad  I’m not being hit repeatedly in the face for my seating preferences,  but do you have to be so discerning?” Momomi grinned. “Would it hurt  you too much to have a middle category? You know, the one normal people  keep everything in…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “That just makes me think  they don’t really care about anything. I prefer focusing my energy on a  few things, no more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess when your empathy is so thin anyway, you have to conserve it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. Tell me you’re any different…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, fine. But I don’t act cool all the time. Much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The lights darkened as the trailers began, to Kaname’s chagrin. After the third she rolled her eyes and sighed audibly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What’s up?” Momomi asked quietly, leaning in to her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing in particular,” Kaname said. “I’m just annoyed that we don’t get decent trailers for this kind of film.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I’m pretty sure you can’t legally watch the films it sounds like you’d  really enjoy, anyway. Action and horror and stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  chuckled. “Well, yeah. Never stopped me before. Besides, the lighter  kind of action films are okay, and I’m on the tall side. You’re the one  who’s screwed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi turned back to the screen and frowned. “Doesn’t that just mean I won’t have to go with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tush.”  Kaname scowled. “I’ll find a way. I mean, if I ask Shion she’ll  probably provide a trenchcoat, a hat and a quick lesson in voice  deepening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Probably,” Momomi admitted. “In terms of plans, if not execution, she’s hyperactive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s not the point, though. In films like this, you don’t get-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shush. You’re interrupting the nice man shooting out the car with an assault rifle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Say  what?” Kaname’s head snapped round and found an action film had finally  found its way to the screen. “How much of that did I miss?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Most  of it. You were busy bitching about how there weren’t any decent films  being previewed, and I didn’t have it in me to stop you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why not?” Kaname demanded. “Isn’t that the fair thing to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled in the half-darkness. “I was too busy being paralysed by the efficiency of universal karma…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Cruel girl. Isn’t the film enough?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, relax, Kaname,” Momomi teased, prodding her on the shoulder. “You might even like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  doubted that, but wasn’t going to say anything. She still gave it her  full attention when the film began proper, if only to be able to hold  up her side of a conversation at the end of it. <em>Damned if I’m going to let Momomi say I didn’t understand it, or something. I have my pride. </em>She frowned at the screen. <em>But  it looks quite simple, really. Girl moves out of house, guy moves into  house. Letter left from one to the other. I’m not an expect but I can  read the writing on the wall, they’ll be together by the end. How  predictable. Where’s the tension in that? Anyway, so…something about an  attic…hmm. Looks like someone smashed up his house. How annoying. Is he  being targeted by the intelligence agency he abandoned a year ago? I  wish… nope…instead…a time travelling post-box. Right. Say what?! </em>Kaname bit her thumb. <em>Any  particular reason for that? Perhaps it’s a military secret or  something…I mean, how valuable would that be from a strategic  perspective? An American general could post a letter to his past  comrades, telling them not to do the whole Vietnam thing </em>again. <em>Honestly,  though, two years… now that’s what I call a long-distance relationship.  Shion and Isae, be humbled. And there’s this whole time-travelling  flirting thing going on, but I’m not sure I’m following. Let’s see…  something about a map and a guy and a girl who aren’t the guy and the  girl… love rivals, but in different time periods. Well, that’s another  way to be safe from vengeful people. If you look at it the other way,  though, if you have your girl stolen from you by a guy who isn’t even  in the same time period, you really do fail at life. No, somehow they  were in the same place this time…God this is confusing. No, of course,  she exists in the future and the past even if he’s only in the  past…but, no, he’s in the future as well. Probably. If she stabbed his  past self with her past self, would the universe implode? Now that’d be  an interesting ending…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned. <em>Okay, by now I’ve  completely lost the plot. On the plus side, I don’t care. Could you  mail yourself into the past or the future using that box? I guess it’s  not big enough, but what if you put yourself in a box next to the  post-box, with the correct stamps and all, would that work? I mean, to  all intents and purposes that’s the same… come to that, is it really  the post-box which is the active dimension of time travel, or would  that be the postman? Could this be part of some government conspiracy,  channelled through the postal service? I mean, time travel can’t just  come out of nowhere, like blood from a stone or something. Only the  government would have the means and the reasons and the connections to  the postal service to develop it, but that still leaves the question of  their motive. Why on earth would they spend so much time fucking with  these two people? Perhaps I’m looking at this the wrong way…the  present-day government may have no reason, but a government from the  future with the power of time travel might. They’d more plausibly have  the technology, too, so that solves a lot of problems. In that case,  it’s a Terminator scenario. The child of these two weird people will be  a super-genius who invents time travel and so brings about a new world  order, or is important to the new world in a very fundamental way.  Perhaps he saves the world. This might not be a unique scenario,  though. Is it meant to represent hundreds of similar tales across the  country, as the future ensures the existence of its leaders? That leads  to a time paradox, but this movie’s already knee-deep in them anyway.  This’d probably be the many-universes type…no, perhaps this isn’t a  matter of time travel. What if the letters themselves aren’t moved in  time, but the people are moved to new universes each time, which happen  to include the letters? God, perhaps these two really are the parents  of a super-genius, it’s hell to think about even in genre terms, forget  experiencing it…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And those were the sort of thoughts that  preoccupied me for most of time,” Kaname admitted afterwards. “I sorta  lost track of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed. “Trust you to overanalyse everything. Can’t you just say it’s a magic post-box and leave it at that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  intellectually lazy,” Kaname complained. “Even magic has to have rules,  you know. I don’t like people who abstract such things to hand-waving  forces, as if they did exist, I’m sure they’d follow fundamental laws  just like anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that makes sense on its own terms, but not in the context of this movie. You were rather missing the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged. “Well, if you don’t think about this stuff just a little, the point in itself won’t make sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  if you think about this stuff for very long, the point in itself will  make even less sense,” Momomi pointed out, leading her friend out. “I’m  just glad you weren’t paying enough attention to spot the multiple time  paradoxes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So am I. I was having a hard enough time for  myself…” Kaname glanced at her friend. “Well? What was it like? I don’t  really know, after all that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi shrugged. “Well, it was  nonsensical at times and merely mind-bending at others, but I guess it  was cute. The ending was nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“One day, they should release the sequel,” Kaname said. “Showing them breaking up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re still cold and cynical at heart, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of  course. But realistic. I mean, they’ve barely talked to each other,  except in time-travelling letters. They’re practically strangers,  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, isn’t that the best way to start a romantic relationship?” Momomi asked. “At least they have nothing to lose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Except  the space-time continuum,” Kaname smirked. “Honestly, apart from any  other consideration, I’d stop with the letters just to avoid the  destruction of time as we know it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s an unusually sensible attitude from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I can be reckless with myself, but the universe is something else altogether, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  laughed. “You say that, but you’d still use it to get future stock  market figures and invest with an eye to them. Just like me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname chuckled. “I hadn’t even thought of that… evil girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  prefer the term practical. I mean, if you’re gonna hook up with your  girl from the future, you might as well be loaded when you do.” Momomi  frowned and pulled out her remaining change. “And speaking of that…  let’s see. I’ve still got some change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you going to add it to the rest you saved?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Like  hell,” Momomi said. “I may have some of the rest left, but I’ll  exorcise this much before the day’s out. It’ll make me feel a little  better about myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned. “Well, I don’t get your  logic, but considering that’ll satisfy you as well, it’s almost getting  two-for-one. Normal people always have an itch whenever they spend  money so freely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s because I want to be normal like that that I don’t have such an itch. If you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not really. You’re making less sense than the film.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted. “Now that’s just harsh. Take that back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right. Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I should think so too…” Momomi looked around her as they walked back. “Let’s see… what shall I buy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How about food?” Kaname suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why food? We spent a lot on that already today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  just a motto of mine. When in doubt, buy food. It’s harder to steal and  even if they do take it from you, they probably won’t want it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed at the thought. “No-one’s quite like you for flipping between optimism and pessimism. You’re almost bipolar.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged and smiled. “Don’t blame me. It’s a crazy world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you make even crazier…” Momomi looked around and spotted a florists. “Aha. That’ll do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Flowers?” Kaname asked cynically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I like flowers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Can’t  you just go and look at the Etoile greenhouse again?” Kaname frowned.  “The last time I was in there, mind, Kariya was shouting at your  father…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s the clash of dominant personalities for you.” Momomi stepped forwards. “I’ll be right back. Wait here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned slightly at the instruction, annoyed that she was left behind. <em>What’s  up with that? I even went to the film…maybe I upset her with my  reflections on the nature of time travel. Yeah, right…I guess she just  doesn’t think I’d be interested in flowers. Which is true. No need to  think too deeply. </em>She folded her arms and tapped her heels impatiently. <em>Though  I’d prefer to be in there making sarcastic comments than out here in  the cold. I’m just glad I wore something warm. It’s still odd, though.  I mean, she dragged me through all the clothes shopping and stuff. But  then again, she needed me to be her model for that. I can’t imagine  that with flowers. </em>For some reason, the mental image of Momomi sticking various flowers in her hair came to mind, making her smirk. <em>Now  there’s a horrible thought. The worst thing is the fact that I can see  her going it. Something white would suit me, I guess. Yellow for her,  or maybe red. A red rose? Nope, too many hilarious mental images. Must  not think of Momomi with a red rose between her teeth… too late. Now  that’s be a brilliant sight. Sounds just like Kariya, if only she  smiled. But it’s something Serané forced on her…or something Momomi  would force on me. That’d be terrible. But pretty funny, I’ll admit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Eventually, Momomi came back, clutching a bouquet of some kind. “Sorry to keep you waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not a problem,” Kaname said automatically, craning her neck to see the flowers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted and hide them behind her back. “No peaking. I spent some time on this, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Whatever. Shall we get back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In a minute. Can we go somewhere first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Where?” Kaname asked wearily. “It’s getting late, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To the park, just for a little while. I want to sit down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “You just spent an hour and a half sitting down in the cinema, you know. You really are unhealthy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. Can we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, today’s your day,” Kaname said, raising her hands in surrender. “Just make it quick.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  nodded and smiled enthusiastically, running towards the park while  doing the best to keep the bouquet out of sight. Kaname shook her head  and followed more slowly, watching her run with her peculiar grace. <em>She’s  at that age, just young enough to be able to run while remaining just  old enough to look pretty while doing it. Society’s expectations will  demand that we walk everywhere soon enough.</em> With that thought in  her mind, Kaname changed her mind and chased after her, only to find  Momomi sitting on a bench under the light of a lamppost. She sat next  to her, watching as Momomi finally brought the bouquet into her lap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  touched the flowers almost gently. “You know, my mother loves flowers.  They’re one of her few pleasures in life, and she knows a lot about  them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She seems the type, I guess,” Kaname admitted. “Do you like them too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A  little, I guess. I’m sure you think that’s obnoxiously feminine of me.”  Momomi shrugged. “But she taught me both the European flower language  and Hanakotoba.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That must get confusing, to know both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Less  than knowing more than one language, because the similarities are  striking. It’s a redundant language, though. Very few people can read  the messages you send by flowers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Is that sending a message, then?” Kaname asked. “You have enough different types of flowers…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  is, of course,” Momomi said. “I guess I do it as a smug kind of thing,  even if I’m the only one to understand. That’s why I selected something  like this, which isn’t very aesthetically pleasing. I chose it to  represent my feelings. But in any case, can you guess?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Red roses… isn’t that for love?” Kaname hazarded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly. But that’s the easy one, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So this is for your mysterious cute girl…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Come on. Try guessing some more flowers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname stared at them for a few moments, then shrugged in defeat. “Sorry. I’m no good at this stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  pouted. “What a waste. Well, pink roses are for grace, trust and  confidence. But they’re mostly there because I like the colour. There  are two kinds of tulips, too. Red means a declaration of love in  Europe, though it’s trust again among other things in Japan. Yellow  means unrequited love in both… that’s what I think my crush is, you  see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I see,” Kaname said slowly, surprised at her frankness. “That’s too bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Daffodil  is unrequited love as well, but also respect and chivalry. And yellow  roses are there for the same reasons. Friendship and a hopelessly love.  A little jealousy, too, for what’s represented by the one blue rose. An  impossible dream.” Momomi looked at the floor. “It’s a very chaotic  bouquet, like my feelings, and it’s a little sad as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname tried to find something to say, and failed miserably. <em>I’m  hopeless at this kind of stuff. I’m flattered she can tell me, but it  pains me that she can say so much and I can find no reply at all. It’s  not nice to see her upset… who the hell is this girl, anyway? It’s hard  to forgive anyone who makes Momomi melancholy.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But it’s not  all bad.” Momomi looked at her with wavering eyes. “Red roses and  yellow roses together, two of the most numerous of the flowers, they  mean joy and excitement. Whatever else happens, I’ll hold onto that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It sounds… hard,” Kaname observed lamely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s why the film was bittersweet. It’s like you said, life isn’t that convenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It never is, is it?” Kaname began to see what was coming next, and somehow there was nothing to say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah.  Well, it can’t be helped, can it?” Momomi tried to force some  cheerfulness into her voice. “We have to live in that world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname just nodded slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi thrust her arm out without looking at her. “Here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname took the bouquet slowly, staring at it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  yours,” Momomi explained, her voice low. She was looking at a specific  point on the ground, about as far from Kaname as you could look without  twisting your neck. “Yours to keep. Because… you’re her. You’re the  girl I like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname was shocked, but not as much as she thought she would be. <em>Somehow, I knew, I think. But I never acknowledged it, not even in my head. </em>“I… see.” She tried to find something to say. “Since when?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That one time,” Momomi said vaguely. “With you… just out of the shower…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname winced at the memory. “That long?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You owe me a reply, you know,” Momomi said in a very small voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>And I knew it would come to that, as well. I didn’t want to have to say it. </em>“I’m… sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed shortly, an exhalation, something entirely without genuine mirth. “You don’t have to apologise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m still sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  fine!” Momomi said, a little too forcefully. She recovered herself,  then stood, still looking anywhere but Kaname. Which was just as well,  as Kaname was looking anywhere but her. “I… expected that outcome. But  we can still remain friends. It’s fine. Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah.” <em>If it’s fine, then why is your voice breaking like that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case. I guessed I’d better get back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Right.” Kaname stood hurriedly. “You’re right… it’s pretty late. We need to get back to school-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname.” Momomi’s voice was fragile. “I want to… I need to…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s fine,” Kaname said automatically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname watched her leave, and felt like screaming inside. <em>No,  it’s not fine. It’s not fine and I know it! So I should say something,  do something, call her back! I shouldn’t leave her like this, but I’m  going to, because I’m afraid. It’s easier to let her walk away. It’s  easier to pretend there’s nothing wrong. There’s more I should say,  more I should do. Reassure her, thank her, something! </em>Kaname  raised a hand, but words failed her for the fiftieth time that night.  She let her hand slump to her side again, face twisting with  self-disgust.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Sure, I know what I should do.</em><em>But all I can do is watch her retreating back.</em></span></p>
