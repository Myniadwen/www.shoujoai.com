<h1>Strawberry Panic! Hanabi (part 5 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cradlerobber.html">Cradlerobber Speedo-kun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/hanabi-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>It was not something she was going to admit. Hikari sat, patiently and 
quietly, listening to the presidents of the three schools explain and 
discuss issues regarding Astraea. But she was terribly bored, and the 
meager bento lunches that had been provided had not managed to 
completely fill her. From the corner of her eye she could see Amane; the 
other girl, however, was not secretive in her boredom &#150; it instead 
gleamed fairly clearly on her face. But it did not seem that the 
presidents cared.

On the other three sides of the table sat the presidents: Chikaru, 
Moriyama Mami, and Kitagawa Yurika. Mami and Yurika were bickering 
bitterly, their shrill voices seeming to expand infinitely in the damp 
air while Chikaru remained mostly silent, an amused smirk on her face. 
Mami and Yurika were happily carrying on the traditional rivalry between 
Miator and Spica.

&quot;Well, I think that this year Miator should be permitted to host the 
combined sports&#39; festival! I can&#39;t think of the last time anyone other 
than Spica got to do so!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot; Yurika laughed sarcastically, &quot;Why would anyone 
other than Spica do it? Spica excels in sports &#150; Miator is more for the 
quiet academics &#150; don&#39;t you have your own little cultural festival to be 
concerned with?&quot;

&quot;Cultural festival? You know full well that le Rim has that this year! 
Miator doesn&#39;t have a single festival scheduled yet!&quot;

&quot;So figure out your own festival! You can&#39;t just go around stealing 
ours, can&#39;t you guys think of anything? I thought you were supposed to 
be smart &#150; isn&#39;t that what Miator is all about?&quot;

&quot;Cultural festival, sports&#39; festival... what on earth is left after 
that?! I wish someone would tell me why our cultural festival got taken 
away in the first place!&quot;

&quot;Now, now...&quot; Chikaru interrupted with a smile, &quot;Unfortunately, the 
festivals were decided by the dearly departed Miyuki and Shion, so at 
this point it is a bit impossible to alter them. Moriyama, there is 
still the early summer festival, no one is doing that yet, and I 
personally would be happy to have Miator do that one &#150; would you like 
to?&quot;

Mami looked sulkily towards Chikaru, pausing before finally admitting a 
grudging, &quot;Yes.&quot;

At the other side of the table, Yurika preened, her smile altogether 
too-full of teeth.

&quot;Well,&quot; Chikaru clapped her hands together, &quot;Now that that is 
straightened away, I think we should leave further discussion until next 
meeting &#150; we have run a bit over, and I&#39;m sure Hikari and Amane have 
other things to attend to.&quot; She turned to the Etoile, &quot;Correct?&quot;

Amane seemed relieved as she answer, &quot;Yes, we have to get over to the 
green house before dark.&quot; She stood, taking Hikari&#39;s hand as she did so, 
&quot;Good evening.&quot;

Hikari inclined her head before departing, &quot;I hope you have a good 
evening.&quot;

Past the door, Amane let her arm fall lightly on Hikari&#39;s shoulders, 
bringing the younger girl closer to herself. Hikari smiled in the sunset 
colors, leaning her head against Amane&#39;s arm. After all that had 
happened the previous year, she felt lucky, walking there as the Etoile 
with Amane all to herself. Amane had been an idol. Hikari had fallen for 
her even not knowing this, and that she had been the one to end up 
happily ever after in the end made her consider herself to be blessed. 
She had great friends, and a wonderful girlfriend &#150; was there any more 
she could ask for?

Her face darkened very slightly, and they passed outside into the 
cooling night air. She could ask that her room-mate would seem less 
strained when she was around. Yaya cared. And maybe that was exactly the 
problem, after all. She cared a lot.

Hikari certainly appreciated Yaya&#39;s affection. Yaya had reached out her 
hand to her room-mate in the beginning, the lonely beginning at St. 
Spica. She had been so upset after her mistake during the choir concert, 
but Yaya had cheered her up and stood there for her. And whenever Hikari 
had been shy, Yaya had made up for it by being extra-loud. Yaya had 
never been anything but wonderful.

Yet... Hikari did not forget the kiss. It had shocked her, and had 
imprinted itself upon her, searing a permanent placement in her memory. 
She felt that the repair of their friendship had been, in the end, 
superficial at best, even if it had been an emotional one. Yaya had not 
attended the Etoile ceremony.

But, truly, what could she do? She loved Yaya, yes, but she loved Yaya 
as a dear friend, not the love she was beginning to feel develop for 
Amane. She wanted to grow old with Amane &#150; and she wanted to always be 
able to call up Yaya and just speak with her. It was entirely different.

So, the friendship remained in a somewhat strained state. And it made 
her sad, but she could only sincerely wish it would pass. She knew it 
would be nearly impossible to simply talk it out with Yaya &#150; Hikari knew 
that she herself find it to difficult to even summon the topic, and she 
also knew Yaya would not be willing to stay around to discuss it. So 
things stayed the same.

&quot;You look a bit sad.&quot;

Hikari realized with a start that they were outside the greenhouse, and 
that they had come to a halt, the broad doors closed before them. She 
smiled, somewhat painfully, &quot;Ah, I&#39;m just thinking it&#39;ll be sad when the 
lilies die &#150; the season for them is almost over.&quot;

Amane patted her head slightly, a kind smile upon her face, &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
&#150; they&#39;ll come around again. And there are the roses &#150; they&#39;ll be coming 
into bloom as soon as those lilies fade.&quot; She opened the door to the 
greenhouse, gesturing for Hikari to step inside, &quot;I think you worry too 
much.&quot;

In the greenhouse, Hikari smiled watched Amane come in, &quot;You&#39;re probably 
right.&quot;

Amane slipped her arms around Hikari, wrapping the blonde girl in an 
embrace, and lowered her face. Hikari met her half-way and murmured, 
&quot;You&#39;re probably right...&quot;</pre>
