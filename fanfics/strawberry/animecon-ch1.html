<pre>Miyuki stirred.

Through sleepy eyes and the poorly lit haze of the dormitory, she 
struggled to orientate herself. Was she still asleep? Had she woken? 
Peering through slanted eyelids, she tried to find something familiar to 
focus on. The thick haze prevailed, offering nothing in the sub light as 
a point of reference, the shining crack between the heavy bedroom 
curtains too sharp, too bright for her tired eyes to process.

Giving up, she closed them again.

It must still be early she concluded and rolled onto her side, shifting 
under the bed covers, curling up for warmth. The room was cold, and her 
feet settled in an uncomfortably crisp part of the bed. The snow would 
be deep outside today.

Silence reigned, broken only by the steady tick of the wall clock.

With gradual realisation the previous days events crept slowly back into 
Miyuki&#39;s mind; the election ceremony, Shizuma dramatically eloping with 
Aoi-san, the embarrassment of facing the other student council members 
throughout the evening, the sinking feeling of guilt and regret that 
grew after each conversation and the marked absence of Tamao Suzumi that 
followed.

Miyuki sighed.

Abandoning the prospect of continued sleep under the heavy weight of her 
conscience, she opened her eyes, meaning to sit upright and stretch.

&quot;Good morning Miyuki.&quot;

The words were spoken straight into her ear, the soft purr close enough 
for her to feel the breath on her skin. The upperclassman started. She 
had no idea someone had been in the room with her, let alone so close.

Recognition sprung from the familiar voice, and Miyuki&#39;s heart jumped 
again.

Eyes wide, she tried to turn to the speaker, only to find herself unable 
as a slender arm encircled her waist, pulling her back against the soft 
body behind. Perfume filled her nostrils as wisps of hair brushed the 
back of her neck.

&quot;Shizuma?&quot;

She felt the arm around her waist tighten as gentle fingers stroked dark 
hair from her face, tracing the back of her neck, toying with her ear 
ring. The response came almost as a whisper, leaving Miyuki wondering if 
she&#39;d heard it at all.

&quot;Who else would it be Miyuki?&quot;

Warmth radiated from between the two girls, enveloping Miyuki as the 
sleepy haze had done only moments before. It was soothing, yet the 
student council president continued to face the wall, too worried to 
look at her companion.

&quot;What are you doing Shizuma?&quot;

Nervousness undercut her voice, and Miyuki bit her lip for letting it 
show.

&quot;You sound uneasy.&quot; The words came softly, but still telling and 
intrusive.

The breath on her neck followed the steady rise and fall of the chest 
she was pressed to, the proximity welcoming, enticing. She was acutely 
aware of the cool fingers gliding over her skin, sending shivers racing 
down her spine. Fear and arousal washed over her, the cocktail unnerving 
yet delicious.

The former-Etoile was obviously playing with her, this was wrong; out of 
character considering the previous day&#39;s events.

&quot;This isn&#39;t you Shizuma. What about yesterday?&quot;

&quot;What about yesterday?&quot; The reply was followed by gentle kisses that 
travelled the curve of her shoulder, dipping into the arch of her back. 
The hairs on Miyuki&#39;s neck stood on end.

Bewildered, she struggled to form a coherent reply, twisting but unable 
to move, trapped in Shizuma&#39;s embrace. Her roommate had rarely been this 
direct before, this physical. It was intoxicating.

Miyuki hung her head, almost scared to speak, frightened that she was 
still dreaming and yet petrified that she was awake.

&quot;You left so suddenly with Aoi-san. I didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to 
you.&quot;

&quot;Left with?&quot;

Soft kisses followed one another, and then after a pause, &quot;Miyuki, 
Aoi-san is Etoile now. I expect she was with Tamao all evening.&quot;

Slender fingers pushed the bed cover further down the young woman&#39;s arm, 
exposing warm flesh to the cool air. The soft murmur continued,

&quot;And I am here with you dear Miyuki, just as I&#39;m supposed to be.&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s mind struggled to maintain focus, drowning in sensations and 
confusion, a yawning pit of longing threatened to consume her rationale 
entirely.

&quot;But, that&#39;s not what - &quot;

A finger brushed against her breast, and an involuntary gasp escaped her 
lips.

&quot;This is what you wanted isn&#39;t it?&quot; Shizuma purred.

Finger tips circled slowly, then sunk deeper beneath the covers, 
reaching, probing.

&quot;Isn&#39;t this what you hoped for?&quot;

Sensations overwhelming her, the entrapped sixth grader surrendered, 
closing her eyes and relaxing into the welcoming darkness behind them.

&quot;After all...&quot;

Her skin tingled with each touch, the room swayed.

&quot;...with Nagisa gone, what choice did I have?&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s tone had changed, a sharp edge to the words. Miyuki&#39;s heart 
leapt to her throat as finger nails suddenly dug deeply into her arm, 
the pain searing. Miyuki winced.

&quot;Shizuma?&quot;

The warmth was gone as Shizuma withdrew, pulling away. Cold air rushed 
across Miyuki&#39;s back and she opened her eyes, twisting to sit upright. 
In the poor light and her unfocused daze, she couldn&#39;t see the 
former-Etoile clearly.

&quot;Shizuma?&quot;

A rush of air passed her ear, the loud clap of a hand across flesh 
filled the room. Miyuki flinched as pain raced across her face. She 
moved to shield herself as another blow landed from the opposite side.

Then another, and another.

&quot;Shizuma!&quot;

Miyuki screamed at the former-Etoile to stop, the sound ringing in her 
ears, yet drowned by the pain from the raining blows. The room swayed 
again, lurching unpleasantly before collapsing in on itself. Miyuki&#39;s 
world disappeared in disorientation.

Sitting bolt upright, her heart pounding, Miyuki suddenly snapped into 
sharp reality.

She sat alone in bed, sweating and naked amidst a disarray of soaked bed 
covers, her chest rising and falling as she gasped for breath.

Focusing, she looked around. The silent room stared back at her, cold 
and uncaring.

Unsettled, the young woman&#39;s shoulders sank.

Gathering the covers up around her, Miyuki pulled her legs into her 
chest, curling into a ball before resting her head on her knees. Her 
breathing slowed, her dark hair falling across her face.

The pit of her stomach twisted, a horrible feeling of stark loneliness 
and guilt washing over her.

&quot;Shizuma.&quot;

Long moments passed, marked only by the thoughts training through 
Miyuki&#39;s head.

Then, with a start she looked up at the clock. It was past nine. Panic 
hit her as she leapt from the bed and raced toward the bathroom.

The Etoile hand-over tour. She was late...

- - - - -

Hikari woke to the smell of lavender and the rhythmic sound of water 
drumming on the dormitory&#39;s perspex shower door. Soft singing floated 
from the bathroom, whose door stood slightly ajar, Yaya Nanto&#39;s sublime 
voice carrying from within.

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot;

Hikari sat up in bed as the sound of water came to a sudden stop, 
replaced by soft padding as Yaya moved around in the bathroom, rubbing 
herself down with a towel. The singing continued however, clearer than 
before.

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot; Hikari called.

The singing stopped, and a grinning face poked round the door.

&quot;So you&#39;re awake finally huh?&quot;

Yaya grinned, her wet hair a mess of long black strands, water dripping 
from the ends.

&quot;And how is Etoile-sama this morning?&quot;

Hikari blushed, unaccustomed to her new title. She pulled her knees up 
under the covers and sat with her back to the wall.

&quot;Yaya-chan wasn&#39;t here when I returned last night?&quot;

Yaya finished drying herself down and emerged from the bathroom, a blue 
and green towel wrapped tightly around her lithe form, covering far less 
of her thighs than it probably should have. She grabbed another towel 
from the back of her chair and tipped her head forward, patting her 
cascading hair dry. She regarded her roommate at an angle amongst a 
flurry of onyx and fabric.

&quot;Why the look of concern?&quot; Yaya grinned, &quot;Was Etoile-sama out so late 
last night that returning to find our room still empty should also be 
concerning?&quot;

Hikari blushed as Yaya teased further,

&quot;Perhaps I should be more worried as to what our new Etoile got up to on 
her first night in office!&quot;

Yaya righted herself, and stood for a moment, towel hanging from one 
hand, the other resting on her hip. There was a healthy glow to her 
cheeks, and a shine in her eyes that had been missing of late.

&quot;I&#39;m so proud of you Hikari.&quot;

The blonde haired third year looked down at the bed clothes in humility, 
the praise unwanted.

&quot;You&#39;re Etoile! Representative of all three schools of Astrea Hill.&quot;

Hikari&#39;s blue eyes peered back from beneath her straw coloured locks,

&quot;Amane-senpai won the election, not me. I&#39;m just glad to have been by 
her side.&quot;

Yaya scoffed, then continued to dry her hair.

&quot;One day you&#39;ll learn to be less modest Hikari. Amane-senpai wouldn&#39;t 
have gotten anywhere without your cute face.&quot; She paused, and then 
cocked her head in concern. &quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be somewhere right 
now?&quot;

- - - - -

Chiyo Tsukidate stood in the open doorway, eyes wide, horrified with the 
scene before her. Clinging for dear life to her trusty broom, she sighed 
with dismay as she took in the state of Nagisa and Tamao&#39;s dormitory; 
the unkempt beds, Nagisa&#39;s discarded red gown lying across one of them, 
Tamao&#39;s blue silk dress hanging over the back of the chair. The low 
table they used for late night tea parties was cluttered with knocked 
over tea cups, half eaten cookies and a pot of stone cold tea left 
unfinished in the middle. Towels lay slung across the floor, and Tamao&#39;s 
limited collection of makeup was strewn across the desk. What the girls 
had gotten up to the previous night was beyond her.

And more importantly, they had all that fun without her!

But Chiyo&#39;s train of thought stopped dead in its tracks; that couldn&#39;t 
be right. Given events at the Etoile election, she couldn&#39;t imagine 
either of the upperclassmen she room temp&#39;ed for having had any fun at 
all the previous evening.

Perhaps something awful happened; perhaps they had a row and that was 
why the room was such a mess.

Chiyo&#39;s heart sunk, and she shook her head, tugging at the hem of her 
apron. She didn&#39;t like seeing Nagisa and Tamao fighting; she couldn&#39;t 
bare the sight of Nagisa&#39;s cute face with anything but a smile on it. 
The thought almost brought her to tears.

She sniffed and shuffled her bucket to one side, closing the door behind 
her. Regardless of what had happened or why, she would have to get on or 
she&#39;d miss lunch. And Nagisa was always happy at lunch. She&#39;d hate to 
take that smile away by not having finished the room up for their 
return.

&#39;That&#39;s it!&#39; she thought, and with renewed energy jumped into her work, 
&#39;I&#39;ll make sure they come home to a beautiful room, and then they&#39;ll 
stop fighting and be happy again!&#39;

Beaming with the thought of fixing the world&#39;s problems for the two 
older girls, she hurriedly collected up the tea cups and headed toward 
the bathroom sink to wash them out.

- - - - -

&quot;Good morning President Rokujo.&quot;

Miyuki nodded her head in greeting as she hurried past some 
underclassmen on her way toward the student council rooms in Miator&#39;s 
imposing school building. Face flushed and hair still somewhat damp from 
rushing to get ready, Miyuki was not her usually well presented self 
this morning and the passing girls murmured in low voices as they 
glanced behind them to take a second look. The rumour mill would be rife 
this week.

Miyuki&#39;s footsteps echoed loudly in the corridor, bouncing off the 
hardwood floor in their haste, her pace only becoming more measured as 
she approached the office itself.

Stopping briefly to adjust her uniform and straighten her hair, Miyuki 
gathered herself before opening the double doors to the council chamber.

As she entered, a cold draught hit her and paperwork jumped into the 
air, floating across the wide wooden table that dominated the room 
inside. The circle of red cushioned chairs sat empty, the room&#39;s 
occupants gathered before an open patio door at the other end of the 
room, watching the younger girls playing in the melting snow outside. 
Being the day after the Etoile election, classes were cancelled, and 
besides their various club activities, the girls were free for the day. 
Responding to the flying paper work, the two figures turned to greet 
Miyuki.

&quot;Good morning President Rokujo,&quot; Hitomi offfered. She stepped back from 
the patio door revealing the dark haired Mizhuo behind her. &quot;You&#39;re too 
late.&quot;

&quot;Too late?&quot; Miyuki closed the office doors behind her and the bustling 
patio curtains settled as the icy breeze was blocked. &quot;Where are the 
Etoile?&quot;

Mizuho stooped to resuce the scattered papers from the floor and Hitomi 
pushed the patio door to, retaking her seat at the far end of the table.

&quot;They&#39;ve already left. Shizuma arrived with Amane-san this morning, and 
when you failed to appear, she offered to take them around the Miator 
leg on your behalf.&quot; Hitomi settled into the chair, pushing her hair 
back before returning to a book which rested on the table before her. 
Without looking up, she added, &quot;It made sense. After all, she had to 
show them the green house later anyway.&quot;

Miyuki sighed and leaned on the high backed chair before her.

&quot;Shizuma was here?&quot;

Hitomi finished the sentence she was reading then glanced up from page, 
puzzled by Miyuki&#39;s tone.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t she have been?&quot;

Mizuho stood up with the bundle of retrieved paper work, shuffling the 
sheets into a tidy pile on the table. She continued for her fellow 
council member,

&quot;She is the former-Etoile; she still has some duties to perform.&quot;

Miyuki sensed the same hostility from the pair that she had the previous 
day, although much more guarded this morning.

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect her to come here, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Hitomi looked back at her book.

&quot;Perhaps she takes her responsibilities more seriously than Rokujo-san 
gives her credit for.&quot; A wry smirk crossed Hitomi&#39;s lips, hidden from 
Miyuki by her fallen auburn bob. &quot;After all, she was on time.&quot;

Miyuki flounced as she turned and left, hurrying off to find the new 
Etoile.

- - - - -

Despite the snow and the chill wind outside, the midday sun warmed the 
green house as usual, the pungent scent of the many plants within 
filling the air. Even on the darkest, coldest of days the garden 
reminded Shizuma of summer.

She sat at the high garden table, serving tea for Amane who sat with 
her, and Hikari who had disappeared somewhere amongst the collection of 
flora that filled the vaulted glass chamber. Comfortable in the sun, the 
pair discussed the morning&#39;s tour and the role the new Etoile now found 
themselves expected to fill. Shizuma gently replaced the china tea pot 
and handed Amane her refilled cup. Amane accepted it gratefully and 
gazed around before sipping the hot liquid gingerly.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m the type,&quot; she smiled wearily. &quot;On top of everything 
else, it looks like so much work.&quot;

Shizuma grinned,

&quot;I did warn you.&quot;

The silver-haired sixth grader leaned back in her chair, her fingers 
idly tracing the white lattice work of the wrought iron table. A feeling 
of contentment filled her, and the grin became a fond smile.

&quot;As much of a chore as it becomes with time, I will miss this place.&quot; 
She tipped her head and swirled the lush red tea in its cup. &quot;So many 
memories.&quot;

Amane watched her, offering,

&quot;You&#39;re more than welcome to help when you wish.&quot;

Shizuma smiled back, her green eyes sparkling in the light, &quot;I would 
like that. But please, don&#39;t sacrifice your privacy on my part. There 
are few places the Etoile can go to escape the school&#39;s constant 
attention. This place is a sanctuary at times.&quot;

Amane sighed. The lime light had never appealed, and the year ahead of 
her stretched under the strain of new responsibilities and added 
expectations. But before she could remark as much, Hikari&#39;s delightful 
voice chimed through the green house,

&quot;These are beautiful Shizuma-sama!&quot;

Amane&#39;s heart warmed, and the thought of the yawning term faded quickly.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so formal Hikari, I&#39;ve told you before,&quot; the older girl called 
back.

Hikari&#39;s head popped up from behind a wall of green leaves and 
multi-coloured flowers. She was holding a brown ceramic pot of 
particularly lively orange flowers. Her cheeks were glowing a similar 
colour, a spot of dark earth smeared across one side.

&quot;Yes Shizuma-sama.&quot;

The tiny blonde head disappeared again, carried off by the excitement of 
exploring the astounding array of colours and scents.

Shizuma chuckled.

&quot;You&#39;ll have to watch her Amane; she&#39;ll never attend classes again if 
you leave her alone in here too long.&quot;

Amane smiled, one hand subconsciously moving to touch the soft yellow 
scarf tucked round her uniform collar.

&quot;Helloooo?&quot;

The two girls turned to face the holler. The call came from the green 
house door, and a cold breeze rustled the foliage.

&quot;Come in and shut the door my love,&quot; Shizuma called back, sitting up and 
straining to see the flash of red hair as it worked towards them between 
the rows of plants.

&quot;Nagisa-chan!&quot; Hikari beamed and raced to greet her, the girls colliding 
in an embrace of black and white uniforms as Nagisa reached the others 
at the table. They hugged for a moment, before the younger girl released 
her friend from the tight squeeze.

&quot;Good afternoon Etoile,&quot; Nagisa chimed, grinning as she looked Hikari up 
and down. Nodding politely, she repeated the greeting to Amane.

&quot;Nagisa,&quot; Shizuma purred in her usual husky tone. Nagisa regarded her 
from under her red mop with telling eyes.

&quot;Good afternoon.&quot; She smiled and looked back at the closed green house 
door before hurrying round the table to leap into Shizuma&#39;s lap, 
throwing her arms around her girlfriend&#39;s neck. Hikari blushed and 
looked away as the pair kissed tenderly. Moments passed before Nagisa 
put the older girl down and turned back to face the others. Shizuma 
smiled. It had been a long, long time since she&#39;d been able to act so 
freely without a chorus of gasps accompanying it. Hikari, still red in 
the cheeks, sidled over to the table to sit next to Amane, reaching 
gingerly to hold the long slender fingers resting on the patio table.

Shizuma offered the young Miatorian a sip from her half-drunk cup of 
tea, which Nagisa accepted thirstily.

For a moment, the four sat in silence, enjoying the sun and each other&#39;s 
company, an unspoken understanding passing between them.

Nagisa returned the cup to its china plate, then ran her fingers through 
Shizuma&#39;s long silver hair before straightening the mess she&#39;d made of 
the upperclassman&#39;s collar.

&quot;Did you talk to Miyuki?&quot; she asked, brushing down the green neck tie. 
Shizuma responded flatly,

&quot;No, I couldn&#39;t face her last night and she didn&#39;t show up this 
morning.&quot; The former-Etoile glanced across the table in acknowledgement. 
&quot;Amane-san very kindly let me stay in her room last night, to avoid 
unwanted confrontations.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Nagisa replied quietly. Then her expression picked up again as she 
continued,

&quot;I spoke to Tamao.&quot;

Shizuma looked up at Nagisa.

&quot;You did?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Nagisa replied, &quot;I think she&#39;s okay.&quot;

Hikari&#39;s face brightened, &quot;Nagisa-chan and Tamao-chan are still 
friends?&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s brow furrowed,

&quot;I hope so. She was upset, but... I think she understands.&quot;

Hikari looked relieved.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad Nagisa-chan. I would have missed our tea parties.&quot;

Nagisa grinned.

An idea Shizuma had been toying with earlier sprang back to mind and she 
stroked Nagisa&#39;s auburn locks as she formulated her proposition.

&quot;Perhaps if the Etoile can drag themselves away from their new duties, 
they might join Nagisa and I at my vacation home this weekend...&quot; She 
continued, &quot;...by way of a break from their busy new lives maybe.&quot; She 
looked at the young girl sat on her lap fondly. &quot;I&#39;m sure the Sister 
would permit you both a night&#39;s grace to wind down.&quot;

Amane looked across the table, inwardly pleased by the newly found 
companionship. She looked at Hikari and replied,

&quot;That would be our pleasure I&#39;m sure.&quot;

Hikari nodded eagerly and smiled, but Amane&#39;s face became vexed.

&quot;But I have Star Bride to attend to. And I can&#39;t miss a morning&#39;s 
practice.&quot;

Shizuma laughed and flashed a grin at the blonde Spican sat opposite 
her.

&quot;Hear that Hikari; you&#39;re losing out to a horse.&quot;

Pleasant laughter rippled throughout the green house, and then Shizuma 
returned to Amane,

&quot;Surely that damn animal can survive for a day without you. Aren&#39;t there 
stable hands that can deal with him, or is your school really that 
backwards?&quot;

Hikari was grinning and shot Amane a false look of rejection, her big 
blue eyes a deep ocean of theatrical innocence.

&quot;Amane-senpai...&quot;

She did all but flutter her eyelashes, which made Nagisa giggle to no 
end.

Amane sighed and surrendered.

&quot;I guess so yes.&quot;

Nagisa clapped her hands in delight as Shizuma grinned victoriously.

&quot;Good, then I&#39;ll speak to the Sister and arrange a driver for saturday 
morning. It will be nice to escape the preying eyes for a bit.&quot;

Amane squeezed Hikari&#39;s hand and relaxed back into her chair. Despite 
the morning&#39;s bustle, things had gone well, and Shizuma&#39;s company had 
been nice; the understanding subtext and useful guidance appreciated. It 
seemed she was due to attain more from her new role than Shizuma had 
originally hinted.

- - - - -

Miyuki stood deathly still despite the cold wind taunting her, one hand 
resting on the freezing green house door handle as her black Miator 
uniform blew about her. Willing her hand to move, she struggled 
inwardly, unable to step forward whilst fighting the urge to turn and 
hurry back to the dormitories behind.

Both sides of the battle were locked in stalemate.

She dared to look up through the glass again. They were still there, the 
four of them. Happily gathered around the table chatting.

She was still there.

Miyuki looked back at the floor again, cursing the anxiety that gripped 
her. When did she become so weak?

A moment passed, and then finally her will broke. There was no way she 
could face Shizuma, let alone with Nagisa there too.

Turning, she ran for the shelter of the dormitories ahead of her and 
their secluding solace.

- - - - -

Chiyo was just finishing up as a flustered Tamao burst into the dorm. 
Surprised by the sight of the first year, she paused for a moment in the 
doorway, a flustered look on her face as she took in the scene. Chiyo 
had worked hard all morning; the messy beds, discarded clothes and dirty 
tea set were gone, replaced by the usual pristine cleanliness that she 
was used to. The little first year stood in the corner, broom in one 
hand, bucket in the other, her apron covered in damp washing up stains.

&quot;You&#39;ve tidied up?&quot; Tamao observed flatly.

&quot;Yes Tamao-sama,&quot; Chiyo replied in a tiny voice, unsure if the 
distressed fourth year was going to give her praise or shout at her. She 
looked up at Tamao and weakly offered,

&quot;Is Tamao-chan okay?&quot;

In an explosion of waving arms and fuming gestures, Tamao stomped back 
and forth across the room, ranting loudly as she did,

&quot;I wish everyone would stop asking me that! All day it&#39;s been, &#39;Are you 
okay Tamao-chan?&#39; &#39;Can I help Tamao-chan?&#39; &#39;I feel so sorry for you 
Tamao-chan.&#39; Wasn&#39;t it so rude of Shizuma to run off with Nagisa the way 
she did, ruining the Etoile election for you! Like anyone knows anything 
about it anyway!&quot;

She flopped onto her bed, throwing her arms wide.

&quot;I wish they&#39;d all just leave me alone.&quot;

Staring at the ceiling, she lay there in protest having expunged her 
demons to a satisfying degree.

Chiyo didn&#39;t know whether to stay silent or risk provoking another 
volley whilst bidding her leave. She put the bucket down, fiddled with 
her apron and opted for the former.

Tamao sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s all Miyuki&#39;s fault. I never should have accepted her offer, and 
then none of this could have happened.&quot;

Chiyo shuffled her feet a little, and Tamao looked up, realizing she&#39;d 
made the younger girl feel awkward. She propped herself up with her 
elbows and apologised to Chiyo,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just stressed Chiyo-chan. You&#39;ve done really well with 
the room.&quot;

Chiyo beamed.

&quot;Thank you Tamao-sama.&quot;

Chiyo came over to the bed and sat beside the fourth year.

&quot;Does Tamao think Nagisa-onee-sama will be happy to?&quot;

&quot;I would imagine so yes.&quot; Tamao replied. &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll thank you too 
when she sees you.&quot; Then dismay washed over her as she remembered a 
favour she&#39;d agreed to earlier. Sitting up she brushed her messy fringe 
from her eyes and asked,

&quot;Does Chiyo-chan want to go to a tea party tonight? I have some special 
cakes that were meant for yesterday; they need eating very soon.&quot;

Chiyo smiled.

&quot;I would love to Tamao-sama. Who is going?&quot;

Tamao gestured widely, her sincerity not entirely its usual self.

&quot;Everyone of course. Yaya-chan is holding it in her room. Tsusbomi, 
Kagome, Remon, Kizuna, even Hikari will be there if she can get away!&quot;

Chiyo noted the exception and bleakly asked,

&quot;Is Nagisa-onee-sama not coming too?&quot;

Tamao&#39;s face sunk and she ran her hand over the bed cover, tracing the 
embodied pattern.

&quot;Perhaps.&quot;

Chiyo smiled and gratefully accepted the offer,

&quot;Chiyo would love to come yes. It will be just like usual!&quot;

Tamao sighed and nodded,

&quot;Just like usual.&quot;

- - - - -

The atmosphere in the dining room that evening was surreal. For the 
first time since their successful election, the new Etoile gave grace 
before the meal. With everyone seated, Amane&#39;s commanding elegance 
silenced the room before Hikari spoke the words of the Lord&#39;s Prayer, 
her beautiful voice enchanting all within. The adoring eyes of the 
gathered students followed the pair wherever they went, the constant 
attention almost as stifling as the raised temperature. Murmurs and 
chatter layered over each other as the girls ate, glances and whispers 
passing up and down the surrounding tables.

Controversially, the Etoile sat at the same table as Nagisa and Shizuma, 
the other in-vogue couple attracting almost as much attention as the 
election winners. Jealous eyes looked Nagisa up and down as the four 
chatted over their meal. Tamao, Chiyo, and the rest of the usual 
suspects were dispersed elsewhere as the traditional school-by-school 
seating dictated. The notable exception being Miyuki, whose absence went 
almost unnoticed by some, marked by others.

Chiyo looked disappointed as she munched away beside Tamao,

&quot;Why isn&#39;t Nagisa-onee-sama eating with us?&quot;

Tamao failed to return a reply, instead concentrating on her own food 
and avoiding looking up from the plate. She was sullen, something 
obviously playing on her mind.

Chikaru approached the head table where the Etoile sat, bidding the four 
girls a good evening.

&quot;Hikari-chan gave the evening prayer in excellent fashion,&quot; she offered. 
Hikari thanked her, trying not to let her embarrassment show having 
received a long lecture from Shizuma about relaxing in public. Instead 
she toyed with the ruby Etoile pendant that hung from her neck, trying 
to look settled and attentive.

Chikaru smiled.

&quot;You both look radiant as Etoile, although I say that with no ill 
meaning to Shizuma-sama.&quot;

Shizuma nodded, indicating none was taken.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if we should expect you at dinner Shizuma, although it&#39;s 
very nice to see you here.&quot; Chikaru was playing detective as usual.

Shizuma smiled, and shrugged.

&quot;It would be unfair not to offer my support to the new Etoile. After 
all, few understand their new burdens as well I do.&quot;

Chikaru nodded. She looked across at Nagisa, the red head trying to 
avoid the Lulim President&#39;s prying gaze. Instead she sat back in her 
chair, head down, chasing crumbs around her plate with a fork.

&quot;And you look like you&#39;re practically glowing tonight Nagisa.&quot;

Nagisa glanced upward, surprisingly off-cuff in her response.

&quot;It&#39;s amazing what a good night&#39;s beauty sleep can do.&quot;

Chikaru smiled, the reply interestingly uncharacteristic. There was an 
air of confidence about the auburn haired upperclassman that hadn&#39;t been 
there days before. The difference was entertainingly distracting.

&quot;Has anyone seen President Miyuki this evening?&quot; Chikaru asked, noting a 
change on Shizuma&#39;s face as the name was mentioned. Amane replied 
politely on everyone&#39;s behalf,

&quot;I don&#39;t think any of us have seen her since yesterday Chikaru-san.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I hope she&#39;s not unwell,&quot; Chikaru replied, &quot;I would hate to see our 
first Council meeting cancelled. I look forward to helping the new 
Etoile plan the end of year celebrations.&quot;

Tired of the fishing trip, Shizuma cut in,

&quot;I&#39;m sure Hitomi or Mizuho can provide an excellent stand-in if 
necessary. There&#39;s no need to cancel anything on Miyuki&#39;s behalf.&quot; With 
that she excused herself and Nagisa, wishing everyone a pleasant 
evening, the usual hoard of eyes watching them leave.

It was late by the time the tea-party came to a close. With the cakes 
gone, the tea pot empty and heavy eyelids hinting that it was time the 
girls went to sleep, Kizuna, Remon and Kagome bid the others fair well, 
then tip-toed out into the hallway. Kagome waved everyone goodbye with 
Percival&#39;s paw and the three headed back to their appropriate dorms, 
commenting in dismay that neither Hikari nor Nagisa had managed to 
attend. As they made their made through the dark corridors, their 
whispered remarks also noted how off sorts Tamao had been, and how much 
happier Yaya seemed to be lately.

After watching the three Lulim girls disappear into the darkness, Yaya 
tipped the dormitory door closed quietly and slipped into bed beside 
Tsubomi, wriggling under the covers until she was warm again. Tsubomi, 
Chiyo, and Tamao had opted to stay in Yaya&#39;s room that night, the four 
girls splitting between the two beds, Tsubomi loudly nominating herself 
to share with Yaya. After all, it was far too cold outside to be 
traipsing around in the freezing hallways like the air-headed Lilum 
contingent. Mumbled blessings of a good night&#39;s sleep did the rounds 
before Yaya killed the desk lamp and the room plunged into darkness.

Curled up behind Chiyo, Tamao lay still, listening to muffled giggles 
and the odd squeak of bed springs from the other side of the room. After 
a while, the other two fell silent, and Tamao was left to her thoughts, 
hugging the first year in front of her for warmth as Chiyo snoozed 
peacefully.

Waiting until she was certain she was the only one awake, she finally 
let herself relax, tears slowly welling in the corner of her eyes.

&quot;Where are we going Nagisa?&quot; Shizuma asked as the excitable fourth 
grader dragged her by the hand through the pitch black dormitory 
corridors. In the poor light and Nagisa&#39;s apparent haste, the 
former-Etoile had become lost several turns previously.

&quot;You&#39;ll see, now shush before you wake the entire floor up,&quot; Nagisa 
whispered back.

The girls turned another corner and Nagisa slowed as she reached one of 
the tall wooden doors.

&quot;Isn&#39;t this is your room?&quot; Shizuma asked as their location dawned on 
her. Nagisa had led her in almost a complete circle from the lower 
lounge.

&quot;Of course it is,&quot; Nagisa replied, as she unlocked the door and pulled 
Shizuma into the black room beyond, shutting it quietly behind them.

Shizuma waited in the darkness as her eyes adjusted.

&quot;What about Tamao?&quot; she asked, straining to see where Nagisa had gone.

&quot;She&#39;s not here,&quot; Nagisa replied from somewhere at the back of the room, 
the sound of the younger girl fumbling about in a draw following. &quot;I 
told her you weren&#39;t yet speaking to Miyuki at lunch and she offered to 
stay with Yaya tonight after a tea party.&quot;

More fumbling commenced, followed by,

&quot;Aha!&quot;

There was the sound of a match being struck, after which a small light 
in the back of the room fizzled to life. Gingerly, Nagisa lit several 
candles that had been waiting on her desk, a warm rich glow spreading 
throughout the room.

&quot;And she was okay with that?&quot; Shizuma asked quizzically.

&quot;She seemed to be,&quot; Nagisa responded as she put the match out, turning 
to the older girl. &quot;Besides, the idea of another night in that freezing 
attic really didn&#39;t appeal. I figured we could at least manage a bed 
this time.&quot;

Shizuma laughed softly, &quot;That I can understand.&quot;

The pair looked at each other for a moment, neither sure what to say. In 
the back of her mind, Shizuma was left uncomfortable with Tamao&#39;s 
apparent gesture. Nagisa on the other hand was trying to bolster her 
newly found confidence. Shizuma noted the look on her face and grinned, 
the dominance between them returning to its rightful owner.

&quot;Not quite there yet are you my love.&quot;

Nagisa blushed in self-awareness, looking away from Shizuma&#39;s burning 
emerald gaze.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean,&quot; she said, an over the top tone attempting 
to cover her embarrassment. She shuffled uncomfortably, not knowing how 
to proceed but desperately wanting to all the same.

Shizuma swept toward the younger girl and stroked Nagisa&#39;s arm with a 
gentle touch. She looked down at the fourth grader with increasingly 
playful eyes.

&quot;It&#39;ll come in time.&quot; She said, slowly circling the red head, a hungry 
gaze taking in every inch of the young woman before her.

Nagisa felt goose bumps rise on her skin as the former-Etoile prowled 
behind her. Arousal washed over her in waves as her pupils dilated 
further in the candle light.

&quot;Something else for you to teach me I guess.&quot;

Shizuma purred and slowly encircled the fourth grader&#39;s waist, her long 
fingers smoothing the black fabric of Nagisa&#39;s uniform against her skin. 
Nagisa continued,

&quot;As long as it doesn&#39;t involve being thrown into another swimming pool, 
I guess I&#39;m easy.&quot;

Shizuma grinned, letting her fingers glide over Nagisa&#39;s stomach and 
down towards her hem line.

Nagisa tipped her head back, resting it on Shizuma&#39;s shoulder, fragrant 
silver hair enveloping her face. Closing her eyes, she lost herself in 
the sensation of Shizuma&#39;s slender fingers moving across her body.

They stood there for a moment, Shizuma manipulating the fourth year like 
a child&#39;s toy.

Frustration building, Nagisa tugged at the clasps on the back of her 
dress, pulling them free one by one. Letting the effort show in her 
voice, she continued,

&quot;Though if sensei doesn&#39;t mind, the finer points can wait until another 
evening. For tonight, this will have to do,&quot; and with that she pulled 
the last clasp free, her dress falling to the ground about her with a 
soft swish.

Shizuma stepped backward, pacing around the flushed form in front of 
her, taking in the sight of the semi-naked red head.

&quot;That would be a great place to start yes.&quot;

Giggling, and with an effortless shove, she pushed Nagisa backwards onto 
the bed behind her, a playful squeal audible as the former-Etoile 
followed.

- - - - -

Miyuki sat in the darkness, her crumpled uniform gathered about her as 
she leant against the cold plaster of the dormitory wall. A picture of 
the desperately lonely Shizuma she had scorned so many times in the 
past, the student council President sat on her bed in the unlit 
dormitory, eyes gazing in unfocused dismay, legs curled up underneath 
her. The blank look on her face betrayed the hollow feeling inside her, 
and she pondered the true depth of her sorrow, wondering just when her 
friendship with Shizuma had become something so much painfully more. 
When and why had she crossed the line that had led to this agony, and 
how had she missed it coming? She tipped her head back against the wall, 
the cool surface chilling against her skin, black hair falling across 
her face.

Perhaps she hadn&#39;t missed it at all. Perhaps she&#39;d just been living in 
the constant hope of recognition, waiting for her turn to come around.

Waiting to be good enough again.

But the reasoning was irrelevant regardless, since the rationale 
wouldn&#39;t take the pain away, and with grim determination she went back 
to her dutiful task.

Staring back at the door, she waited with gut-wrenching longing for 
sound from the neighbouring Dormitory, and the knowledge that Shizuma 
had come home.
