<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>With the chamber beginning to empty out and Miyuki distracted by Tamao 
as they discussed plans for the Cathedral announcement, Shizuma took the 
opportunity to sidle up next to Nagisa.

The red head stood next to the table, one hand resting on the wooden 
surface to prop herself up. The fourth year was completely shattered and 
still reeling a little from the evening&#39;s turn of events. One eye on the 
Miatorian council President, Shizuma leaned close to Nagisa&#39;s ear and 
whispered, &quot;Congratulations, I think.&quot;

Nagisa turned and smiled wryly. Catching the former-Etoile&#39;s watchful 
gaze, she glanced briefly across the room at Miyuki&#39;s turned back before 
concentrating her brown eyes on Shizuma.

&quot;I certainly didn&#39;t expect this.&quot;

Shizuma nodded,

&quot;An eventful day wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot; She smiled, and then added more 
seriously, &quot;I must find Amane some time soon; I&#39;m worried about her.&quot;

Nagisa nodded in agreement, sighing softly. Shizuma wasn&#39;t exaggerating, 
the day had definitely carried a full itinerary, and the younger 
Miatorian was ready to drop.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I think Miyuki is coming to get us in the morning and 
she might have people with her,&quot; Nagisa explained, then adding in a low 
voice she said, &quot;I should sleep in my own room tonight or it will raise 
too many awkward questions in the morning.&quot;

Shizuma nodded and turned from watching Miyuki, looking directly into 
Nagisa&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You&#39;ll be okay with Tamao?&quot; she asked, concern undercutting her voice.

Nagisa&#39;s eyes lit up and she smiled back, her hand reaching for 
Shizuma&#39;s beside her, hidden from the others in the room by the folds of 
her dress and the sixth year&#39;s long overcoat. She squeezed the hand 
lovingly, pressing Shizuma&#39;s fingers against the smooth platinum band on 
the fourth year&#39;s engagement finger.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine now, Shizuma.&quot;

With that, Nagisa let the hand go, stepping back to create a more formal 
looking space between them.

Shizuma lowered her gaze, a warm smile on her lips as she closed her 
left hand tightly behind her, feeling the matching ring she wore between 
her fingers. As she did, Miyuki turned, walking over to the pair with 
Tamao following behind her.

The school council President regarded Shizuma with cold eyes, her tone 
curt,

&quot;I trust these arrangements are manageable for you Shizuma?&quot;

The former-Etoile looked up, her emerald gaze falling on her former room 
mate, replying in a measured voice,

&quot;Perfectly Miyuki. I was just about to ask how you wanted me to 
proceed.&quot;

The dark haired girl gazed at the table for a second, her eyes glazing 
over in thought, before replying,

&quot;Until we allocate duties tomorrow evening, I think the most useful 
thing you can do would be to attend the Green House. Amane seems to have 
abandoned it and we need the flowers for the Ball.&quot;

Shizuma nodded in false respect, continuing,

&quot;If there&#39;s nothing more you need of me tonight I would like to retire, 
we&#39;ve had a long day,&quot; with which she shot Nagisa a telling glance. The 
fourth year looked away, trying to conceal the smile that spread across 
her lips.

Miyuki caught the exchange however, and a look of distain crossed her 
face.

&quot;No, that will be all Shizuma,&quot; she stated flatly.

&quot;Then I wish you all a pleasant evening, and offer my congratulations to 
the new Etoile,&quot; Shizuma replied.

With a mock bow, the silver haired girl turned and left, winking with a 
grin as she brushed past Nagisa on her way to the door.

Regaining her composure, Nagisa turned to face Miyuki and Tamao.

&quot;So unexpected isn&#39;t it Nagisa-chan?&quot; Tamao asked, her blue eyes 
swimming in the light.

Nagisa pondered her dark haired room mate; the conversation in their 
dormitory seemingly a world away, the unwanted attentions of Tamao and 
the politics of school life paling in comparison to the day she&#39;d had 
and the events at the bungalow and in the shopping parade. She smiled 
back politely,

&quot;Yes it is Tamao-chan, although I do hope Amane-sama is okay,&quot; she said, 
her brown eyes falling directly on Miyuki as she finished her sentence, 
a poignant look behind them.

Miyuki raised an eyebrow at the sentiment, not expecting the gutsy 
bravado in Nagisa&#39;s tone.

Grinning oddly, the red head grasped for Tamao&#39;s hand, and she said in 
an overly excited tone,

&quot;We should hurry back to our room and plan what to wear for the 
announcement!&quot;

Tamao nodded enthusiastically with a smile before Nagisa turned back to 
Miyuki,

&quot;Unless there&#39;s anything else Miyuki-san wants from us tonight?&quot;

The sixth year shook her head, uncomfortable with Nagisa&#39;s strange 
strength of character and unwilling to spar for dominancy on uncertain 
terms. The red head was suddenly very feisty around her, and Miyuki 
would rather know where the newly found confidence was coming from 
before moving to stamp it down.

Instead, she simply bade the girls a good night, adding,

&quot;Congratulations to the pair of you. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s wonderful to 
see Miator retain the Etoile for another year?&quot;

Pulling Tamao toward the door, Nagisa broke into a false smile as she 
replied,

&quot;Yes, it fills my heart with joy Rokujo-san.&quot;

Miyuki watched with wry curiosity as the two girls left the room hand in 
hand, Nagisa practically dragging her room mate along.

- - - - -

&quot;Shizuma?&quot; a quiet voice called from the shadows.

The silver haired Miatorian stood before her Dormitory door, just about 
to turn the handle as she heard the low voice behind her. Peering into 
the darkness she asked,

&quot;Amane?&quot;

The Spican stepped forward into the light, Shizuma shocked as she took 
in the pale face streaked with tear stains and the tall girl&#39;s 
dishevelled hair and uniform. The fifth year was in a state, and Shizuma 
hurriedly beckoned her through the door and into her room.

Amane stood facing the window quietly as Shizuma closed the door and 
locked it behind her. Reaching for the kettle she went to the bathroom 
to fill it with fresh water, before returning it to the plastic base to 
boil. Standing behind the fifth year, she rested a hand gently on the 
Spican&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Amane?&quot; she repeated.

The Spican hung her head before turning slowly to meet the emerald gaze,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Shizuma, I didn&#39;t know who else to turn to.&quot;

She raised a hand to her face to wipe her cheeks, adding,

&quot;I&#39;m a mess.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s expression took a sympathetic tone,

&quot;I was going to come and find you tomorrow; we&#39;ve been worried.&quot;

Amane smiled weakly, and patted the hand on her shoulder,

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

Shizuma bid the younger girl to sit, and Amane perched on the end of the 
former-Etoile&#39;s bed while Shizuma prepared a pot for tea. Whilst waiting 
for the kettle, she shed her overcoat, hanging it on a peg by the 
dormitory door.

&quot;We&#39;d have come sooner but we were off premises this afternoon. I wasn&#39;t 
sure if you&#39;d want some space for a while either. You&#39;ve not been in the 
Green House.&quot;

Amane shook her head gently, letting her shoes slip off before curling 
her knees up underneath her on the bed.

&quot;I&#39;ve been riding a lot, trying to take my mind off things.&quot;

Shizuma unclipped her hair band, taking a brush from her desk before 
tipping her head to one side and settling out her long silver locks with 
wide brush strokes. She looked up at Amane,

&quot;I heard you&#39;d turned the Etoile necklace in. They decided to appoint 
Tamao and Nagisa tonight.&quot;

Amane looked up from the bed, her face riddled with surprise,

&quot;They did?&quot; She sighed, &quot;That was Miyuki&#39;s doing no doubt.&quot;

Shizuma righted herself, chucking the brush at Amane before running her 
fingers through her hair to shake the lose strands out.

&quot;No doubt.&quot;

Amane ran the brush through her own hair, before replying in a sad 
voice,

&quot;Not only have I messed up Hikari&#39;s life, now I&#39;ve paved the way for 
Miyuki to ruin yours.&quot;

Shizuma scowled,

&quot;Shush Amane. If it wasn&#39;t this, Miyuki would&#39;ve come up with something 
else,&quot; then with a grin she added, &quot;besides, we&#39;ll cope just fine.&quot;

The telling sparkle in Shizuma&#39;s eyes caught Amane&#39;s attention, and the 
fifth year paused her brushing, frowning in curiosity.

&quot;What aren&#39;t you telling me Shizuma?&quot; she asked with a wry look.

The Miatorian smiled back, but replied,

&quot;Something for another day Amane; when we&#39;ve got you back on your feet. 
Don&#39;t worry yourself about Nagisa and I, we&#39;ll deal with Miyuki.&quot;

Amane looked puzzled, but her heavy heart had left her too exhausted to 
push the subject and instead she went back to brushing out her dark bob.

&quot;I&#39;m struggling Shizuma; I&#39;ve never felt like this.&quot;

The kettle clicked loudly, and Shizuma stooped to attend it.

&quot;Unfortunately I can imagine exactly how you&#39;re feeling right now. It&#39;s 
not a pleasant place to be.&quot;

Amane put the brush on the side before leaning back against the wall,

&quot;It&#39;s not as though I even had the chance to say goodbye, or to ask her 
what actually happened.&quot;

She growled in frustration,

&quot;I need to talk to her Shizuma; I&#39;m going crazy not knowing. It&#39;s like 
there&#39;s a part of me missing and I have no way of finding it again.&quot;

Shizuma frowned as she poured the tea, her mind turning over ideas and 
possibilities.

&quot;You don&#39;t have any contact numbers for her?&quot;

Amane shook her head in dismay,

&quot;She phoned the stables this morning but rang off without saying 
anything.&quot;

She felt the pain twist in her stomach and she bit her lip as she fought 
back a wave of tears.

&quot;She sounded so sad Shizuma.&quot;

The former-Etoile looked up in dismay, unsure how to deal with Amane in 
this state; the Spican had always been so reserved in the past. The 
emotional mess sat on the bed in front of her was a stark contrast to 
the norm.

Passing the fifth year a steaming cup of red tea, Shizuma offered,

&quot;There is one possibility I guess. If I can get into Mizue&#39;s office I 
could pull Hikari&#39;s number from the school files. The council has me 
running around after the new Etoile for a while, I&#39;m sure I can find an 
excuse to be in there.&quot;

Amane sipped the tea gingerly,

&quot;But I have no idea what I&#39;d say to her even if she did pick the phone 
up Shizuma. For all I know she&#39;ll just hang up on me again.&quot;

She sighed heavily,

&quot;I need to do this face to face.&quot;

Shizuma nodded,

&quot;I could pull her address?&quot;

Amane raised a hand in defeat,

&quot;But I wouldn&#39;t be able to get there anyway, and everyone&#39;s watching me 
at the moment, I wouldn&#39;t be able to leave the grounds without someone 
knowing.&quot;

Shizuma frowned, then with a thought she added,

&quot;I have a friend that might help, and I can arrange for a driver to take 
you. I just need an excuse to get you off site.&quot;

Amane looked up, puzzled,

&quot;A friend? What have you got in mind?&quot;

Shizuma smiled knowingly.

&quot;Let me worry about the how, you concentrate on what you&#39;ll say to 
Hikari if we get you there.&quot;

Amane looked at the former-Etoile fondly,

&quot;You&#39;d do that for me?&quot;

Shizuma smiled back,

&quot;What are friends for?&quot;

The Spican tipped her head back against the wall, regarding Shizuma with 
a weary sigh of relief,

&quot;Thank you Shizuma.&quot;

The Miatorian swirled her cup, replying,

&quot;Finish up your tea and I&#39;ll walk you back to your room.&quot;

- - - - -

With Miyuki out of sight, Nagisa had dropped the false pretence 
immediately and let Tamao&#39;s hand go, heading back to their room with a 
brisk stride, eager to get her head down for the night. Tamao picked up 
on the change in mood, and trotted alongside the red head, mulling over 
whether or not she should ask what was wrong.

She opted for small talk,

&quot;Did Nagisa-chan have a nice afternoon? You were both off premises after 
lessons weren&#39;t you?&quot;

Nagisa replied flatly,

&quot;We went to visit some family yes,&quot; she muttered, remaining 
intentionally vague.

&quot;It went well I hope?&quot; Tamao asked, trying to provoke some conversation.

Nagisa sighed and nodded,

&quot;You could say that yes. We had a busy day; I didn&#39;t need to come back 
to this.&quot;

Tamao replied without thinking,

&quot;Isn&#39;t Nagisa-chan happy to become Etoile?&quot;

Nagisa stopped dead in her tracks, turning to face her room mate with a 
scowl. The afternoon&#39;s happy distractions fell away and in a low but 
sharp tone she gave Tamao some free clarity,

&quot;Obviously I&#39;m thrilled with the idea Tamao; after all, I&#39;ve always 
wanted Miyuki breathing down my neck while she tries to enact her pretty 
revenge on my girlfriend.&quot;

She glared at Tamao with angry brown eyes,

&quot;What else did you think this was about?&quot;

Tamao dropped her gaze, unsure how to respond and surprised by Nagisa&#39;s 
uncharacteristic hostility. She mumbled quietly,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Nagisa-chan, I hadn&#39;t looked at it that way.&quot;

Nagisa scowled, rolling her eyes and snapping as she continued walking,

&quot;No, I don&#39;t suppose you did.&quot;

Tamao watched for a moment as Nagisa strode off, her face sullen, before 
hurrying to catch up.

As the girls reached their Dormitory they passed Chihaya and Mizushima 
in the corridor, their neighbours parting for the fuming red head as she 
barged past. They traded glances as Nagisa disappeared into the 
Dormitory she shared with Tamao, slamming the door behind her. A few 
steps behind, Tamao shrugged meekly at the girls before following her 
room mate inside.

&quot;Nagisa-chan?&quot; she said, closing the door quietly behind her.

Nagisa had disappeared into the bathroom briefly, before returning with 
a glass of water in hand. She stood regarding the other fourth year with 
an agitated look as she downed the drink.

Tamao gazed back, waiting hesitantly for a response.

Setting the empty glass on her desk, Nagisa removed her woollen wrap, 
putting it on a hanger in her wardrobe. She kicked off her shoes, 
pushing them under her bed before turning to stare directly at Tamao. 
She unzipped her dress, letting it drop to the floor at her feet, a 
challenging look in her eyes that held Tamao&#39;s gaze as the red head 
unclipped her bra and slipped it off. Throwing the discarded underwear 
onto the end of her bed, she took her pastel night shirt from atop the 
pillow next to her.

Tamao blushed, feeling awkward at Nagisa&#39;s defiant nudity, unsure where 
to look given the other girl&#39;s aggressive air.

Nagisa continued to stare at her room mate as she buttoned the night 
shirt before slipping on her pyjama bottoms. She then turned to brush 
her hair as she regarded herself in the mirror.

Tamao remained silent, still unsure how to react.

After a moment, Nagisa&#39;s temper snapped, and she turned back to the dark 
haired girl watching her,

&quot;I bet you&#39;re loving this aren&#39;t you Etoile nonsense aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Tamao baulked,

&quot;Nagisa-chan?&quot;

The red head scowled, throwing her brush into the corner of the room 
with a loud clatter,

&quot;And what was that about the other day in front of the mirror? Why did 
you touch me like that Tamao? Why, when you know I&#39;m with Shizuma? 
You&#39;re supposed to be my friend.&quot;

Tamao flinched at the other girl&#39;s words and their volume, aware that 
their neighbours were still chatting in the corridor outside,

&quot;Nagisa...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t Nagisa me,&quot; the red head snapped, &quot;I&#39;m done with the games Tamao. 
It stops, now.&quot;

The dark haired girl looked back, stunned,

&quot;But I...&quot;

&quot;But nothing. I&#39;m with Shizuma. End of story. No more teasing, no more 
flirting, no more tape measures and no more invading my personal space.&quot;

Tamao lowered her eyes, staring at the floor.

Nagisa sighed, looking at the evasive figure in front of her.

&quot;I&#39;m tired of Miyuki&#39;s meddling Tamao. I&#39;m tired of her using our 
friendship against Shizuma,&quot; and she gestured in annoyance as she 
finished, &quot;and I&#39;m tired of you playing straight into her hands. I 
didn&#39;t want any of this and I don&#39;t want the Etoile either. I want to be 
left in peace with my girlfriend.&quot;

Tamao stood silent in the corner, waiting for Nagisa to finish. As she 
looked up, she caught the flash of something in Nagisa&#39;s left hand, and 
her heart jumped in recognition. Was that what she thought it was?

Nagisa missed the change on Tamao&#39;s face, and deciding she was venting 
at deaf ears, Nagisa scowled again and climbed into bed.

&quot;If you&#39;re going to be up long can you use your desk lamp; I need some 
sleep,&quot; she said.

And with that, Nagisa rolled over, facing the wall, pulling her covers 
up over her shoulder.

- - - - -

The Dormitory was dominated by an uncomfortable silence the following 
morning, and Tamao shuffled about quietly as the girls got ready for 
breakfast. Nagisa&#39;s mood didn&#39;t appear to have improved, and the dark 
haired fourth year did her best to stay out of the way, feeling an 
unpleasant cocktail of guilt and rejection. Nagisa&#39;s outburst had left 
her panicked, fearing the pair had lost something special and that 
Tamao&#39;s actions had done their friendship permanent damage, the girls 
having never argued so openly before.

They went about their business with only clipped words passing between 
them, Nagisa busy adjusting her Etoile gown before changing back into 
her uniform to attend the breakfast hall. Meanwhile, Tamao watched in 
glances from her position sat on her bed, pretending to finish up one of 
the many failed attempts from her unproductive club activities the 
previous day, doing her best not to make the observations obvious as she 
examined the ring on Nagisa&#39;s engagement finger. Her mind played over 
its source, and she wondered if Nagisa had been to see her parents while 
they were off premises.

It would certainly need to be something grave to explain why the two 
girls had been able to leave Astrea during school hours without ending 
up in the Sister&#39;s office afterward. Being left out of the loop over 
such serious matters hardly presented an optimistic outlook for their 
friendship either.

Nagisa finished up with her gown and returned it to her wardrobe before 
slipping into her black Miatorian dress, fastening the clips at the back 
one by one. She straightened her uniform out as she looked at herself in 
the mirror.

Tamao took a deep breath, intending to break the ice, but Nagisa cut in 
before her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for yelling at you yesterday Tamao-chan,&quot; she said, her voice 
level, deep brown eyes not leaving the mirror as she tied her hair back,

&quot;But the Etoile really isn&#39;t something I want, and the way Tamao-chan 
was talking the other day made me uncomfortable.&quot;

Turning, she looked at her room mate directly, her tone conciliatory.

&quot;I love you dearly Tamao-chan, I do. You&#39;re my closet friend...&quot;

She stopped, considering those first words, feeling strange having used 
that particular expression in reference to anyone other than Shizuma. 
Sighing, she continued,

&quot;But we&#39;re friends Tamao; it&#39;s not the same with Shizuma. And I can&#39;t 
cope with the comments anymore, I need my space.&quot;

Tamao looked away and nodded with a guilty sigh. She&#39;d known she had 
overstepped the mark the moment she&#39;d stepped away from behind Nagisa&#39;s 
desk chair. It&#39;d all happened so quickly though, she&#39;d just been swept 
up in the moment. The last thing she&#39;d wanted to do was threaten their 
friendship.

The past week had been so incredibly awkward; she&#39;d done her best at 
playing the understanding friend, allowing the couple their space, doing 
what she could to bury her own feelings and to hide the rejection and 
hurt. But that morning in the Dormitory, when she&#39;d had to bolt for the 
shower as Chihaya&#39;s hollering had woken the sleeping sixth year as she 
lay naked beside the red head, Tamao had found her foundations so 
utterly rocked. Quietly she&#39;d struggled with the physical aspect of what 
she&#39;d seen for days, unsure of how she&#39;d actually feel about being with 
another girl like that, suddenly realising that this is what it meant to 
further nature the feelings she&#39;d grown up with, to finally seeing where 
it truly led.

She&#39;d always known she was different, the way the others girls avoided 
her in the underclassman years had made that obvious enough. But as 
she&#39;d stood there, playing with Nagisa&#39;s hair, feeling the warmth 
against her fingers, the sweet smell of Nagisa&#39;s perfume enveloping her 
and the luscious sensation of watching the red head react to her 
actions, she&#39;d felt something so very different. It was like taking 
sweeties from the jar you were told never to touch, knowing it was so 
very wrong and relishing every second of the act. Now with her mind very 
much made up about what she wanted, here she was, petrified she&#39;d 
destroyed the friendship that had brought her to understanding it all.

This wasn&#39;t happening the way it was supposed to.

Yet, nagging at the back of her mind was another thought, one she&#39;d 
tried and failed repeatedly to silence.

Why was Nagisa&#39;s reaction so defensive? Why was Tamao&#39;s more serious 
tone so apparently invasive? And why had Nagisa reacted at all? Surely 
if her room mate was a little more secure in her feelings for Shizuma, 
then perhaps Tamao&#39;s advances wouldn&#39;t have been quite so unsettling...

Tamao frowned inwardly at the prospect.

Was there still hope?

Pushing the thought from her mind again, she replied by changing the 
subject,

&quot;Is Nagisa-chan not planning to explain her new ring?&quot;

Nagisa stopped brushing her hair out, and slowly lowered her left hand 
to her side. For a moment, she wondered how to respond.

Tamao couldn&#39;t wait for the reply, and pressed eagerly,

&quot;Have Nagisa-chan&#39;s parents found her a husband? Is that where you were 
yesterday?&quot;

Nagisa frowned, bemused by the thought. As she opened her mouth to 
reply, Tamao continued,

&quot;Is that why you were so moody last night Nagisa-chan?&quot;

Tamao sat forward on her bed, peering with curiosity in her eyes,

&quot;Surely that will make things awkward for you and Shizuma?&quot; She asked,

&quot;Did your parents meet Shizuma? What did you tell them about her?&quot;

Nagisa sighed, unsure of what to divulge or where to start. The young 
couple had planned to discuss it after returning to the Dormitories, but 
given the unexpected welcome at the school gate, the conversation hadn&#39;t 
occurred. How should she reply?

To her relief, there was a sharp rap of knuckles against wood, 
postponing her answer for her.

Miyuki cracked the door open, staring expectantly at the two girls.

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; she asked.

Tamao sighed to herself at the distraction, still craning for Nagisa&#39;s 
response, but the sixth year beckoned them from the room with a click of 
her fingers. The school council President had an air of purpose and 
Tamao followed her direction promptly, a downbeat Nagisa trailing 
behind.

Without looking over her shoulder, Miyuki addressed the two girls in a 
formal tone.

&quot;Remain silent until Sister Mizue has made the announcement at 
breakfast, after which you&#39;re free to discuss matters with the other 
students. Bear in mind however that you won&#39;t be officially recognized 
until the after the Ceremony itself is completed.&quot;

And with that she started off toward the dining hall, the two fourth 
years following behind.

- - - - -

The dining hall was silent apart from Sister Mizue&#39;s commanding voice, 
the collected girls hanging on each word as the Sister made an initial 
announcement to the assembled students.

Tamao and Nagisa stood behind the grey haired woman at the front of the 
room, the three school Council Presidents off to one side. Several 
members of school staff were also present, watching from positions 
perched at the dining hall doorway before planning to return to their 
faculties ahead of the day&#39;s lessons.

The Dormitory students hadn&#39;t been expecting the announcement at all, 
and when the group of upperclassman and staff figure heads had started 
gathering, rumours raced along the long tables as the girls speculated 
as to the occasion.

It was only when Miyuki had appeared with Tamao and Nagisa in tow that 
the word Etoile had started flying round, and as the girls were made to 
wait for the Sister to arrive, excitement mounted as the tension rose.

Then as the Sister had swept into the room, the tables had fallen silent 
and she&#39;d begun her speech. Moments later, having explained away 
Hikari&#39;s absence under the premise of an unexpected illness and having 
praised Amane for stepping aside, maturely acknowledging her inability 
to cope alone, the Sister was busy wrapping things up.

&quot;And so, in light of Konohana-san&#39;s departure, and with the three 
schools gathered at the Cathedral this afternoon, Astrea will crown 
Miator&#39;s Aoi-san and Suzumi-san as Etoile for the remainder of this term 
and for the immediate future.&quot;

A hushed ripple passed across the tables, before a particularly brave 
soul clapped loudly and the rest of the girls followed suit, breaking 
into applause and rising to their feet.

Tamao blushed with the response, but Nagisa&#39;s face remained 
expressionless, her eyes staring straight ahead with her hands clasped 
behind her back. It felt like someone had bolted a lead block to the 
fourth year&#39;s heart, and she screamed inwardly at the thought of the 
months of added workload before her. It was only when she glanced across 
the tables to see Shizuma grinning back that her irritation subdued and 
she dipped her eyes as a fond smile spread to her lips.

Mina&#39;s words came back to her, and with a deep breath she raised her 
head to face the crowd, putting on a happy face for the cheering girls 
congratulating them.

The Sister continued her speech for a brief time longer, before handing 
over to Chikaru for the morning prayer. As the Sister and the staff 
left, Nagisa and Tamao took their seats at the head table with the two 
remaining council Presidents as the attractive Lulim girl gave the 
Lord&#39;s Prayer to the bowed heads of the gathered students.

- - - - -

&quot;Well that&#39;s certainly not how I&#39;d have reacted to being made Etoile,&quot; 
Chihaya proclaimed flatly. She brushed the falling snowflakes from her 
overcoat as she waited with her room mate at the Dormitory gates for the 
new Etoile to catch them up.

It was freezing outside, and snow had fallen throughout the night, 
covering the surroundings in a puffy white layer, replacing the missing 
leaves on the trees with a marshmallow coating instead. Chihaya wiped 
her face in irritation as further flakes drifted gently from above.

Mizushima turned her purple tinted head to her fellow fourth year and 
muttered in her dulcet tones,

&quot;What do you mean by that? They seemed happy enough when the Sister 
announced it to everyone?&quot;

Chihaya rolled her eyes at her room mate,

&quot;Not at breakfast, I meant last night you dummy.&quot; She stated 
matter-of-factly. &quot;What else could that have been about?&quot;

Mizushima pondered the question, and then finding herself without an 
answer, she replied,

&quot;You&#39;re always making fun of me.&quot;

Chihaya snapped back,

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t if you didn&#39;t act so stupid all the time,&quot; then she nudged 
the taller girl. &quot;Shush, here they come,&quot; and she nodded towards the 
Dormitory front entrance.

Nagisa, Tamao and Shizuma stepped out into the frigid air, Tamao off to 
one side as Nagisa and Shizuma discussed something in low tones, their 
heads bowed together. Tamao&#39;s body language was openly tense Chihaya 
thought, strange given her smiling face at the announcement only a few 
minutes earlier. Something was definitely going on and she&#39;d put money 
on it Shizuma was the cause.

As the trio approached the other girls, their feet crunching in the 
snow, Chihaya bowed politely, nudging Mizushima to follow suit.

&quot;Good morning Etoile-sama, Shizuma-sama,&quot; she said.

Nagisa scowled at the title, but it was Tamao that corrected them,

&quot;We&#39;re not the Etoile until the Ceremony at lunch time Chihaya-chan, you 
don&#39;t need to be so formal.&quot;

Chihaya straightened up and smiled,

&quot;Just getting some practice in,&quot; she said with a grin. &quot;Congratulations 
both of you!&quot;

Tamao scratched her head awkwardly, and smiled sheepishly in thanks. 
Nagisa simply blanked the sentiment and turned back to her discussion 
with Shizuma.

With the snow gathering pace and lessons due to start soon, the other 
three girls started off toward class without the couple, Tamao turning 
to call for room mate from halfway down the path that led away from the 
Dormitories,

&quot;Aren&#39;t you coming Nagisa-chan?&quot;

Nagisa waved her on in annoyance,

&quot;I&#39;ll catch up in a minute.&quot;

The dark haired Miatorian nodded and turned back to the other fourth 
years. Nagisa watched for a moment as they wandered off into the snow.

Shizuma glanced after them, and then returned her attention to Nagisa&#39;s 
vexed face.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to tell her anything my love; she&#39;ll draw her own 
conclusions.&quot;

Nagisa sighed, knowing her girlfriend was right but still a little 
anxious, the weight of the Etoile announcement having left her on edge 
and feeling jittery.

&quot;She already has,&quot; she replied, &quot;she thinks we met my parents.&quot; Her eyes 
sparkled as she teased,

&quot;Shizuma-sama has apparently lost out to an arranged marriage.&quot;

Shizuma chuckled softly, and then looked down lovingly into the red 
head&#39;s eyes.

&quot;We&#39;re fine until people notice mine and start putting two and two 
together. We&#39;ll deal with that when it happens.&quot;

Shizuma smiled mischievously,

&quot;Anyway, the only thing I can see myself losing you to is a bowl of 
profiteroles.&quot;

Nagisa threw a pretend glare back as she prodded the sixth grader,

&quot;Just you wait, in ten years time I&#39;ll be twice this size and you&#39;ll 
regret teasing me constantly. I&#39;ll force feed myself until I&#39;m as fat as 
a house the day after we get married, and then you&#39;ll be stuck with me 
for life.&quot;

There was a pause as Nagisa finished the sentence; the words lingering 
long after her lips had stopped moving. She looked up to find Shizuma 
was staring straight past her, a far off look in her emerald gaze.

Nagisa smiled wistfully, and tipped her head as she repeated,

&quot;The day after we get married...&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s pupils slowly returned to focus and she looked down, nodding 
softly,

&quot;Someday my love, some day...&quot;

And then with a beaming smile Nagisa threw her arms around the 
former-Etoile, clutching her tightly.

&quot;Oh Shizuma! Get me through this Etoile idiocy. God just get me to March 
and everything will be fine.&quot;

Shizuma was almost overwhelmed by the force behind Nagisa&#39;s embrace and 
having caught her balance just in time, she laughed as the younger girl 
gripped her dearly. She stroked Nagisa&#39;s soft red hair, the snowflakes 
resting in it melting as her fingers touched them.

&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. In two weeks we&#39;ll be curled up in front of a warm 
fireplace, drinking coffee and fighting over who gets to open their 
Christmas presents first.&quot;

Nagisa looked up from the warmth of their embrace,

&quot;We can do this can&#39;t we?&quot; she asked, and the older girl looked back 
with sincerity in her eyes,

&quot;They did.&quot;

Nagisa nodded and held Shizuma&#39;s gaze for a moment longer, then leaned 
forward to squeeze her girlfriend one last time before turning to hurry 
after the others, calling back over her shoulder,

&quot;Come find me before the Ceremony!&quot;

Smiling fondly, Shizuma stood in the falling snow, watching the red 
shock of hair disappear into the distance, the snaking trail of 
footprints and the soft perfume she could still smell the only trace 
that Nagisa had been there at all.

- - - - -

&quot;All done,&quot; the tiny brunette called with a spirited voice, her curls 
bobbing as she slipped off the stool she&#39;d been perched on.

Chikaru looked up from her mountain of paper work on the front desk, 
smiling at the little first year stood behind the first row of tables. 
Beckoning with her hand, she gestured for Kagome to join her at the 
front with the final few sheets she&#39;d just finished up for the school 
council President during their morning recess; the final preparations 
ahead of the afternoon&#39;s ceremony.

Kagome replaced the lid to her calligraphy pen and gingerly gathered up 
the parchments before coming to the front to place them on the desk 
before Chikaru. There was shine in the little one&#39;s green eyes, and she 
smiled up at the fifth year.

&quot;Can Kagome-chan help Chikaru-senpai with anything else?&quot;

Chikaru pondered for a second, tapping her own pen softly against her 
lips, and then she shook her head gently, replying quietly,

&quot;I don&#39;t think so Kagome, no. That should be everything we need.&quot;

She smiled warmly,

&quot;You&#39;ve been very helpful Kagome-chan, but you should run and get some 
refreshments before class. We&#39;re going straight to the Cathedral after 
and there won&#39;t be any lunch until the Etoile Ceremony is over.&quot;

Kagome nodded and shuffled off toward the door. As she opened it 
slightly, she turned to the older girl and happily pronounced,

&quot;Kagome-chan is glad to have helped Chikaru-senpai, she works very hard 
all by herself.&quot; After which she tried to leave, only to find that her 
path was unexpectedly blocked by the black uniform of the Miatorian 
school council President who towered over her in the door way.

Miyuki looked down at the first year she&#39;d almost tripped over with a 
bemused expression as the Lulim girl&#39;s face dropped and she nodded 
politely before sidling round the imposing obstacle to hurry off down 
the corridor.

Miyuki turned to her council colleague as Chikaru grinned back, giggling 
softly.

Miyuki raised an eyebrow at the expression, prompting Chikaru to share,

&quot;That one is full of surprises,&quot; the Lulim girl replied, &quot;I had no idea 
how she&#39;d react to the incident with Tsukidate-san. If I&#39;m honest, I 
feared greatly for her emotional well being,&quot; then as she motioned to 
the stack of beautifully penned programs before her she added, &quot;instead 
she&#39;s come completely out of her shell. She did all of these to help out 
during recess, seeing how snowed under I was. She&#39;s surprisingly capable 
too, look at the quality of this ink work.&quot;

Miyuki peered forward to look over the hand written programs, finding 
even herself impressed. Given the time frame in question, the quality 
was way above the expected standard.

&quot;Perhaps the incident with the teddy bear wasn&#39;t such a bad thing then,&quot; 
Miyuki remarked flatly, &quot;it seems to have benefited her and carrying a 
soft toy around high school is hardly appropriate for the school image.&quot;

Chikaru&#39;s return look hinted that Miyuki was being harsh, but she did 
concede to things having worked out well in the end,

&quot;I think we&#39;ll see great things from that child in time,&quot; she said as 
she stared at the half open doorway thoughtfully.

Then focusing on the moment in hand she placed her pen on the desk, 
resting her hands before her as she looked up attentively at the 
Miatorian stood before her, asking politely,

&quot;What can I do for you Rokujo-san? With the programs finished, do we 
have everything prepared?&quot;

Miyuki nodded, shuffling through the paper work on the desk before 
Chikaru.

&quot;I believe that&#39;s everything yes. All we need now is an uninterrupted 
Etoile ceremony and we can get back to normal again.&quot;

Chikaru&#39;s eyes sparkled as she considered the last attempt. Although she 
wasn&#39;t going to say it in front of the brooding sixth year stood over 
her, Chikaru was happy to have seen Shizuma back to her old self at the 
last election; both she and Nagisa looked extremely happy after the two 
painful years the former-Etoile had suffered alone. It was just a shame 
things hadn&#39;t worked out for the Spican pair afterwards, although she 
still held hope that the current state of affairs was just a temporary 
set back.

For a moment the Lulim girl pondered something over, something that had 
been nagging at her intensely since the meeting with Sister Mizue in the 
school council chamber the previous night. After a few seconds thought, 
and having realised Miyuki wasn&#39;t rushing to answer her question, she 
quietly offered,

&quot;Did you notice the rings Shizuma and Nagisa have started wearing?&quot;

Chikaru watched as Miyuki&#39;s expression shifted, and the fifth year 
continued, &quot;Matching platinum rings on own of their engagement 
fingers...&quot;

Miyuki looked up, stunned. Chikaru nodded at the disbelieving figure 
regarding her,

&quot;I take it you hadn&#39;t then. I first noticed them at the meeting last 
night, although Nagisa in particular seemed to be hiding hers. She was 
wearing it again this morning, although I didn&#39;t see Shizuma to check 
for hers.&quot;

The dark haired Miatorian stood for a moment, wide eyed and thinking the 
meeting through, trying to picture the couple as she&#39;d approached them 
at the table. Nothing caught her eye in the mental image however, and 
breakfast had been a blur of preparation leaving little there for her to 
recollect either.

She bit her lip for a second, then turned back to the fifth year in her 
checked uniform,

&quot;No, you&#39;re right. I hadn&#39;t.&quot;

Chikaru frowned,

&quot;Doesn&#39;t that break Miator&#39;s uniform rules?&quot; she asked.

Miyuki&#39;s eyes narrowed as she turned the matter over in her head,

&quot;If they&#39;re truly engagement rings...? Then no, it doesn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Can they be engagement rings?&quot; Chikaru looked perplexed.

&quot;Yes of course. By law our country only distinguishes homosexuality in 
the act itself Chikaru-san, not in other terms. If one of them actually 
proposed then the rings are valid and the school could get into a lot of 
trouble if it tried rejecting them.&quot;

Her lips twisted into a sneer with a thought,

&quot;Presuming there&#39;s parental support...&quot;

The Miatorian stood with a curled hand before her face, brushing the tip 
of her smooth thumb nail across her bottom lip, considering Shizuma&#39;s 
actions. Surely she wasn&#39;t that stupid; no family as wealthy as the 
Hanazono&#39;s would permit their daughter to run around embarrassing them 
so openly would they?

What was Shizuma up to? Was she really this bold?

Her sneer turned into a smile as she considered the ramifications. If 
this were all true, then things would only be easier when the two sixth 
formers left Astrea.

Miyuki folded her arms behind her back and gazed out of the window for a 
moment, before returning her attention to the Lulim girl.

She hadn&#39;t come to debate Shizuma&#39;s antics, although the information 
gained was as useful as it was startling. Concentrating on her initial 
aim however, she changed the subject.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t regarding the Ceremony,&quot; she said, then adding for clarity, 
&quot;the reason I came to see you that is.&quot;

Chikaru looked up from her thoughts, surprised by the sudden change of 
topic.

&quot;Oh? Is there something else I can help with Rokujo-san?&quot; she asked.

Miyuki skirted around the words for a moment, pacing a little before she 
stated flatly,

&quot;I came to make you a proposition.&quot;

Chikaru tipped her head in curiosity, and Miyuki began to elaborate,

&quot;Your creative streak has always impressed me Chikaru; the costumes you 
make, your outfits, your dresses.&quot; She gestured for effect, &quot;there are 
few people better dressed outside of term and none of them make their 
own clothes.&quot;

Chikaru was puzzled by the uncharacteristic compliment, but let Miyuki 
continue, interested to see where the conversation was going,

Miyuki went back to pacing as she worked her way to the point,

&quot;I was thinking that had I the opportunity to do something to thank my 
fellow council members before I leave in March, of everyone I&#39;d worked 
with you were the one that deserved recognition the most. After all, you 
do so much more for Astrea than most, yet you never ask for anything in 
return.&quot;

Chikaru was waiting patiently for the angle to present itself as Miyuki 
ran her fingers down the window pane in front of her, peering out across 
the valley below.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re aware Chikaru, but one of the industries the 
Rokujo family business deals with is the clothing sector.&quot; Miyuki turned 
to face Chikaru for emphasis, &quot;my father owns several design studios in 
Harajuku district&quot;

The dark haired Miatorian smiled,

&quot;I was talking to father only this weekend, and he was talking about the 
drought of inspired designers he&#39;s currently facing, when it occurred to 
me I&#39;d spent the past two years on the school council with one.&quot;

Chikaru leaned forward in interest, Miyuki having pushed the correct 
buttons all too well.

&quot;So to cut a long story short, he put it to me that if I knew someone, 
then if I were to provide him with an example of their work, he would 
consider them openly, even if they were still in education.&quot;

Chikaru found herself questioning the Miatorian&#39;s sincerity, but the 
idea of trialling for a professional studio was far too good to pass up. 
She inquired tentatively,

&quot;What kind of work was your father thinking of?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Well was it happens, I was hoping to have an old dress reworked for the 
Ball. If you were to take some measurements and I was to provide you 
funding for the materials, I thought perhaps you could redesign a dress 
for me over the next two weeks. That would give my father both the 
before and after product along with the paper process, all within a set 
project time.&quot;

She looked the Lulim girl directly with her dark eyes,

&quot;Would that interest you Chikaru?&quot;

The fifth year was certain Miyuki was up to something, but couldn&#39;t 
sanely reject the opportunity lying before her. Everyone at Astrea knew 
of the Rokujo wealth; their status and the resulting influence it 
carried; this could be the chance of a life time.


&quot;It sounds like an exciting challenge Miyuki-san. What did you have in 
mind for the finished product?&quot;

Miyuki traced a finger idly across her neck line as she gazed at the 
floor, her mind obviously elsewhere,

&quot;Miyuki-san?&quot; Chikaru repeated.

Without moving her gaze, the dark haired girl replied,

&quot;A resizing. And a modernization; I want to bring a dress up to date 
without changing the overall look too much. It has to conjure the same 
mental image,&quot; she said.

Then she looked up at the pretty fifth year, snapping out of her 
thoughts,

&quot;Shall I drop the dress round after the meeting tonight?&quot; she asked.

&quot;That sounds ideal,&quot; Chikaru nodded, smiling back hesitantly. The 
Miatorian President was acting very strangely, and Chikaru had no idea 
what she&#39;d done to provoke such a generous offer out of the blue.

Miyuki nodded politely, oblivious to the train of thought,

&quot;Then unless you need anything else Chikaru-san, I will be on my way. I 
need to check the Cathedral is ready.&quot;

Perplexed, Chikaru bid her colleague farewell and sat back on her stool, 
staring at the wall in stunned silence.

- - - - -

Soft murmurs echoed throughout the Cathedral&#39;s main chamber as girls 
from all three schools slowly filed into the stone building, taking 
their seats allotted by age and class. Unlike the previous ceremony, 
this afternoon&#39;s affair would be brief and to the point, with no 
reserved seating, no dances and only a brief piece from the Spican Choir 
to mark the occasion. To a degree, the second ceremony was a formality, 
but it served a social purpose nonetheless.

The raised area around the altar had been decked out with the usual red 
carpet and gold trimmings, with bouquets of flowers from the Green House 
lining the walls and tall standing candle sticks flanking the stone dais 
at the back.

Waiting on the altar was the intricate wooden case that housed the 
Etoile necklaces, and Miyuki&#39;s gaze strayed to it on a regular basis, 
almost able to taste the coming event.

As the hall filled out, Tamao, Shion, Chikaru and Miyuki stood in the 
shadows of the exit corridor that led to the private rooms at the back 
of the building, waiting for everyone to arrive while peering out from 
behind the soft folds of the hanging red curtains that covered the 
doorway.

Tamao stood behind the three council Presidents, looking anxiously at 
the side doorway that led to the snow outside. Catching Tamao&#39;s repeated 
glances toward the exit, Miyuki muttered,

&quot;I take it Nagisa is planning to grace us with her presence?&quot;

Tamao replied in an absent voice,

&quot;I think she went to find Shizuma.&quot;

Miyuki retorted impatiently,

&quot;You would have thought Shizuma would have grown bored of her by now.&quot;

She scanned her eyes across the mass of uniforms and faces, trying to 
judge how many more should be expected. Only the Spican sixth years were 
left unaccounted for as far as Miyuki could tell, and she doubted they 
would be much longer.

&quot;The sixth years are on their way from the changing rooms Shion?&quot; Miyuki 
asked, and the blonde sixth year nodded back at her, adding,

&quot;We should probably start to settle everyone down,&quot; after which she 
motioned to Chikaru before heading out into the chamber proper. Chikaru 
turned quickly to the quiet fourth year stood at the back, Tamao&#39;s dark 
hair tied with pretty Miatorian ribbons and looking splendid in her blue 
Etoile gown,

&quot;Break a leg Tamao-chan,&quot; she grinned, and then turned to follow the 
white uniformed girl ahead of her.

With just Miyuki left for company, the fourth year turned back to the 
door, her head bowed. The older girl sighed in irritation and remarked,

&quot;Well Nagisa wants to hurry up or she&#39;ll miss her own coronation.&quot;

&quot;Coronation Miyuki?&quot; Shizuma&#39;s soft voice echoed through the dark 
hallway as the couple appeared from one of the side rooms in the 
corridor behind them. Nagisa was clad in her red Etoile dress, her hair 
left lose, the auburn locks falling in waves as they framed her face. 
She looked uncomfortable and sullen, her eyes written with a submissive 
finality as she held the door for her girlfriend. Next to her, Shizuma 
carried forth an enormous bunch of flowers wrapped in clear plastic and 
tied with ribbons representing each of Astrea&#39;s three schools. She 
continued,

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t describe the beginning of a year&#39;s servitude as a 
&#39;coronation,&#39; more an execution.&quot;

Miyuki sneered in the shadows, but held her tongue as the silver-haired 
sixth year moved to stand beside her, Shizuma&#39;s heels ringing on the 
stone floor.

&quot;You forgot the presentation bouquet Miyuki,&quot; Shizuma said to her former 
room mate, the atmosphere between them unpleasantly dry, the 
former-Etoile&#39;s words clipped fine and carrying a sharp edge.

&quot;Distracted? You should know better,&quot; Shizuma finished as she stared 
straight into the council President&#39;s eyes.

Miyuki looked back wryly, reaching her arms out for the bouquet. As 
Shizuma transferred it across, Miyuki flicked her gaze towards Shizuma&#39;s 
left hand, catching the flash of metal in the darkness of the corridor. 
Her lips curled into a smile and she looked up at the Hanazono girl with 
bemusement. With staged surprise she replied,

&quot;How forgetful of me... I must remember to keep my mind off more trivial 
matters in future.&quot;

Shizuma caught the sentiment and raised her hand slightly in the gloom, 
turning it so that the ring caught the light again. She looked up at the 
brooding sixth year stood next to her, who was also staring at the 
platinum band, before reaching back to the fourth year behind,

&quot;Nagisa my love.&quot;

The downbeat red head stepped forward, curling herself into Shizuma&#39;s 
waiting embrace. As she did, Miyuki caught the glint of the second ring, 
confirming Chikaru&#39;s earlier description.

The two girls kissed softly, Shizuma whispering something into her 
girlfriend&#39;s ear before turning to leave. Whatever it was raised a brief 
smile, before Nagisa&#39;s face returned to its previous melancholy state.

Miyuki watched the exchange undeterred; her face emotionless, her eyes 
cold and scathing.

&quot;Congratulations Tamao-chan,&quot; Shizuma called over her shoulder, and then 
strode out into the bright chamber beyond.

Miyuki watched her go with a curt expression, before turning back to the 
Etoile-to-be.

&quot;Ready?&quot; she snapped.

Tamao nodded, and reached for Nagisa&#39;s hand, knowing full well they were 
required to enter the Cathedral together. Nagisa looked at the out 
stretched fingers before her for a moment, trading glances with both 
Miyuki and Tamao; the look of a song bird considering its cage with 
total and utter contempt.

&quot;For the record, I never wanted any of this,&quot; the young woman said, 
sighing as she took Tamao&#39;s hand in her own.

&quot;Well it&#39;s upon you regardless. Wait here until I motion for you both,&quot; 
Miyuki replied in a blunt tone.

And as the school council President stepped into the chamber before her, 
the floating voices of the Saintly Chorus rose in unison.

- - - - -

Yaya shivered in the cold air outside the Cathedral, her hair wet from 
the falling snow, her heavy Spican overcoat pulled tightly around her. 
From within the heavy oak door next to her she could hear the ceremony 
as it proceeded, Chikaru&#39;s soft voice building the collected girls into 
a tense frenzy ahead of crowning the two Miator students.

The Spican third year couldn&#39;t physically stomach being in the stone 
building; the memory of Hikari&#39;s face twisted in horror as she stared up 
from the snowy ground still burnt into Yaya&#39;s mind. The sheer weight of 
remembrance alone was enough to keep her from joining her class mates in 
the aisles, and she stood outside instead, wishing the last few days 
were merely a bad memory.

As the Choir trailed off, she heard the Lulim President&#39;s soft voice 
begin the Ceremony proper, and she stared off across the valley, taking 
in the snowy fields and the bitter sea beyond. She bowed her head in 
shame, blaming herself for Hikari leaving and Amane having to resign, 
hating herself for her lack of discretion and for leaving her room mate 
alone for so long when she&#39;d promised to hurry back. Had Yaya displayed 
a little more self-control, the sickly third year wouldn&#39;t have come 
traipsing out in the snow to find the two girls in the Cathedral, and 
none of this would have happened.

And it wasn&#39;t as though she could blame Tsubomi either; the awkward 
first year had only been mimicking Yaya&#39;s actions, doing exactly what 
the dark haired girl had made her believe was normal for two young girls 
in love to do. If love was even close to the correct word.

Yaya grimaced and set her jaw in self-loathing. This whole situation was 
so grossly unfair, yet so fittingly punishing at the same time. Life 
wasn&#39;t without a sense of irony it seemed.

- - - - -

&quot;And so, for the duration of this winter and the forthcoming term, 
Astrea&#39;s new Etoile is from Miator Girls&#39; Academy; Suzumi Tamao-sama and 
Aoi Nagisa-sama!&quot;

Applause rippled throughout the chamber as Chikaru concluded, and the 
fourth years waited by the altar as the three council Presidents 
approached the couple, Shion carrying the wooden Etoile case in both 
hands before her. Nagisa stood regarding the box as though it were a 
coffin, the weak smile on her face only there for the hundreds of eyes 
fixed upon her and Tamao. Despite the open door and the chilling breeze, 
the chamber was uncomfortably hot, the air thin. Amongst the hoards of 
faces, she couldn&#39;t even find the solace of Shizuma&#39;s beautiful eyes to 
fall back on.

The procession stopped beside her first, and having taken the blue 
pendant from the case, Miyuki turned to Tamao with the open necklace 
chain hanging between the slender fingers of each hand. The dark haired 
fourth year bowed her head, and Miyuki reached forward to close the 
clasp behind Tamao&#39;s neck, underneath her long flowing hair. As the 
first of the new Etoile straightened up, Miyuki smiled,

&quot;Congratulations Etoile-sama,&quot; she offered, after which she took the 
younger girl&#39;s raised hand before returning the bow politely. Tamao 
smiled, replying,

&quot;Thank you Rokujo-san.&quot;

Miyuki turned, taking a soul-destroying step closer to Nagisa, and the 
red head tried to gather herself as the Miatorian President removed the 
second pendant from the lined wooden box that Shion held beside her. 
Watching the blood red stone as Miyuki brought it toward her, Nagisa 
took a deep breath and drew her resolve as she looked into the sixth 
year&#39;s dark brown eyes. Miyuki smiled in satisfaction as Nagisa bowed 
her head to receive the necklace, watching carefully for the younger 
girl&#39;s expression as she straightened up, the symbolic representation of 
her new title hanging around her neck like a noose.

Nagisa was determined to hold her strength as she had done at the 
meeting the previous evening, but as she raised her hand for Miyuki to 
take, she saw the sixth year focus on the shining ring adorning the 
engagement finger before her, Miyuki&#39;s lips curling into a cynical sneer 
as she regarded the new Etoile.

She&#39;s laughing at me... at us.

Nagisa&#39;s resolve shattered as she saw the sadistic look of achievement 
in the burning brown eyes staring at her. Miyuki was indeed smiling; she 
knew exactly what the ring represented and yet for some reason unknown 
to Nagisa, she seemed completely unphased, mocking the ring as though it 
meant nothing at all.

If anything, she almost looked pleased.

Nagisa wanted to recoil, to shrink back from the school council 
President and pull her hand away, but in front of every student in 
Astrea and the Sister&#39;s watchful gaze, she knew she had to conform to 
tradition. Slowly, Nagisa returned her hand to her side and watched with 
building trepidation as Miyuki finished her bow and returned to her full 
height, her piercing stare locking back with Nagisa&#39;s eyes, her words 
laced with poison,

&quot;Congratulations Etoile-sama,&quot; she said, and waited expectantly for 
Nagisa&#39;s reply.

The red head stared back, her emotions churning, the room and its many 
occupants all watching her and her alone. She couldn&#39;t see Shizuma, 
couldn&#39;t find a source of consolation. With a look of defeat, her heart 
plummeting, the new Etoile replied in a submissive tone,

&quot;Thank you Rokujo-san.&quot;

After which Miyuki&#39;s lips curled again, before the school council 
President wheeled with a swish of her uniform, leading the procession 
away.

Nagisa barely heard the applause as Tamao raised her hand into the air 
between them, didn&#39;t register the rows of smiling faces or the gathering 
song of the Saintly Chorus off to her flank. All she could see was 
Miyuki&#39;s glittering eyes, the look of accomplishment in them and the 
sneer on her lips as she&#39;d held the fourth year&#39;s hand before her.

She wanted to turn and run from the chamber, desperately needed to find 
Shizuma and wrap herself in her lover&#39;s arms.

Looking down at the floor, the shine of crimson drew her attention to 
the pedant hanging around her neck. With her free hand she raised the 
silver clasp, turning it so the stone faced her. She saw herself in the 
blood red surface; the sullen school girl in the image nothing like the 
proud young woman that had stood on the fountain with her girlfriend the 
previous day.

- - - - -

As the rising applause echoed from the vaulted chamber within, Yaya 
turned with a start as the side door burst open, slamming against the 
brick work as the tall figure of Amane Ohtori strode from the Cathedral, 
one hand covering her face as she hurried back in the direction of the 
dormitories.

Yaya watched her go with a falling expression, knowing all too well how 
the former-Etoile was probably feeling. She watched as Amane disappeared 
into the falling snow, her dark bob blown by the wind, clutching herself 
for comfort with her head lowered.

Just as Amane disappeared from view, the slender figure of Spican 
council President Shion Tomori appeared in the doorway, her face red and 
her breathing heavy.

&quot;Ohtori-san?&quot; she called, &quot;Ohtori-san!&quot;

Her tone was abrupt, the embarrassment of Spica conceding the Etoile 
compounded by Amane running off as soon as the ceremony was complete, 
and without offering the customary congratulations to her successors, 
even if they were only temporary replacements.


Shion took a few timid steps into the snow, her short skirt offering 
little protection from the elements and her overcoat stowed somewhere 
within the Cathedral behind her.

&quot;Amane!&quot; she called,

Yaya sighed and pushed herself away from the wall,

&quot;Leave her be, don&#39;t you think she&#39;s gone through enough already?&quot;

Shion turned at the unexpected voice, already flustered and further 
annoyed by the disrespectful tone.

&quot;Nanto-kun? Mind who you&#39;re speaking to,&quot; she snapped, then thinking a 
moment more, she added, &quot;You should be in the hall with the others.&quot;

The third year snorted at the condescending attitude, replying through 
gritted teeth,

&quot;I&#39;m fine just here.&quot;

Then after a pause, she brashly added,

&quot;And had you not pushed them into the election mess in the first place I 
wouldn&#39;t need to be out here either, would I?&quot;

Thoughts of finding Amane gone, Shion turned with rage in her eyes, her 
back straight and her arms crossed. She stared at the younger girl as 
the wind whipped her long golden locks around her,

&quot;Exactly who do you think you&#39;re talking to?&quot;

Yaya glared back,

&quot;I don&#39;t know, you tell me? From where I&#39;m standing you look a lot like 
the reason my life has fucked itself up so merrily.&quot;

The ability to transfer the suffocating guilt was refreshing; Yaya&#39;s 
emotions boiling over and the words coming with gratifying ease. Of 
course it&#39;s her fault, Yaya thought to herself, after all, had she not 
pushed the couple into the Election then there may still have been a 
chance for her and Hikari, rather than the immediate closure that the 
position had brought. Hikari and Amane were never going to work out, and 
her room mate would have come round eventually. And even if not, Yaya 
certainly wouldn&#39;t have rushed head long into the self-destructive mess 
with Tsubomi.

What had she been thinking; in the Cathedral of all places? The Yaya 
Nanto that had rescued the tiny blonde from Kaname Kenjo&#39;s unwanted 
clutches, that had stood supportively beside her best friend as she 
drifted into the arms of another suitor would never have done something 
so foolish, so cheap. She was better than that, and it was the council 
President&#39;s interference that led her to the recent but oh so costly 
mistakes she&#39;d made through loneliness and desperation.

Shion&#39;s blue eyes glazed over, and she stalked towards the girl 
regarding her with a purposeful stride. She motioned towards the 
Cathedral with a pointed finger, her face set with an authoritative air,

&quot;Join your class immediately, and don&#39;t you dare speak to senior student 
like that again or I&#39;ll have you in front of the Sister!&quot;

Yaya raised her chin, her pulse racing and her muscles tense,

&quot;Something wrong President? Does the truth sting a little?&quot;

Shion was beginning her own transference, the days of shame following 
Hikari leaving the school, the embarrassment of the council meetings, 
the demeaning lectures from Miyuki; all of it lay somehow at the door of 
this loud mouthed third year. After all, she had been the last person to 
speak to the blonde Etoile before her trip into loopy-land. This must be 
Nanto-kun&#39;s fault. Who else did she have to blame but her own pride?

The two girls squared up to each other, and out of ear shot, quiet 
murmurs passed between the crowd of girls now leaving the Cathedral, 
eager to get their lunch and surprised by the scene taking place 
outside. The aggressive stance of the two Spicans facing off drew raised 
brows and hushed whispers.

&quot;Well?&quot; Yaya snapped, the adrenaline clouding her mind. She needed to 
lose these pent up feelings and the confrontation had her on the edge of 
doing so. She pushed harder, subconsciously looking for the excuse she 
needed.

&quot;How does it feel, knowing you screwed those two girls&#39; lives up just to 
make yourself look good?&quot;

Shion snarled,

&quot;How dare you!&quot;

Yaya was inching forward, her hands clasping and unclasping at her side, 
her eyes narrow arcs of black mascara and dark eyelashes. She ground her 
teeth in agitation, waiting for Shion to respond.

Tense seconds passed, and the crowd of onlookers fell completely silent.

Shion simply stared back, something inside keeping her from crossing the 
boundary between verbal confrontation and physical hostility. Too much 
time was ticking away and Yaya&#39;s conviction began to break; inwardly the 
wall of hate and loathing started to slide away and she clawed 
desperately for a reaction,

&quot;Come on you bitch; you&#39;ve taken everything else away from me, at least 
give me this!&quot; she yelled.

But her words fell on deaf ears, and Shion simply blanked the angry face 
before her, turning to walk away.

That was all Yaya needed,

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare turn your back to me!&quot; Yaya screamed, reaching forward 
and grabbing the soft fabric of the President&#39;s uniform sleeve with one 
hand, drawing a closed fist back with the other.

Shion struggled as she was pulled backwards, turning to face the younger 
girl in surprise.

But as Yaya stood poised to strike, she looked into the wide blue eyes 
before her, fear and shock staring back, her mind racing. This wasn&#39;t 
right, it wasn&#39;t Shion&#39;s mistakes that had led Hikari to leaving; it was 
her own. It wasn&#39;t Shion that had tried forcing herself onto Hikari in 
their dormitory, that had abandoned her best friend to get herself off 
with a cheap substitute in the Cathedral.

These were Yaya&#39;s mistakes, this was Yaya&#39;s shame.

And unable to move, she stood there, fist raced, eyes glazed, lip 
trembling.

This was all wrong.

&quot;Nanto-kun! Let go of the President immediately!&quot;

A cocktail of fear and relief washed over the third year as she lowered 
her hand, releasing the torn sleeve of the older girl before her.

Sister Mizue&#39;s seething voice rang across the courtyard,

&quot;Go to my office, now child!&quot;

- - - - -

&quot;The driver will take you to Hikari&#39;s road and wait until you need 
bringing back again. There&#39;s already a message waiting for Sister Mizue 
in her office from the estate stables; unless she&#39;s feeling particularly 
nosey everything should be fine, and even then Kei will be happy to 
cover for you if she rings. Just don&#39;t be too long.&quot;

Shizuma tipped her head, trying to catch Amane&#39;s gaze as she stood 
before her at the gate to the Astrea grounds.

Beside the girls, a black limousine hummed quietly, the passenger door 
open and waiting for Amane to enter.

The fifth year was quiet, mulling over what she planned to say to Hikari 
if she managed to see her, what she would ask and how she would progress 
the conversation.

She was nervous, more so than she&#39;d ever experienced whilst riding, more 
so than prior to any exam.

Terrified wouldn&#39;t be far off the mark.

She looked up at the graceful figure before her,

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I can do this Shizuma.&quot;

Her brown eyes were full of doubt, her expression pensive.

The Miatorian tried to looked reassuring, smiling fondly,

&quot;You miss her right? You need answers?&quot;

Amane nodded reluctantly,

&quot;Then this is worth it Amane; just follow your heart and you&#39;ll be 
fine,&quot; Shizuma continued.

The tall fifth year paused briefly, then reached forward, awkwardly 
hugging the girl before her,

&quot;Thank you Shizuma. You&#39;ve been so supportive.&quot;

Her emerald eyes sparkling, Shizuma smiled back, placing a fond hand on 
Amane&#39;s arm.

&quot;I may be in a meeting when you get back, but as long as nothing goes 
wrong we&#39;ll stop by your room on the way back to mine after. Keep a pot 
of tea warm eh?&quot;

Amane managed a grin before turning to board the waiting vehicle,

&quot;What if she doesn&#39;t want to see me anymore Shizuma?&quot; she asked, her 
face dropping again.

Raising a hand to brush her wind swept hair from her face, the black 
clad figure replied softly,

&quot;Then at least you&#39;ll hear it from her lips and not someone else&#39;s.&quot;

Stepping forward to push the door closed behind Amane, Shizuma stepped 
back as the car pulled away, waving gently as the limousine disappeared 
down the hill.

- - - - -

&quot;And furthermore, between lessons and meals you will remain in your 
Dormitory until your parents come to collect you in a fortnight&#39;s time. 
You will not attend club activities, and you will not be permitted to 
attend the Christmas Ball.&quot;

The grey haired woman wrapped her cane across the table with a sharp 
crack, jolting Yaya back to attention.

&quot;Are you listening to me Nanto-kun? Your conduct this afternoon was 
disgusting. Do you even have an explanation?&quot;

Yaya hung her head again, words failing her and a strange sense of 
disorientation taking the third year as she stood in the middle of the 
room, exhaustion overwhelming her from a week of eating poorly and 
sleeping little. She longed for a return to normality; anything to close 
her eyes and find herself back in her Dormitory with Hikari, chatting 
about her tiny room mate&#39;s unrequited love for Amane and Kaname&#39;s latest 
attempt at distracting the third year. With a sigh she looked up again 
at the Sister who was sat behind her desk in the tiny administrator&#39;s 
office on the bottom floor of the Dormitory building.

Quietly, Yaya replied,

&quot;No Sister. I haven&#39;t been myself since the incident with Hikari-chan. I 
apologise for my behaviour.&quot;

The grey haired woman stared back for a few moments, then turned from 
the girl in front of her, reading over several notes on her desk, 
frowning as she looked as one in particular.

Turning back to Yaya she sighed heavily and rubbed her brow in 
agitation.

&quot;Go and get some sleep Nanto-kun. Report to me in the morning before 
class.&quot;

Yaya nodded attentively.

&quot;You may go,&quot; the Sister finished, her attention returning to the 
telephone message scribbled by the Dormitory secretary and left for her 
while she&#39;d been at the ceremony.

The dark haired third year stepped backwards, turning and opening the 
door to the office. As she stepped out into the corridor, she found 
herself greeted by a shock of pink hair and Tsubomi&#39;s worried 
expression, the first year stood against the wall in the hallway, her 
hands rung in a knot in her lap.

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot;

- - - - -

Amane stared at a pair of high metal gates in the failing evening light, 
the sky taking on a red tint as the sun began to set.

She&#39;d left the limousine at the other end of the short road, Shizuma&#39;s 
driver asking if she needed any further assistance before settling down 
to wait for the Spican to return.

The Konohana house was set back at the end of a expensive looking 
cul-de-sac; the well maintained houses flanking it each having high 
walls and ornate black gates, the bare branched trees in each garden 
poking into the sky from behind the stone work, their drive ways and 
entrances lit by cold coloured perspex globes set amongst the 
surrounding shrubbery.

The few hundred yards to the imposing gate before her had taken an age, 
and as Amane drew closer, her mind had wandered to the tiny third year 
she&#39;d spent the past few months courting.

She pictured the pretty face, the soft blonde curls and the striking 
blue eyes, Hikari staring up at her from the edge of the paddock, 
leaning on the white fencing as she watched Amane ride.

Had Amane done the wrong thing? Had Hikari&#39;s attentions really been 
indicative of the younger girl seeking a relationship, or had the fifth 
year merely fabricated the idea in her own mind to fill the yawning gap 
of loneliness she&#39;d contended with over the years.

Amane shook her head, and looked again at the metal box on the side of 
the gate, the illuminated plastic button across the bottom of the panel 
marked with the kanji for service.

She stared at the symbols written across the box blankly, her courage 
and conviction somewhere far, far away.

Beyond the gates, not far and close enough to make out some of the 
details behind the thin lace curtains in those rooms whose lights were 
on, Amane could see Hikari&#39;s house; a large building several floors high 
and angular in a very gothic sense; all granite stonework and black 
piping.

In the middle of the ground floor stood an intimidating entrance way, 
with statues and evergreen shrubs cut into figures bordering the door. 
Up lighters shimmered across the walls of the house, further adding to 
the dominating feel.

Amane bit her lip and looked back at the push button, picturing Hikari&#39;s 
face again, remembering the smell of her hair, the softness of her skin.

&quot;Angelic...&quot; she muttered to herself, and with a deep breath she slammed 
the box with her thumb.

There was a soft buzz from the unit, and the fifth year hung her head as 
she waited, resting a hand against the cold stone wall.

A moment later, a quiet voice called through the speaker,

&quot;Yes, may I help?&quot;

A lump rose to Amane&#39;s throat, but swallowing hard, she replied 
politely,

&quot;Hello. Is this the Konohana residence?&quot;

The speaker crackled as the woman on the other end replied,

&quot;It is. Can I help?&quot;

Amane looked up at the windows, her eyes searching for the familiar 
blonde hair,

&quot;My name is Amane Ohtori. I was hoping to speak to Hikari if she&#39;s 
available.&quot;

The fifth year strained but couldn&#39;t see anyone in the windows, waiting 
impatiently for the person at the other end of the telecom to reply.

&quot;May I ask what you want with my daughter? She&#39;s not well and I&#39;m not 
eager to disturb her.&quot;

Amane&#39;s heart leapt. She was here.

The tall Spican leaned into the box, pressing the button to respond,

&quot;I&#39;m a friend from Spica Girls&#39; Institute. I desperately need to speak 
to her Mrs Konohana.&quot;

The speaker hummed for a few seconds, then went quiet, the response 
obviously having been halted.

For several uncomfortably long seconds, there was nothing but the sound 
of the wind.

Amane&#39;s heart pounded and she put a hand to her head to steady a rising 
sensation of giddiness.

&quot;We are not taking visitors from the school. Please leave our gate,&quot; 
came the curt reply.

Amane looked at the telecom in horror, staring up at the window, 
urgently seeking some form of recognition amongst the rooms,

&quot;But please, I need to speak to Hikari. I need to talk to her,&quot; she 
replied, panic under cutting her voice.

Amane looked again at the silent box, rising tears beginning to choke 
her.

&quot;Please, if she&#39;s there just tell her it&#39;s Amane. Please!&quot;

A man&#39;s voice replied this time, short, deep and aggressive,

&quot;Go away or I&#39;ll call the police.&quot;

The Spican stepped back, her head reeling.

This wasn&#39;t fair, she was so close. Holding her hands to her head, Amane 
looked again at the house and in the corner of one of the first floor 
windows she swore she caught movement behind the gathered lace curtain 
tied neatly to one side.

&quot;Hikari!&quot; she cried, calling into the evening air, &quot;Hikari!&quot;

But no reply came, and as defeat washed over her, Amane looked at the 
grey box on the gateway wall, realising a phone call to the police would 
be difficult to explain to the Sister given she was supposedly at the 
Hanazono Estate Stables.

Shaking her head, she looked once more at the window she thought she&#39;d 
seen movement in, and then slowly turned back toward the car, her heart 
dissolving, a hollow ache filling her chest.

And as the failed Etoile shuffled slowly toward the waiting limousine, 
two brilliant blue eyes misted over with tears, staring down at the 
slender figure walking away from the house through the netted lace 
curtains gathered against the edge of a first floor window, soft blonde 
locks resting against the cold bedroom wall and a similarly heavy heart 
aching as the distance to the tiny figure outside increased.
