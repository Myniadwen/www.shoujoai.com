<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 7 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a>

<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Get to the point Shion, where does that leave the Etoile?&quot; Miyuki 
snapped, her patience wearing thing.

The Miatorian President was growing tired of the Spican fifth year&#39;s 
constant habit of skirting the truth of the matter, and pressing the 
point further, she demanded, &quot;have you even spoken to Amane to found 
out?&quot;

In light of Hikari&#39;s departure from the Astrea Hill Dormitories for the 
duration of fall, the school council Presidents had called an emergency 
meeting the following morning to discuss the implications and decide how 
to proceed. The three had gathered together in the council chambers, 
Chikaru perched on the edge of the wide wooden table, Miyuki and Shion 
stood on either side of her. The Lulim President sat with her hands in 
her lap, listening politely as the dark haired Miatorian trampled over 
the disadvantaged Spican. Miyuki was obviously relishing the occasion; 
her hostility tangible, and her words sharp and cutting.

Shion stumbled over her reply to Miyuki&#39;s question,

&quot;I&#39;ve not had the chance to speak to Amane yet. I&#39;m not sure anyone&#39;s 
seen her since Hikari left.&quot;

Miyuki rolled her eyes,

&quot;So who gave grace last night? Or this morning for that matter?&quot;

Again, the blonde Spican had to respond awkwardly, knowing full well 
that Miyuki would capitalize on her answer.

&quot;In the end, Sister Mizue stepped in,&quot; then in an attempt to claw some 
ground back she added, &quot;weren&#39;t you there yourself to see?&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s brown eyes twinkled and narrowed into poison tipped slants, 
catching but not rising to the bait. She knew she&#39;d flaunted her own 
responsibilities by not appearing for either of the meals since her 
fight with Shizuma, but given the exchange with the former-Etoile, 
Miyuki had wanted to wait for her nerve to return before risking the 
possibility of encountering her old room mate again. She pondered 
explaining the matter away, but opted not to. Instead she drove her own 
blade home, finishing the Spican off deftly,

&quot;Your school holds the Etoile, and yet despite losing part of that 
pairing, you&#39;ve not even located the other half to find out whether or 
not she&#39;s capable of continuing alone? Despite Amane already neglecting 
her duty twice since Hikari left?&quot;

Shion bite her lip, trying to think of some way to come back. There was 
none however, and Miyuki enjoyed the coup-de-grace,

&quot;Let me remind you Shion; the day following Sakuragi-san&#39;s death, 
Shizuma was present at the dining hall table to give grace at breakfast. 
Despite her sorrow and pain, she didn&#39;t once fail to uphold her duty. 
Part of that was having her School council President there at her side, 
supporting her through that ordeal; which is exactly where you should be 
right now.&quot;

Shion lowered her eyes, knowing that wasn&#39;t always the case, but also 
aware she was too far down to fight back now. Instead, she simply opted 
to take Miyuki&#39;s berating words and be done with it.

&quot;Sort your Etoile out Shion. If she&#39;s incapable of continuing, we need 
to act on that decisively. We only have two weeks until the Christmas 
Ball, and there&#39;s still the matter of the winter discharge papers and 
the spring events to deal with before term ends. We have a 
responsibility to the staff and the students to act in a timely manner 
when situations like this arise; it&#39;s the reason our post exists. We&#39;re 
here to set the leading example.&quot;

Appropriately satisfied, Miyuki stood awaiting Shion&#39;s reply; the Spican 
only managing a weak nod before excusing herself, her blue eyes burning 
with rage as she strode off to find Amane.

Miyuki smiled inwardly as she watched the blonde girl leave, the heavy 
wooden doors swinging wildly as they banged closed behind her.

Chikaru broke the following silence, her words measured in their 
delivery,

&quot;You enjoyed every second of that didn&#39;t you Miyuki?&quot; the pretty Lulim 
girl asked.

Miyuki raised an eyebrow, unsure of the tone. Chikaru continued,

&quot;What&#39;s done is done. Why did you have to rub it in?&quot;

The older girl looked at Chikaru in bemusement, her dark eyes sparkling 
with venom,

&quot;Unusual to see you taking sides Chikaru; has your fence post grown 
uncomfortable?&quot;

Chikaru replied in a level tone, her voice not betraying any underlying 
emotion,

&quot;I&#39;m just uncomfortable with your aggression Rokujo-san. We should be 
rallying around each other in a situation like this, not taking the 
opportunity to point fingers.&quot;

Miyuki sighed, and inwardly she acknowledged she&#39;d probably vented a 
little too much of her anger from the encounter with Shizuma during the 
meeting. She would need to keep her temper more carefully measured if 
she were to get what she wanted from future weeks.

She replied,

&quot;Perhaps... But it was irresponsible of Shion not to have consulted 
Amane before arriving here. This was nothing more than a waste of time 
and I have finals in the spring, let alone my council duties to attend 
to. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re in a similar position.&quot;

Chikaru had to give the Miatorian that much, and nodded softly. Time was 
dragging on and rumours were running rife about Hikari&#39;s departure, an 
official explanation for which hadn&#39;t yet been given.

&quot;We&#39;ll need to say something at dinner, regardless of what happens with 
Amane-san, or things will get out of control,&quot; Chikaru reasoned.

Miyuki nodded.

After a pause, she turned to leave herself, Chikaru calling,

&quot;What of Tsukidate-san Miyuki? Have you passed the issue to the staff?&quot;

Miyuki stopped, one hand resting on the door handle as she glanced back 
over her shoulder a wry smile across her lips,

&quot;No, I&#39;ve dealt with that issue myself. Chiyo Tsukidate seemed so 
defensive of her position cleaning for the fourth year girls that I 
found her an appropriate task to channel her enthusiasm.&quot;

Chikaru raised a curious eyebrow, prompting Miyuki to laugh openly,

&quot;Take a walk around the Dormitories later. You&#39;ll see what I mean.&quot;

And with that the Miatorian left, her vindictive smile lasting long 
after she passed the Dormitory gates.

- - - - -

Momomi leant heavily on the stone boarder of the roof edging, her gaze 
following the dark haired Etoile as she wandered towards the stables on 
the path below the Spica school building. From her vantage point on the 
roof top, Momomi could see for miles, even in the poor light of the 
winter months. She pondered the lonely figure, Amane&#39;s head hung low, 
her shoulders slumped as she walked to her morning practice at the 
paddock.

She looked utterly distraught.

Glancing over her shoulder at the other infamous figure Spica was 
renowned for producing, Momomi smiled as she considered her words,

&quot;It would appear your mighty idol has finally failed at something,&quot; and 
then with relish she added, &quot;What a pity to see her term as Etoile 
faltering so quickly.&quot;

Kaname was perched opposite, leaning back across the wall, propped up on 
her elbows with her head tilted backwards and her face catching what sun 
there was to be had before the clouds gathered again.

Her eyes still half closed, she regarded her room mate suspiciously.

&quot;What plays on your mind Momomi? Is it worth me asking?&quot;

The petite Spican turned to sit facing the lounging fifth year, tipping 
her head to one side.

&quot;I&#39;m just wondering how you feel, knowing you stepped aside for the 
infallible Ohtori-sama, now that she&#39;s succeeded in losing her Etoile 
partner only a week after being elected.&quot;

Kaname turned back to the sun, shutting her eyes again whilst trying to 
ignore the comment. Momomi hadn&#39;t shut up since the election, taking 
every possible opportunity she had to punish the taller girl. Yet 
despite their previous break up and the chance to walk away, here she 
still was, following Kaname around like a lost kitten.

Kaname&#39;s lip curled, her temper getting the better of her as usual. She 
returned her gaze to the annoyingly attentive fifth year sat opposite,

&quot;And what would you have me do now dear Momomi? Race to Shion and demand 
a re-election?&quot; She sighed, &quot;You know as well as I do that the 
suspension is only temporary. For all it matters, Hikari may well return 
in January only for the staff to treat her as though nothing had 
happened.&quot;

Momomi smiled at her partner&#39;s agitation, having achieved the desired 
effect. Kaname caught the look and scowled, muttering,

&quot;Change the record Momomi.&quot;

The tall fifth year ground her teeth and stared off across the valley in 
the other direction. Her relationship with her room mate had been 
troublesome since the ceremony. At first, when she&#39;d originally 
approached her partner after conceding the race for Etoile, she&#39;d hoped 
to smooth over their past and start afresh. But despite the brown-haired 
temptress being so obviously glad to continue their relationship, they 
regularly came back to the same point of contention.

Momomi just wouldn&#39;t let it go, however hard her lover tried.

Events with Hikari and Amane had been a turning point for Kaname. Deep 
inside, deep down, Hikari&#39;s words the morning of the tennis match had 
changed something. The tiny blonde had opened the older girl&#39;s eyes to 
what she&#39;d allowed herself to become.

The tall Spican had rarely struggled at school; she found classes easy, 
excelled at the sports she participated in, drawing the other girls to 
her with little effort. It didn&#39;t take long for her to find herself on 
top of the pile and destined for a place on the school council. There 
was even talk of her entering as Etoile in the years to come. Certainly 
at that stage, it had been a long time since she&#39;d had to work hard to 
impress anyone, it all just came naturally. But that all changed with 
the arrival of one person.

When Amane had transferred to Spica, it was as though a second sun had 
entered the midday sky. Slowly but surely, that alluring new figure had 
gnawed at Kaname, eaten away at her popularity and status, out doing her 
no matter how hard she tried to keep pace.

What made it worse was that it seemed so totally unintentional. There 
was never any malice in Amane&#39;s behaviour, she just did what she did; 
and did it better than Kaname ever could.

Over time it had ground Kaname down, her bitterness increasingly marked 
in her character, her scheming nature developing slowly but surely, 
fuelled by Momomi&#39;s continued insistence that the dark haired Spican was 
destined to out-do her rival. The petite fifth followed her room mate 
unquestionably, never faltering in her approval or application of 
anything that came to Kaname&#39;s mind in her attempts to go one better, no 
matter how immoral or undesirable it might be.

Eventually, with the almost obsessive need to win the race for Etoile. 
Kaname had found herself under that tree with Hikari, left dumbstruck 
when the tiny third year pointed out the truth of what she was doing.

In a way, Kaname wished she could rid herself of Momomi altogether; the 
overwhelming urge to start over and rediscover herself hampered by their 
entangled situation and Momomi&#39;s ability to make herself totally 
in-disposable. And extremely alluring.

Like a wasp in a summer garden Kaname thought. So terribly eager to get 
in the way so it could sting you.

She looked back at the pretty face, the shapely figure. Momomi glared 
back, unaware of the train of thought,

&quot;And what if she doesn&#39;t come back Kaname? What then?&quot;

The taller girl snapped, replying,

&quot;Is it worth worrying over? We have the whole of Christmas ahead of us 
yet. We can deal with the possibility in January.&quot;

Momomi scowled, not happy to drop the subject,

&quot;What happened to your spine Kaname?&quot; she sneered, &quot;Did that pathetic 
air head truly get the better of you?&quot;

The dark haired fifth year sat forward, her patience having run out,

&quot;I&#39;m done talking about this Momomi, I&#39;m sick of hearing it.&quot; Kaname 
scowled at the ease with which her lover could enrage her.

&quot;Drop it. Or perhaps you&#39;d rather find somewhere else to go so I can be 
alone and get some peace?&quot;

Momomi averted her gaze, lowering her head and muttering back,

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

With no more smart replies forthcoming, Kaname turned to look back 
across the valley and watch the world go by some more, lost in her own 
thoughts.

Nagisa sat staring at the black board as her French teacher read from 
the course text book. She heard the words, but her mind was elsewhere, 
following idly as it concentrated on more pressing things. Occasionally, 
she&#39;d glance sideways at the dark haired figure sat next to her, unsure 
of whether or not Tamao had noticed her looking, pondering the previous 
day&#39;s conversation in their dormitory.

Shizuma and Nagisa had spent the night in the attic, huddled up under a 
pile of blankets and dust sheets, shivering and laughing at their 
inability to sleep under such hostile conditions. Most of the time 
they&#39;d passed talking, their conversations broad and sweeping, 
discussing things that previously they&#39;d never bothered with or had time 
for. A little about Shizuma&#39;s family, bits about Nagisa&#39;s youth away 
from Astrea, the source of Shizuma&#39;s strange obsession with European 
music; anything and everything as they fleshed out each other&#39;s history 
in their own minds, their hearts wanting to know every last detail about 
their partner.

But eventually, despite the cold and the sound of the wind howling 
outside the windows, exhaustion had beaten the two girls and they&#39;d 
fallen asleep, entwined together in a heap of white dust sheets and 
black Miator uniforms.

With the lack of curtains in the attic, they&#39;d risen early with the sun, 
and watching Miyuki stride off towards the council chambers, they&#39;d 
returned to Shizuma&#39;s room to freshen up before the day&#39;s lessons, such 
was Nagisa&#39;s unease with returning to her room with Tamao alone.

She hadn&#39;t spoken to Shizuma about the conversation with Tamao however, 
just as she&#39;d promised the other fourth year. It played on her mind 
heavily though, and the question of Tamao&#39;s behaviour and how she had 
managed to instil such invasive feelings still nagged endlessly. Why the 
sudden change? And why, if Tamao was so serious about her, was her room 
mate being so accommodating of Shizuma? What was Tamao trying to 
achieve?

Perhaps Nagisa was just being paranoid. Not everyone in life has an 
angle, and after all, Tamao had acted in a perfectly normal manner when 
Nagisa and the former-Etoile stopped by the fourth year&#39;s room to pick 
her books up. Tamao had been her usual chirpy self, and happily 
accompanied the pair to breakfast after.

Still, that look in Tamao&#39;s eyes... the tone in her voice as she&#39;d run 
her fingers through Nagisa&#39;s hair.

&quot;Aoi-san?&quot;

Nagisa jumped.

&quot;Uh, sorry Sensei. The next page Sensei?&quot;

Everyone was looking at her, and her face flushed as she started reading 
the following paragraph from the book lying open before her.

In the corner of her eye she caught Tamao looking at her, and she 
stumbled over the line she was reading.

&quot;Sorry, um, et tout....&quot; She continued.

And at the edge of her peripheral vision, she thought she saw her 
roommate smile.

- - - - -

Chiyo sighed as she left her maths class, knowing what lay ahead of her. 
She trudged along the hallway toward the main door of the impressive 
Miator building, heading back to the Dormitory to continue the 
punishment given to her by President Rokujo for her actions towards the 
tiny Lulim girl.

She walked with her head bowed; the shame of her predicament and the 
guilt of Kagome&#39;s screams still hanging heavily over her. She clutched 
her school bag before her for comfort, knowing full well she wouldn&#39;t be 
able to forget the look in Kagome&#39;s eyes for a long time to come.

What had she been thinking, Chiyo asked herself. Such a stupid thing to 
do, and what had it achieved? If anything her onee-sama would despise 
her even more now.

If she even remembered she had a room temp that was. It felt like weeks 
since Chiyo had last seen the fourth years, and she cursed herself again 
for her actions.

The journey back to the Dormitories seemed to take forever, and the 
little first year hurried her short legs along to get there as quickly 
as possible, hoping to start before the majority of the other girls 
returned from class.

Rushing to the cleaning cupboard on the ground floor, she muttered to 
herself as she donned her apron, grabbing the bucket she&#39;d left to one 
side with the gathered equipment she needed in the bottom. Peering 
either way down the corridor as she poked her head out of the cupboard, 
she quickly closed the door behind her while the coast was clear and 
rushed down the hall to where she&#39;d left off.

With a little luck she would get enough done before too many people saw 
her, and be able to go to lunch at the same time as the other girls. 
Rokujo-san wasn&#39;t going to inspect her progress until later that 
evening, so she should have plenty of time to catch up after she&#39;d 
eaten, and then continue after the day&#39;s remaining classes while the 
girls were busy elsewhere for the evening.

Kneeling as she reached the task in hand, she took a dirty looking 
toothbrush and rag from the bucket, placing a tin canister of liquid and 
a soft polishing cloth on the floor next to her.

Working away furiously, she blushed in embarrassment as the occasional 
student passed by, staring at her in confusion.

They weren&#39;t people she knew however, and gritting her teeth, she got on 
with her job, thanking someone on high for their mercy.

That was, until she heard familiar voices behind her.

Chiyo&#39;s heart dropped, and she went bright red as the familiar figures 
of Chihaya Takemura and her room mate Mizushima walked down the corridor 
towards her; the two girls that lived in the Dormitory opposite Nagisa 
and Tamao.

They were deep in conversation about something or other, and Chiyo 
ducked her head, trying to huddle as close to the wall as possible in 
the hope that they wouldn&#39;t recognize her.

The conversation came into ear shot as they drew close,

&quot;...Yui-san seems to think they&#39;ll call another election, although I 
can&#39;t see that myself. Surely Hikari-chan will just retake her position 
when she returns? She can&#39;t have left Spica for good, can she?&quot; Chihaya 
asked as she fiddled with the ends of her hair, her brow furrowed in 
deep thought as she looked to her taller companion for an answer.

Mizushima shrugged her shoulders, her sea-blue eyes gazing elsewhere.

&quot;I mean, if she&#39;d left for good, surely the school council would have 
said something by now?&quot; Chihaya continued.

Mizushima failed to answer, and Chihaya wrapped the dippy brunette 
across the arm to wake her up.

&quot;Did that purple hair die go to your head?&quot;

Mizushima baulked, rubbing her arm before pouting back with a hurt look,

&quot;What was that for?&quot;

&quot;I was talking to you and you were ignoring every word I was saying!&quot; 
Chihaya replied.

Her room mate pointed at the tiny first year huddled against the wall,

&quot;I know, but I was wondering why Chiyo-chan is cleaning the air vents 
with a toothbrush.&quot;

Chihaya looked down at the first year before her feet; Chiyo sat before 
one of the antiquated brass air vents, furiously brushing the layered 
dust from the ornate grating.

Chihaya scowled and she looked back at Mizushima with an unimpressed 
look in her eyes,

&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear? She beat up Kagome-chan.&quot;

Mizushima&#39;s jaw dropped.

&quot;Little Kagome? With the teddy bear?&quot; she asked, unable to believe her 
ears.

&quot;Uh huh, ripped her teddy up and everything,&quot; Chihaya replied.

Chiyo stopped brushing, her head bowing even further, and nervously 
awaited the other girl&#39;s reaction, her little heart thumping in fear.

&quot;Is that true Chiyo-kun?&quot; Mizushima demanded, her green eyes narrowed as 
she stared at the first year&#39;s back.

Chiyo swallowed hard and slowly turned around to look up at the fourth 
year glaring down at her.

&quot;I, um, that is...&quot;

Mizushima&#39;s face dropped in disgust.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe someone would stoop so low.... why I should!&quot;

Mizushima raised her hand in anger for second, violent thoughts crossing 
her mind. But then she dropped it again, unwilling to get herself in 
trouble. Shaking her head she turned to walk away.

&quot;God that&#39;s so pathetic. I can see why they&#39;ve got you cleaning the muck 
from the hall way now, although you don&#39;t even deserve that much.&quot;

- - - - -

Yaya stood hands on hips, purveying the scene before her. Tired, she 
sighed and scratched the back of her head before stretching her aching 
back out. She knew full well things were still looking far from normal, 
but she&#39;d tried her best and worked all morning to reconstruct the 
girl&#39;s dormitory; gathering up the broken glass and plastic from the 
floor before wrapping it carefully in tissues and placing it carefully 
in the bin. She&#39;d tidied up the books and clothing she&#39;d thrown around 
in her fit of rage, and even managed to source some replacement curtains 
from the cleaner&#39;s cupboard, the shredded originals lost somewhere in a 
skip outside while the other girls were in lessons. It wasn&#39;t a bad 
effort, although she couldn&#39;t replace the wall mirror until the weekend, 
and there was no simple way of explaining away the light fitting. The 
look on the janitor&#39;s face when he&#39;d been called to fit the new one was 
a picture, Yaya having claimed she&#39;d knocked it whilst reaching up to 
chase a spider off; the old gent looking the tiny Spican up and down in 
dubious amusement. He&#39;d said nothing to the Sister however, a fact that 
Yaya had thanked him for silently.

No one had asked too many questions about Yaya cutting class, taking the 
situation with Hikari into consideration, totally unaware of the truth 
behind what had happened the previous day in the Cathedral. Whatever 
other emotions she felt, Yaya was extremely thankful to Hikari for 
leaving the situation unexplained. At least she didn&#39;t have the 
embarrassment of everyone knowing the whole story to contend with on 
top.

Exhausted, she sat herself down on the edge of her bed, shivering 
slightly and wondering if she&#39;d caught a cold after sitting for so long 
in the freezing shower. Her face was flushed and sweaty, although she 
didn&#39;t know if that were the lack of food or something else entirely. 
She hadn&#39;t been able to face eating that morning, and her stomach was a 
confused mess of hunger pangs and nauseous indigestion. She held the 
back of her palm to her forehead, but decided the test was inconclusive 
since her hand was just as hot as the rest of her.

She looked again toward the empty bed opposite her and her heart sunk, 
the same guilt and shame that had led Yaya to smashing the room apart 
washing over her. It wasn&#39;t fair, after everything else she&#39;d suffered 
whilst watching Hikari slowly drift from her and into Amane&#39;s arms, now 
she had to cope with this on top. It seemed that no matter what Yaya 
did, she&#39;d gotten it wrong before she started.

Her train of thought disturbed, the Spican turned with a start to the 
sound of a soft rap on the door. She brushed her hair back behind her 
ears quickly, straightening her night shirt out in her lap before 
calling,

&quot;Hello?&quot;

A shock of Strawberry hair and pea-green eyes, Tsubomi&#39;s head poked 
around the corner. She smiled meekly, asking,

&quot;Is it okay if I come in Yaya-chan?&quot;

After a gentle sigh, Yaya nodded softly and the first year shut the door 
quietly behind her, moving to sit on the edge of the bed next to her 
dark haired companion.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know if you&#39;d be up yet,&quot; Tsubomi said, then looking around 
the room she remarked, &quot;you&#39;ve cleaned up well.&quot;

Yaya tipped her head slightly and fiddled with the bed cover, eager to 
avoid the other girl&#39;s gaze.

Tsubomi looked at the third year, noticing the sullen expression and the 
lowered eyes.

&quot;How is Yaya-chan feeling this morning? Did you sleep?&quot;

Yaya shrugged, and shook her head, but didn&#39;t elaborate on that. Tsubomi 
sat for moment in the awkward silence before pressing for an 
explanation,

&quot;Have I upset you Yaya-chan? Should I go?&quot;

Yaya glanced at the younger girl, then running her hands through her 
hair she pulled herself backwards to sit against the wall, her legs 
crossed underneath her on the bed, trying to cope with the thought of 
idle conversation,

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly Tsubomi, I&#39;m just over tired that&#39;s all.&quot;

She tipped her head slightly and fiddled with the hem of her night 
shirt,

&quot;How was class? Did anyone say anything?&quot;

Encouraged by the beginnings of a conversation, the first year replied 
eagerly,

&quot;There were a few odd looks, and some of the girls asked if I&#39;d heard 
anything. No one seems to be equating us with what happened though. They 
only know what you were the first to find Hikari, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Yaya looked relieved, and Tsubomi continued,

&quot;A couple of the older girls from your class asked where you were. I 
said you were probably sleeping. They seemed okay with that.&quot;

Yaya thanked the other Spican and looked at the ceiling with a long 
sigh. Closing her eyes, she let the darkness take her, rolling her head 
to relax her shoulders a little. The underlying sense of stress didn&#39;t 
diminish however, and the world seemed just as stark when she reopened 
her eyes.

At least no one was asking awkward questions.

She looked at Tsubomi briefly, taking in the look of concern, the pretty 
green eyes, the delicate cheek bones and rounded nose. She was a pretty 
thing; not as pretty as Hikari by any sense of the imagination, but 
attractive nonetheless, and amusingly feisty when she wanted to be. 
She&#39;d enjoyed their time together after the election immensely and had 
things not been complicated by her long standing friendship with Hikari 
and events at the Cathedral, life would probably have taken a 
refreshingly enjoyable turn for a change.

But there you have it, life and Yaya always seemed to be at odds.

A pang of regret hit her, but she&#39;d decided long before the first year 
had arrived what needed to be done, and although the older girl hadn&#39;t 
wanted to have this conversation so soon, she bite her lip in the grim 
realization that this was the most appropriate time to do it. She took a 
deep breath before beginning,

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to think you&#39;ve done anything wrong Tsubomi-san; you 
haven&#39;t. You were really supportive yesterday and with all my heart, I 
thank you for that.&quot;

Tsubomi&#39;s young face dropped at Yaya&#39;s tone, and she waited for the 
third year to continue with an anxious look in her eyes,

&quot;It&#39;s just... after yesterday, after seeing Hikari like that, and 
knowing that was because of us... I don&#39;t know. I need some space 
Tsubomi; I need some time to think,&quot; she said. She sighed as she watched 
Tsubomi&#39;s expression dropping, and pressed on, trying to explain her 
feelings more clearly, each word making the situation unintentionally 
worse for the strawberry haired first year,

&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to be with you anymore, really I do. I just 
can&#39;t. Not now, I need to figure this out in my own head and I can&#39;t do 
that with you here with me all the time.&quot;

She shook her head, knowing she was going full pelt in the wrong 
direction,

&quot;We&#39;ve been so full on since the election, I just - &quot;

&quot;Yaya-chan, please stop.&quot; the first year cut in.

Tsubomi looked sad as her mind resigned to Yaya&#39;s words, but she put a 
brave face on as she continued,

&quot;I understand, its okay, really it is. I&#39;ll just wait a while and let 
you get yourself together again. I&#39;d be the same if it were my best 
friend.&quot;

She tried badly to hide the growing sense of rejection, the tears 
pooling at the corner of her eyes,

&quot;After all, you&#39;ve known Hikari-chan so long; I&#39;d be just as...&quot;

It wasn&#39;t working, and she covered her face quickly as she felt a tear 
break.

&quot;I&#39;ll leave you in peace then,&quot; she muttered quickly from behind her 
cupped hand, sniffing and hurrying to the door.

&quot;I hope Yaya-chan feels better soon. And... she knows where I am if she 
needs me.&quot;

&quot;Tsubomi,&quot; Yaya called after her, but as quickly as she&#39;d came, Tsubomi 
was gone, the door clicking softly as she pulled it too, her footsteps 
echoing as she ran off along the corridor.

Yaya sighed. At least she&#39;d made it easy.

- - - - -

Nagisa had been quiet during lunch, and as they walked back toward 
Miator, Shizuma looked across at the red head, wondering if the fourth 
year was just tired or if something was wrong.

The sun was surprisingly pleasant for the winter months, and for the 
first time in a few days, the snow had almost completely melted, the sky 
bright blue as the girls enjoyed their time away from class. A 
refreshing but cool breeze blew through the bare trees, and the pair 
could hear the sound of the few remaining winter birds in the 
surrounding brush.

&quot;Tamao-chan is going to meet you at class?&quot; Shizuma asked, shaking her 
hair out with her free hand, the other clutching her satchel and 
umbrella.

&quot;She said she had something to submit to club before we went to Science 
Lab for the afternoon,&quot; Nagisa replied idly, her mind elsewhere.

Shizuma studied Nagisa&#39;s troubled expression as they walked, then deftly 
caught the younger girl&#39;s arm and turned her sharply so she they were 
facing each other directly. Looking down into the brown eyes staring 
back, Shizuma smiled.

&quot;What&#39;s gnawing at you my love, you&#39;re miles away?&quot;

Nagisa sighed and bowed her gaze a moment, shuffling her foot on the 
ground. She looked up again and replied with a tired frown,

&quot;I want to tell you something Shizuma-sama, but it&#39;s,&quot; she paused, &quot;it&#39;s 
a bit like the Yaya thing.&quot;

Shizuma raised an eyebrow, and then let Nagisa&#39;s hand go so they could 
continue the walk to class. Nagisa described her inner turmoil as they 
walked,

&quot;Tamao said some things when you were with Amane and Yaya. She was...&quot;

Nagisa searched inwardly for the words, wondering how much would be too 
much. Failing to navigate that particular minefield, she opted to stay 
indeterminate instead.

&quot;She&#39;d asked me not to tell you what she&#39;d said.&quot;

Shizuma pondered obviously for a moment, and then shrugged 
indifferently,

&quot;Then don&#39;t. Although I can tell whatever it was she doesn&#39;t want me to 
know is vexing you.&quot;

Nagisa scratched the back of her head and sighed in agitation. She 
looked back across at the former-Etoile.

&quot;I...&quot;

And then as something dawned on her, suddenly she smiled.

&quot;Thank you Shizuma.&quot;

The silver haired sixth year looked back in surprise,

&quot;Whatever for?&quot;

Nagisa beamed,

&quot;For being Shizuma-sama and brushing it off, rather than acting like 
Nagisa-chan and throwing a tantrum.&quot;

Shizuma laughed, replying with a grin,

&quot;I didn&#39;t say I wasn&#39;t curious.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s smile faded, and she bowed her head again in thought. The two 
girls continued in silence for a bit, Shizuma giving Nagisa the time she 
obviously needed.

The girls stopped as they reached the turning for the Science Labs, a 
department exterior to the main Miator building. Shizuma was going the 
opposite direction for her French class.

&quot;Can we stay in your room tonight Shizuma-sama?&quot; the fourth year asked, 
her gaze somewhere off across the valley.

Shizuma nodded,

&quot;Of course. Although I get the distinct impression it&#39;s not because you 
want the privacy for another lesson from Sensei?&quot;

Nagisa didn&#39;t respond to the tease, looking very serious as she regarded 
her girlfriend directly,

&quot;I don&#39;t trust myself with her Shizuma. I don&#39;t trust her with me on my 
own either.&quot;

Shizuma looked into the younger face for a moment, searching Nagisa&#39;s 
expression. The brown eyes staring back were calm, the thoughts behind 
them collected.

&quot;Why so worried? Do you think she&#39;s trying to make a move on you?&quot;

Nagisa sighed and shrugged awkwardly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I just know I&#39;m spending far too much time thinking about 
the things she said and the way she said them. I don&#39;t feel comfortable 
around her alone Shizuma, I&#39;m worried I&#39;ll do something stupid, simply 
because this is all so new to me.&quot;

Shizuma was left considering the manner of Nagisa&#39;s admission, and 
rather than firing her pride or panicking her, she found the words 
making her admire the red head even more. She knew then and there, more 
so than she ever had before, that the couple would have no secrets 
between them; that Nagisa would never lie to her.

She glanced sideways thoughtfully for a second, then replied in a soft 
voice,

&quot;Do you believe that just because we love other women that we&#39;re 
incapable of staying true to our commitments? That being what we are 
makes us immoral?&quot;

Nagisa blanched a second at the depth of the former-Etoile&#39;s question. 
Then taking in Shizuma&#39;s words and considering her own feelings since 
the conversation with Tamao, she replied quietly,

&quot;I&#39;m not sure. Perhaps? I just feel unsure of myself I guess Shizuma.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s eyes took on a fond look, and she cupped Nagisa&#39;s cheek with 
her free hand.

&quot;By all means, we&#39;ll stay in my room tonight if that would make you feel 
more comfortable, although I want you to know Nagisa; I trust you 
completely,&quot; and with that she paused for emphasis. &quot;But tomorrow 
afternoon, while the other girls are at club, I&#39;m going to take you to 
meet someone. Perhaps you&#39;ll feel a little better after.&quot;

Nagisa tipped her head in intrigue and asked,

&quot;To meet who Shizuma-sama?&quot;

Shizuma smiled knowingly, and replied,

&quot;Someone very dear to me. Someone who proved to me a long time ago that 
loving another woman doesn&#39;t make you a monster.&quot;

After Chihaya and Mizushima had bumped into the embarrassed first year 
in the Dormitory corridor, news of Chiyo&#39;s deeds and resulting 
punishment had spread throughout the day, passing from student to 
student, classroom to classroom. By the time the tiny Miatorian had 
resumed her work after the evening meal, an angry crowd had formed 
around Chiyo, leering and insulting her as she worked, the tiny girl 
practically in tears. She knew that she had to continue for fear of 
Miyuki&#39;s wrath, but desperately wanted to run away somewhere and curl up 
in a ball.

&quot;What a bitch, I can&#39;t believe someone could be so cruel,&quot; one girl 
called loudly. &quot;It&#39;s like beating up your granny,&quot; another added, 
kicking Chiyo&#39;s feet as they watched the first year work.

The names that some of the girls were calling her, the venom in their 
insults had cut deep, and as time went on, the young student slowly 
resigned to their words, realizing what a monster they thought she was; 
what a monster she must be to deserve them.

She hated herself, wishing she could die quietly and go somewhere else 
to start over so everyone would leave her alone.

Bowing her head, she tried to block the voices out as she worked 
furiously, trying to end the ordeal as soon as possible.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; a familiar voice called, then again louder over the 
din, &quot;what is the meaning of this?&quot;

The crowd piped down, and the collected girls turned to look at the 
former-Etoile as she stood in the middle of the corridor, Nagisa beside 
her, regarding the situation with a suspicious eye.

&quot;Former-Etoile Hanazono-sama,&quot; a Spican girl politely explained, &quot;this 
girl beat up the first year from Lulim that carries the teddy bear with 
her. Rokujo-san has her cleaning the brass work as punishment.&quot; Then 
with a sneer the prissy blonde added, &quot;Although she deserved much 
worse.&quot;

Nagisa strained to see the figure huddled next to the wall through the 
crowd, and nudged her way forward so she could make the face out.

&quot;You mean little Kagome Byakudan?&quot; Shizuma asked, and the Spican nodded. 
Shizuma raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Chiyo-chan?&quot; Nagisa called, her face dropping in disappointment.

The tiny first year froze, finally hearing Nagisa&#39;s voice over the 
crowd.

Her heart broke then and there, knowing her onee-sama had seen her for 
what she was, the evil monster that beats up little girls.

Shizuma snapped,

&quot;Whatever President Rokujo had in mind, I doubt very much it involved 
Tsukidate-kun being mobbed by a crowd of girls old enough to know 
better. Now find something else to do before I have you all in front of 
the Sister.&quot;

At that the crowd dispersed, bowing politely and hurrying off in 
different directions.

Nagisa was stood next to Chiyo, looking down at the tiny first year.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d do something like that Chiyo-chan.&quot;

She shook her head as Chiyo turned to face Nagisa, tears running down 
her cheeks, her words all jumbled as she rushed to get her explanation 
out,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Nagisa-onee-sama, I really am. I didn&#39;t mean to hurt 
Kagome-chan, but she went to President Miyuki and I had to tell the 
school council about Shizuma-sama staying in Nagisa-onee-sama&#39;s room. I 
was so angry at Kagome for making me break the secret. I was worried my 
onee-sama would hate me and tell me that she didn&#39;t want me as her 
little sister anymore.&quot;

Chiyo dipped her head, feeling ashamed and desperately sad.

Nagisa sighed,

&quot;So you lashed out at Kagome?&quot;

Chiyo nodded slowly, her tears coming with a quivering bottom lip.

&quot;Oh Chiyo-chan, what a silly thing to do,&quot; Nagisa replied, and she 
stroked the tiny first year&#39;s hair.

Chiyo looked up in surprise, having expected another barrage of insults 
and abuse at the hands of her onee-sama as she had from the other girls. 
Instead, she received a look of disappointment and dismay,

&quot;Did any of those girls hurt you?&quot; Shizuma asked in a flat tone.

&quot;No former-Etoile-sama, not really. They just said things.&quot;

Shizuma sighed, looking around.

&quot;How long did President Rokujo specify you to do this for?&quot; the silver 
haired sixth year asked, agitation lacing her voice.

Chiyo bowed her head and replied,

&quot;She didn&#39;t say. Rokujo-san is going to visit me just before seven to 
inspect my work.&quot;

Shizuma looked at Nagisa, then again at the tiny first year at her feet.

&quot;This is demeaning and wrong. Collect your things together and take them 
back to where they belong. Then go clean yourself up and apologise to 
Kagome-chan. When you&#39;ve done that, go to your room for the night and 
contemplate the lesson of this experience. I&#39;ll deal with Rokujo-san.&quot;

Chiyo looked up in surprise.

&quot;But former-Etoile-sama, she said - &quot;

Shizuma snapped,

&quot;I don&#39;t care what she said, I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s enough. Now go and 
apologise to Kagome before I drag you there myself.&quot;

Chiyo nodded respectfully, and then got up from her knees, gathering her 
cleaning equipment together before hurrying off to the cleaning cupboard 
to store them, trying to form the words of her apology to Kagome in her 
mind. Just before she passed out of ear shot, Nagisa called,

&quot;And Chiyo-chan, I won&#39;t be there in the morning when you report for 
room temp duty, but I&#39;ll expect you there all the same, is that clear?&quot;

Chiyo turned and nodded, trying to hide her smile of joy as she excused 
herself.

With the first year out of ear shot, Shizuma turned to Nagisa with an 
annoyed look on her face,

&quot;Just when you thought Miyuki had stooped as low as she could...&quot;

Nagisa sighed.

&quot;You&#39;re going to speak to her about this?&quot;

Shizuma nodded thoughtfully, gazing in the direction the first year had 
left by.

&quot;I&#39;ll have to or it will fall back on Tsukidate-san.&quot;

Nagisa smiled wryly,

&quot;Another night in the attic then?&quot;

Shizuma smirked at the thought.

&quot;Yes, quite possibly my love.&quot;

- - - - -

Amane leant on the door post of the barn, hands holding both ends of a 
towel that hung around the back of her neck, her hair damp from the 
shower she&#39;d not long taken. Watching the sun slowly set, she looked 
across the paddock, deep in thought. She&#39;d ridden all day, trying to 
keep her mind from events with Hikari, although the distraction hadn&#39;t 
worked particularly well. Star Bride had noticed his rider&#39;s 
preoccupation, and as a result the pair&#39;s timing was far off pace, the 
jumps hesitant and edgy, the gallops sloppy and slow. Amane shook her 
head, knowing full well it wasn&#39;t going to get any easier in a hurry.

She felt like she&#39;d had her mouth stitched up, unable to respond, unable 
to express; the one person she desperately wanted to talk to taken 
anyway, removed from her presence without a single word of goodbye or 
explanation.

Her heart ached, her chest feeling as though it would burst open with 
the pain. And all the time, there was the same underlying feeling of 
shame; the knowledge that somehow, somewhere her actions had led Hikari 
to this, whatever this had actually entailed. She didn&#39;t even know the 
truth of what had happened, simply that the tiny blonde was gone.

She sighed, and turned to leave, stopped by a low voice from the shadows 
behind her.

&quot;Shion is looking for you.&quot;

It was Kaname, although Amane had no idea how long the other fifth year 
had been stood there.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Amane managed, trying to force herself to remain social.

&quot;I believe it&#39;s regarding the Etoile,&quot; Kaname added, then after an 
awkward pause she mumbled, &quot;if there&#39;s anything I can do Amane...&quot;

The Etoile looked at the dark haired Spican in surprise, Kaname propping 
up the wall, her face unusually emotional and a look of sympathy in her 
deep brown eyes,

&quot;Thank you Kenjo-san,&quot; Amane replied, asking &quot;Where is Shion now?&quot;

&quot;I think she&#39;s returned to her room,&quot; Kaname answered. &quot;I&#39;m surprised 
she didn&#39;t think to come here. Perhaps she was scared of what she might 
find.&quot;

Amane looked back at the setting sun and then smiled wryly,

&quot;Worried her beloved Etoile isn&#39;t up to the job anymore I would 
imagine,&quot; she muttered, before bidding Kaname her leave.

- - - - -

The conversation with Shion had been short and to the point; Amane 
having decided what she was going to say long before she&#39;d reached the 
Spican President&#39;s bedroom door.

With a soft rap, she&#39;d summoned Shion to the doorway, the slender blonde 
looking uncomfortable in her night shirt and kimono. Amane had kept 
things brief,

&quot;Kaname said you were looking for me President?&quot;

Shion had nodded, about to launch into a long speech about duty and 
self-sacrifice, but the tall Spican had cut her short,

&quot;If it&#39;s about the Etoile, then my answer is simple; I can&#39;t continue 
alone,&quot; and with that, she&#39;d placed her blue Etoile stone in her school 
President&#39;s hand, closing Shion&#39;s fingers over it slowly.

&quot;Not without her.&quot;

And with that, Amane had turned and walked away, Shion left standing 
speechless before her open door.

Looking back over her shoulder as Amane strode toward her own room, she 
felt one of many, many weights lifted from her shoulders.

- - - - -

&quot;Miyuki open up,&quot; came Shizuma&#39;s voice from the other side of the door, 
the tone serious and demanding.

Miyuki started and jumped up from her desk, rushing to the door handle, 
making sure it was locked before hastily replying,

&quot;I&#39;m busy Shizuma, can&#39;t it wait?&quot;

The school council President stood staring at the closed bedroom door 
for a moment, her heart pounding in her chest, waiting nervously for the 
next reply.

She stood wearing only her night shirt, but it wasn&#39;t her attire that 
left her on edge.

&quot;It was regarding Tsukidate-san,&quot; Shizuma called.

&quot;What about her?&quot; Miyuki asked bluntly, her mind racing.

&quot;I&#39;ve told her to stop your cleaning punishment and to apologise to the 
Lulim girl directly. She was being bawled at by a crowd of girls.&quot;

Miyuki glanced sideways at the door, then back at the pile of paperwork 
on her desk. She paused for a moment, before calling back,

&quot;Fine. That seems reasonable. I&#39;ll speak to her in the morning.&quot;

There was an extended silence, after which Miyuki called,

&quot;Is there anything else Shizuma?&quot;

She held her breath for a second,

&quot;No, just that.&quot;

&quot;Fine, goodnight.&quot; Miyuki replied, and then listened intently, trying to 
catch the sound of Shizuma&#39;s footsteps. To her relief, instead, she 
heard the dull click of Shizuma&#39;s door handle, followed by a thump as 
the heavy wooden door closed behind her.

Miyuki let her breath out sharply, looking at her bedroom door a few 
moments more before returning to her desk.

She looked over the paperwork scattered across the wooden surface 
intently, trying to remember where she&#39;d made it up to before the 
disturbance. Her mind clicking in recognition, she hurriedly continued 
sketching out the floor plan she was working on, looking between her 
amassed documents every now and then before finalising details.

Her mind was alive with the task, busy recollecting the tiniest of 
details, fishing for the finer points of an event several years in the 
past, trying to get as much on paper before the morning as possible.

When faced with the most elusive of memories, the tiniest of points to 
recall, she&#39;d gaze across the room at an elegant blue cocktail dress 
hanging from one of her shelves, the outfit much too small for her now, 
but providing a source of flooding imagery from the night in question. 
After a few seconds staring at it, whatever she was trying to recall 
would pop into her mind, and she&#39;d furiously scribble the information 
down before she lost it again.

It would take a fair amount of work before that dress would fit her 
again she thought, considering ways in which she could deal with that 
problem, knowing the quickest and easiest would be to find a way of 
appropriating Chikaru&#39;s skills with a needle and thread.

Another problem for the morning she thought to herself; a way of putting 
the Lulim President in her debt.

But that could wait for now, her immediate time taken up with the 
reconstruction work taking place on her desk.

And with a smile on her lips, Miyuki relived her past, planning her 
future.
