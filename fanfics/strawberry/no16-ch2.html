<a href="../strawberry/no16-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>That strange feeling

Yaya woke to the sight of the brightly lit room. She tiredly tried to 
look around as she wondered where she was. She made note that she wasn&#39;t 
in class, nor was she home... the white lights, the white curtains, the 
smell of medicine and disinfectants. &quot;The infirmary...&quot; she mumbled to 
herself, it was one of those places she rarely gets to visit because she 
was quite a healthy young lady and she had a funny but not out of the 
ordinary fear of needles. Turning her head from side to side, she 
checked if she was alone and seeing no one at least within the area 
covered by white curtains.

She sat up and smiled... It was an instinctive response. She hated the 
color white. And after she had forced herself to smile at the face of 
something sad or painful, lying to herself that she was fine or that it 
didn&#39;t bother her over and over again... all of it... made it easier to 
show a realistic smile. She had forgotten it... she had not needed to 
think about it or it just didn&#39;t come to mind the past years.

&quot;It hurts...&quot; she muttered as she placed her right hand over her heart. 
She wasn&#39;t sure whether it was the bad kind of hurt... the kind that she 
felt that made her leave the female sanctuary that was Astraea Hill or 
was it the good kind? The one that told her she was alive? Or was that a 
bad kind of hurt as well?

She turned to the table beside her and was relieved to see her bag on 
the small table beside her bed. She took out a thick black notebook, it 
was hard bound with a thick leather cover that shielded the pages from 
all sides and one would think it&#39;s a box rather than a diary. She undid 
the simple knot she made with the red ribbon that she kept in place of a 
lock, almost laughing at herself when it took her longer than expected 
to do so. She hadn&#39;t written anything in a while. She actually hoped 
that she didn&#39;t have to anymore. But a peculiar event today, peculiar as 
was the adjective she chose for it, and she decided to write on her old 
black journal as she promised herself she would. She then wrote 
something that was in her mind on to the black stationery using a steel 
blue ink pen that was encased with the note book and two other colors, 
gold and silver. Finishing what she wanted to write down, she closed the 
diary, retied the slight faded ribbon after replacing the blue pen she 
was using back into the pocket and returned it into her bag.

She felt a little better now. Still a little sluggish... but she was 
never again a morning person. Not that she had experienced fainting 
before. She then placed diary back into her bag before lying down again.

And just in time too... The sound of loud and fast footsteps would have 
completely escaped the raven&#39;s still lethargic attention had the door 
not suddenly slid open with loud &quot;BANG!!&quot; as the door hit the other side 
of the door frame.

&quot;Yaya-chan!!&quot; she heard someone calling her, in a very panicked voice. 
But Yaya still half a sleep couldn&#39;t recognize whose voice it was.

&quot;SHHHH! Satou-san! Please be remain quiet she might still be sleeping!&quot;

&quot;Ah... sorry...&quot; the tall blonde sheepishly smiled as she apologized to 
the school doctor.

&#39;Ah...It&#39;s just Sei...&#39; Yaya told herself quite unsure of her own tone. 
She didn&#39;t know why, but she was surprised... and oddly not. Confused by 
that she decides not to bother thinking about it. And luckily she didn&#39;t 
really have a choice in the matter.

The sound of a long thick cloth ruffling on itself and some metal rings 
called the young raven haired to turn her head. The small opening in the 
curtains revealed her not so favorite senpai, not that she really had a 
favorite, with a sheepish grin.

&quot;Yo! Yaya-chan! Are you ok?!&quot;

Yaya nods emptily with her fake smile as her only reply. She wondered 
since when had Sei been calling her &quot;-chan&quot; or since when had she let 
this woman call her with so much familiarity. But then again... it 
wasn&#39;t probably that she had let her but more likely because she just 
never took the time to say that she couldn&#39;t.

&quot;I see...&quot; said her blonde senpai as she opened the curtain wider for 
her to enter. She walks closer to her kouhai and...

&quot;Yaya!!!&quot; embraces her happily. &quot;I was so worried! I ran here from my 
class as soon as one of you my spy in your class mailed me and said that 
you fainted! But you were still a sleep and the doctor told me to come 
back later. Did you just wake up? It&#39;s lunch time.&quot;

For the second time today, the raven haired had to bear with her 
senpai&#39;s unnecessary concern. She let out a soft sigh and almost 
playfully pressed her fingers on the sides of Sei&#39;s stomach and wiggled 
them in an attempt to tickle the overly playful lady. And surprisingly 
it worked! Sei laughed and almost instantly leaped away from her kouhai, 
rubbing her sides in an attempt to relieve her of the surprised ticklish 
feeling.

&quot;Hahaha! I guess if you can come up with counterattacks, I can assume 
you&#39;re feeling alright then?&quot; said the blonde still with a big smile on 
her face, as her body tried to contain the laughter that Yaya had 
luckily let out.

&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m fine.&quot; The raven haired nodded and stood up from the bed 
with a short stretch.

&quot;That&#39;s good to know.&quot; Sei gave herself a pause and watched as Yaya 
stood, turned to her bag and checked its contents. &quot;By the way... why 
did you faint anyway?&quot;

Yaya stopped what she was doing and looked up to the ceiling. It was 
something that had become a habit to her when being asked things she was 
unsure how to answer. &quot;I don&#39;t know how to answer that...&quot; was her only 
reply.

&quot;What the hell is that suppose to mean?&quot; Sei stared at Yaya with a 
confused face, eyeing the other girl&#39;s sun amber eyes as they seemed to 
quiver... She had never heard Yaya answer like that. The girl had always 
something to say. If she didn&#39;t... she&#39;d say something anyway, anything 
to make someone think and lead their minds in circles at least until she 
actually had an answer. But it wasn&#39;t the case this time... And Sei 
found herself unsure of how to proceed. And then she wondered... &#39;do 
eyes quiver like that?&#39;

The raven haired only shrugged before turning back to Sei. She wasn&#39;t 
proud of it... but the blonde was the closest thing she had to a best 
friend now.

&quot;Wanna ditch classes?&quot; Yaya blandly asked.

&quot;Oh! Maria! Who are you and what have you done with Yaya-chan!?&quot; Sei 
asked, dramatically feigning over reaction as she pointed at the raven 
haired in an accusing way.

&quot;...&quot; Yaya raised a brow, clearly annoyed. &quot;... just because you dress 
suspicious doesn&#39;t mean you should act like it. Satou...&quot;

&#39;Oh crap! Must have been a really bad day already...&#39; The blonde yelled 
in her mind. The last time the raven haired had used her family name it 
was to say; &quot;I&#39;m not talking to you anymore.&quot; last year. It took her 
three months of flirting, following her everywhere, hugging, absolute 
clinginess and favors before the Yaya actually started talking to her 
again. And she had more sense not to mention she wasn&#39;t willing to go 
through that again.

She raised her hand behind her head and pretended to scratch herself as 
she grinned sheepishly as usual. &quot;Haha... Sorry. It was just so unlike 
you that I had to say that.&quot;

Sei was relieved when Yaya sighed and the look of annoyance on her face 
seemed to lower somewhat. &quot;So... were did you want to go?&quot; She asked 
her, thinking that maybe she&#39;ll talk when they find a more comfortable 
place.

&quot;To a Love Hotel.&quot; Yaya answered rather blankly.

Sei had heard her say that about a dozen times. And each time she was 
sure that she used it as a fake suggestion, maybe even a signal, to get 
her out of a certain situation... like ten girls wanting her to tutor 
them in English all at once or a party she doesn&#39;t want to stay in. It 
was a silly comment that gave birth to a rumor of them being a couple 
for about two months, but it had died down when someone actually 
followed them and they were never near a hotel district. But this 
time... She actually looked serious. And Sei hand only one reaction...

She placed her hand on the raven hair&#39;s forehead and checked her 
temperature. &quot;Hmmmm...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sick, Senpai. And I was joking... as always.&quot; Still with her 
blank face.

Sei then let out an exaggerated sigh of relief with a fake hint of 
disappointment. &quot;Ha... Too bad, but I guess it&#39;s good too... I&#39;m not 
skilled enough yet. I still have a hundred girls to feel and practice on 
before I think I&#39;ll ever be ready to touch Nanto Yaya-megami-sama&#39;s 
body!&quot; it was a lie and Yaya knew it, then again... she wasn&#39;t so sure, 
but she was willing to play along and let Sei believe what she wants her 
to at least for now.

&quot;You&#39;re such a pervert Senpai.&quot; Yaya tried to look a little disgusted.

As a response the blonde approached her closer and with her index finger 
traced Yaya&#39;s left cheek and said rather seductive; &quot;Anything for you! 
My love...&quot;

&quot;Okay... now, you&#39;re just being creepy...&quot; her eye brow twitched 
awkwardly as she looked at Sei&#39;s face.

&quot;Hehe! Sorry. Why don&#39;t I just get us some food? I&#39;ll get you that 
strawberry shake you like.&quot; Sei said as she gently pushed Yaya down to 
sit on the bed again. &quot;Get as much rest as you want. Since you&#39;re here 
already, why not make the best of it.&quot;

It wasn&#39;t a suggestion Yaya surmised but nodded as she quickly decided 
to be tempted by her offer, despite her small dislike to stay too long 
in the infirmary, and just laid back again. To which the blonde smiled 
at, feeling quite happy that the raven haired girl actually did what she 
asked her.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back in a bit.&quot; The taller girl immediately left, after telling 
the doctor she&#39;ll get her something too if she&#39;ll let them eat in the 
infirmary. But of course, the blonde didn&#39;t wait for the physician to 
actually answer her not that she would argue with Sei anymore.

Hikari was walking towards the infirmary when Sei had left. She wondered 
why the girl seemed like she was in a hurry, but after a few steps 
decided it wasn&#39;t something she had to worry about.

After a few minutes... the door opened again, and Yaya heard the soft 
foot steps that she quickly noticed were coming closer to her. She 
assumed it was Sei, the only time the girl was quiet was 1) when she was 
kissing someone, 2) when she&#39;s absolutely must be, 3) when she actually 
has nothing to say, which is very very rare, 4) when she&#39;s holding 
something with her mouth and 5) when she was trying to surprise her.

&quot;That was... quick...&quot; Yaya said as she sat up from the bed only to find 
herself face to face with a blonde girl... that was not who she had 
expected.

The raven hair&#39;s face paled a little, but Hikari didn&#39;t notice. She was 
quite nervous and she hasn&#39;t been like that in about two years. And 
though she didn&#39;t like it when she was nervous, she couldn&#39;t help but be 
glad she that was and to whom she was nervous about. She stood in front 
of her just like that as she tried to collect her thoughts and decide 
what to say or do. She wanted to be angry, she wanted answers, over a 
year of very close friendship... all ended without a real goodbye. She 
forced herself to grit her teeth, to make herself angrier than she 
actually was but then...

&quot;Hikari.&quot; The raven haired had called her name so softly, gently and 
with, to Hikari at least was, the most heartwarming smile. Hikari&#39;s 
angry mask broke instantly.

&quot;YAYA-CHAN!!!&quot; She rushed forward just dropping her bag and throwing 
herself at the raven haired girl with her eyes in tears she coiled her 
arms around the other girl. The force and speed led them down onto the 
bed, Yaya was only glad that her blonde friend&#39;s face was digging on her 
shoulder by now because it had take her a few seconds to wipe the 
surprised look she had on her face. The girl&#39;s embrace was incredibly 
tight and passionate... the kind one didn&#39;t expect to receive from a 
friend.

She hugged her old friend back, if at least to give the blonde girl a 
little comfort. There were quite a few questions in her mind now as 
well. But she decided not to ask them now. And something else was in her 
mind... Her chest didn&#39;t feel painful. In fact, she felt nothing... but 
Hikari on her herself which should have at least surprised her more. But 
she wasn&#39;t in fact it surprise had subsided and all she felt was 
happiness... happy that Hikari was here with her.

Then suddenly she felt surprised... she was surprised she was happy 
seeing Hikari. She then felt a little disappointed at herself... she had 
thought she was over the girl. But then again... she had barely seen and 
talked to her. Sure she fainted when she first confirmed it... but that 
was probably all from the surprise. She forced herself to believe that, 
telling herself in her mind as she patted head and back. A few moments 
passed by and the two old friends remained silent on the bed still in 
each other&#39;s arms.

&quot;How are you, Hikari?&quot; Yaya was really quite lost on what to say. She 
decided on pleasantries... anything to get a conversation started.

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She replied, as she slid her arms from underneath Yaya and 
held herself up so that she could be face to face with her long lost 
friend. &quot;I was very lonely when you left without a word... but I&#39;m fine 
now.&quot; She added with a sad smile.

Yaya allowed her hands to drop down on the bed when Hikari moved. She 
looked at Hikari, as the blonde looked at her. She found herself looking 
at each and everyone of her features; her eyes, nose, brows, hair, 
cheeks, ear, neck... trying to burn it all into her memory and trying to 
remember what the young lady in front of her looked like four and a half 
years ago.

The raven haired let out a soft and short giggle before she said; 
&quot;You&#39;re not as cute as you used to be.&quot;

Hikari was surprised at first before she frowned, she felt a little 
hurt, that this coming from Yaya who always complemented her for being 
cute, it didn&#39;t sound to her that what would follow would be. But 
fortunately for her she thought wrong.

&quot;You&#39;ve grown quite beautiful Hikari.&quot; Yaya followed, with a soft 
smile... that Hikari had only seen once before.

Hikari blushed, in a way that only Yaya could. She never understood why 
she blushed like that whenever Yaya complemented her looks. Not even 
Amane could get her to blush and feel the way she did now. She thought 
it was odd... and here years of not seeing each other, Yaya could still 
make her do it. &quot;You&#39;re still quite cheeky aren&#39;t you? Yaya-chan.&quot;

Yaya could only smile. That might be true once in a while... but 
compared to their high school days, she&#39;s been very tame. That is if no 
one placed Sei in the picture.

A falsely hoarse voice said; &quot;Ahem.&quot; called the attention of the two 
young ladies on the bed. Both snap their heads to the direction of the 
voice and realized that a tall blonde girl with short hair was standing 
near the curtain&#39;s opening as she held a plastic of food and drinks.

&quot;Ah! Sei-senpai...&quot; called the raven haired. She noticed that Sei looked 
rather annoyed for some reason but decided to not mention it.

Hikari recognized the blonde as the same young woman that rushed out of 
the infirmary just moments ago. She didn&#39;t know why... but she gave this 
feeling that she didn&#39;t like her.

She turns back to Hikari and notices that the girl was still practically 
on top of her. &quot;Um... Hikari?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Hikari turns her head back to face Yaya.

&quot;You can sit up now.&quot; Yaya suggested with a small smile.

&quot;OH!&quot; Hikari then noticed what a compromising position they shared, 
blushed a few shades of red harder before she flopped herself to the 
side and seated herself more than half a foot from Yaya on the same bed. 
&quot;Sorry...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot; The raven haired sat up and fixed the wrinkles of her 
clothes.

Sei looked confused at the exchange. She had known Yaya for almost a 
year and there has never been a girl that had gotten that close to the 
raven haired other than herself. Even more confused since Yaya didn&#39;t 
seem to mind being so close to this girl.

&quot;Sei-senpai, let me introduce you.&quot; Yaya said as she gestured her hand 
towards Hikari. &quot;This is my best friend from my high school days back in 
Spica. Konohana Hikari.&quot;

Hikari bowed to her politely towards the taller blonde girl and decided 
not to say anything for now.

Then Yaya gestured her hand towards Sei. &quot;Hikari, this is Satou 
Sei-senpai.&quot;

Sei also bows and to Yaya&#39;s surprise, didn&#39;t say anything.

&quot;Is something wrong senpai?&quot; Yaya asked in a soft voice.

Sei snaps out of her thoughts and turns to Yaya. &quot;No! Nothing really...&quot; 
She paused and thought of what to do. She then remembered that she had 
bought food.

&quot;Oh yeah... Here!&quot; Sei dug into the plastic and handed Yaya a sandwich 
meal and the strawberry shake.

Yaya thanked her senpai for the food, before she even considered to open 
her food she turns towards Hikari and asked; &quot;Have you had lunch yet 
Hikari?&quot;

The smaller blonde shakes her head and stands to pick up her bag.

&quot;If you like we can share this.&quot; Yaya offered her best friend.

Sei took that a chance to rid them of the new comer&#39;s company and 
immediately said; &quot;No! You should let her get one herself! You fainted 
remember? You need your lunch!&quot;

Hikari by chance had looked at their senpai, she looked awfully and 
obviously jealous for some reason adding that statement just now... told 
her that she didn&#39;t like her being here.

&quot;It&#39;s ok. I have already bought something this morning for lunch.&quot; Yaya 
nods in acknowledgement before turning her attention to Sei, who looked 
a little out of character and clearly disappointed about something.

&quot;Sei-senpai?&quot; she called her.

The tall blonde was eyeing the other rather annoyed that the girl was 
prepared.

&quot;Senpai!&quot; Yaya called again, this time Sei snaps to attention. &quot;Yeah?!&quot; 
she called out nearly panicking.

Yaya just tapped the empty space of the bed right beside her, as she 
assumed that Sei wouldn&#39;t settle for anywhere else.

Sei nodded and quickly sat herself beside the raven haired, only she sat 
right beside her not bothering to keep even the smallest of distance 
between them. She noticed that Yaya looked at where their clothes 
touched and though she didn&#39;t seem to like the close contact she didn&#39;t 
say anything or move away either. It made her wonder &#39;why...&#39;

They all ate in silence most of the time, the three would then and again 
break into conversation. And it was almost amusing to Yaya that the two 
blondes seemed to be asking about the other girl through her instead of 
asking one another directly. Some of which included were; &#39;Where did 
they meet each other and how?&#39;, &#39;How close were they?&#39; and &#39;How long 
have they known each other?&#39; were the questions that Hikari had won, at 
least in Sei&#39;s mind she did.

She was jealous... except that she didn&#39;t quite know why.

Yaya hand finished her sandwich and was about to take a sip of her shake 
when she noticed that Sei silent. &quot;Sei-senpai are you ok?&quot;

Sei looks at the raven haired and wasn&#39;t surprised that there was still 
not a trace of care in her face. There never was. &quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot; She 
mumbled and looked away for a bit.

&#39;She&#39;s going to say... Kiss me maybe I&#39;ll feel better.&#39; The raven haired 
thought to herself, almost betting that the taller blonde would say 
those words or something similar in a few short moments. And they did!

&quot;Kiss me so I can feel better! Yaya-chan!&quot; Sei said as she quickly 
turned towards Yaya again and wrapped her arms around the raven haired, 
her lips poised for a kiss.

Yaya didn&#39;t struggle, surprised that she had not thought of whether to 
evade or to deflect Sei&#39;s advances earlier. And Hikari too was surprised 
by the scene, she was also beginning to think that Sei liked Yaya.

&quot;Are you stupid? Why should I?!&quot; Yaya yelled out to the blonde as she 
tried to push her away from her face. She had finally decided to not 
kiss her like she always have, but she did wonder why she too so long to 
decide.

&quot;Aww come on! One little kiss! We&#39;re friends aren&#39;t we?&quot; Sei said with 
her lips still puckered asking to be kissed.

Hikari then decided to test a theory. What it was exactly didn&#39;t form 
well enough in her mind... just that it has something to do with who 
Yaya will kiss and or what Yaya would say. &quot;Oh! If friends can kiss then 
I should get one too Yaya-chan!&quot;

&quot;EH?!!&quot; Yaya was almost completely shocked by that. But glad that Sei 
was squirming so much that it kept her from even considering fainting as 
an option.

And almost immediately Hikari felt a glare coming from their senpai. She 
looked at the other blonde and returned her glare in kind. They began to 
argue and even used words that the raven haired wouldn&#39;t consider adding 
to her vocabulary anytime soon. Yaya looked at the two blondes she 
believed that Sei was joking, however she wasn&#39;t quite sure why Hikari 
wanted a kiss... nor was she sure why the two of them didn&#39;t seem to get 
quite along. But one thing was for sure... she wasn&#39;t about to kiss 
either. An idea pops into her mind and she quickly rolls with it.

Pushing the two girls away from her and each other, stands and tells 
them; &quot;Alright! Stop! I&#39;ll kiss you both.&quot;

&quot;Really?!&quot; The two quickly react almost at the same time.

The raven haired nods but adds; &quot;But first! Please close your eyes.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Ask Sei rather cheekily.

&quot;It would be embarrassing otherwise.&quot; Yaya said as she feigned 
embarrassment. She wasn&#39;t a member of the drama club in her highschool 
for nothing.

Oddly the two blondes look at each other before looking away as if the 
other was the most repulsive thing they&#39;ve ever seen and nodded at 
Yaya&#39;s request. They both closed their eyes and readied themselves for 
Yaya&#39;s kiss.

In Sei&#39;s mind, she was knew that she was joking at first... but when the 
other girl said that she wanted a kiss too she just lost herself and 
started attacking the girl with words and her eyes. She wanted to win, 
sure this girl had known Yaya longer... but she wanted to be the one 
closer to her. She thought it unlike her, she had never liked anyone so 
much to act this way. She then noted she had to call Yumi or Sachiko 
later... or maybe even Shimako can help her out a little.

To Hikari, she had meant that as a joke, to satisfy a curiosity and 
maybe to tease the blonde senpai. But she also felt that she didn&#39;t want 
to loose... if Yaya was going to kiss Sei she better kiss her too. It 
was an odd feeling, she never thought she&#39;d want a kiss from Yaya. But 
recalling the one time Yaya did kiss her, even though it was on the 
forehead... it felt nice.

Yaya on the other hand... hand no intention of kissing either. She 
quietly and stealthily picks up her bag, walks away from the bed the two 
were sitting on and headed for the door which she quickly opens and 
dashes out of.

When the two girls heard the door open, they of course realized that 
they had been tricked and quickly gathered up their things to chase 
after the raven haired girl.

&quot;YAYA-CHAN!!!&quot;

&quot;WAIT!!!&quot;

But they soon lost sight of her when she turned at a corner. Sei quickly 
gave up, knowing that Yaya was faster than her and she surprised herself 
when she advised Hikari to do the same.</pre>
