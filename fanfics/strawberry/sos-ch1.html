<h1>S.O.S. (Save Our School) (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Today was a very special day for the students of the Strawberry Dorms. 
The students from all three affiliated schools (St. Miator&#39;s Girl&#39;s 
Academy, St. Spica&#39;s Girl&#39;s Institute, and of course St. Lulim&#39;s Girl&#39;s 
School) were all gathered outside together out in the front of the large 
Catholic Church on campus. The announcement of the large gathering by 
the head Sister in charge of the school came as a surprise to all the 
students. None more so than the student council presidents of the three 
schools.

&quot;Where is Etoile-sama?&quot; Rokujou-sama, council president of Miator, 
asked.

&quot;Are you really surprised?&quot; Spica&#39;s council president Toumori-sama 
asked, &quot;Shizuma is always absent lately. That&#39;s what we get for having 
an Etoile from Miator.&quot;

&quot;And so it begins,&quot; Chikaru-sama, council president of St. Lulim quipped 
as the other two presidents began to bicker.


As the students looked around questioningly, the head Sister finally 
appeared and stood before the collected students behind a hastily set up 
podium.

&quot;Young ladies,&quot; she said rather sadly, &quot;I&#39;m afraid I have rather 
distressing news. As you know, the three girl&#39;s schools here are all 
under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Okinawa. Sadly, due to diocesan 
budget cuts (not to mention several lawsuits), the decision has been 
made by the diocese to close the schools.&quot;

Shock immediately filled the collected assembly. Cries of &quot;No!&quot; and 
&quot;Mary help us!&quot; were heard over tearful words exchanged between the 
students.

&quot;And now,&quot; the Sister said, her voice barely audible above the 
collective chatter, &quot;Here to discuss this further is the diocesan 
representative, Sister Mary Elephant,&quot; she said as an extremely plump 
older nun in a full habit came to the podium.

&quot;Ladies, I...&quot; the Sister began, only to be ignored by the students, 
&quot;Um, girls,&quot; she said a little louder, but still was unable to get 
anyone to listen. She frowned as she took in a big breath of air and 
yelled into the microphone.

&quot;QUIET!&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said pleasantly as everyone&#39;s attention was now focused 
on her, &quot;I realize this comes as a bit of a shock to all of you, but 
unfortunately  the diocese is hurting. This was a hard decision, but 
with the guidance of the Virgin Mary, the Holy Ghost, Saint Lulim, 
patron saint of Japanese fish-scalers, Saint Miator, patron saint of 
leaf blowers, and Saint Spica, patron saint of sanitary tissues who 
bravely died a martyr&#39;s death so that her fellow nuns might have proper 
feminine hygiene products, the Bishop has made what he felt the was the 
best choice. Saint Seiya&#39;s school for overly-active boys will remain 
open however, as will Saint Tail&#39;s academy for troubled girls.&quot;

Nagisa Aoi turned questioningly to her friend Tamao Suzumi, &quot;Tamao-chan, 
our school is named after the patron saint of leaf blowers?&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Tamao said with a nod, &quot;He died while raking the grounds of the 
Franciscan Friary he was in.&quot;

&quot;Really? How?&quot;

&quot;He fell out of the tree,&quot; Tamao explained, quickly adding &quot;He wasn&#39;t 
the brightest of saints,&quot; the sound of weeping behind them alerted them 
to the presence of someone. They both turned around to see their room 
temp Chiyo Tsukidate crying.

&quot;No,&quot; she wept bitterly, &quot;I don&#39;t want to leave this school, I... I...&quot; 
she was cut off as Nagisa and Tamao pulled her into an affectionate hug.

Elsewhere, among the students of St. Spica&#39;s, others were weeping.

Hikari Konohana was beside herself. Her friend Yaya Nanto held her tight 
as the blonde wept.

&quot;Our chorus,&quot; Hikari wept, &quot;I wanted so much to sing at least once more 
for Amane-sempai, and now...&quot;

As the two friends clung sorrowfully to each other, the younger 
first-year student Tsubomi Okuwaka likewise wiped away a tear.

&quot;The closing will not take place for at least another month or two,&quot; 
Sister Mary said, &quot;Giving your parents some time to find new schools for 
you. From what the Head Sister has told me, there&#39;s a secular private 
school not far from here known as Ohtori Academy you might wish to talk 
to your folks about.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Nagisa groaned, &quot;Not Ohtori! That&#39;s the school I transferred 
from.&quot;

&quot;Is it bad?&quot; Tamao asked.

Nagisa nodded vigorously, adding, &quot;They&#39;re all a bunch of kooks up 
there!&quot;

As Sister Mary Elephant finished and the stunned students began to 
disperse, the student council presidents stayed behind.

&quot;They can&#39;t do this!&quot; Chikaru said, &quot;They... They just can&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;They can and they are,&quot; Toumori said as she defeatedly looked down at 
her hands.

&quot;No,&quot; Rokujou said, a determined look in her eyes, &quot;If there&#39;s one thing 
I&#39;ve learned from attending St. Miator&#39;s Academy, besides just how many 
lesbians can hide in an all-girl Catholic school, it&#39;s that you should 
never give up, no matter what!&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Chikaru asked hopefully.

&quot;I mean that the three of us, as well as some of our fellow students, 
have to go to the diocesan headquarters and plead our case to the Bishop 
directly!&quot;

&quot;Great idea,&quot; Toumori said, &quot;But without the Etoile with us, I doubt the 
Bishop will listen.&quot;

&quot;And how are we going to find her?&quot; Chikaru asked, &quot;I mean you know 
Shizuma; if she doesn&#39;t want to be found, she won&#39;t be.&quot;

Rokuja was about to say something when she saw three fellow Miator 
students passing by...

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I cried so much,&quot; Chiyo said as Nagisa wiped the younger 
girl&#39;s tears with a handkerchief.

&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; the redhead reassured her, &quot;We&#39;re all feeling pretty 
down about this.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tamao said, &quot;We...&quot;

&quot;You!&quot; a voice shouted. The three girls turned around, only to see the 
three student council presidents running up to them.

&quot;Rokuja-sempai,&quot; Nagisa stuttered out nervously, &quot;We were just...&quot;

&quot;Nagisa-san,&quot; Rokuja said, &quot;How would you like to help save our three 
schools?&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Nagisa asked, blushing cutely as her eyes widened, &quot;But... How 
can I help?&quot;

&quot;Good question,&quot; Toumori quipped, &quot;How&#39;s she supposed to help?&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; Rokuja explained, &quot;For some reason Shizuma seeks her out like 
a bee looking for nectar. All we have to do is stay close to her and 
eventually...&quot;

&quot;Eventually?&quot; Chikaru asked, &quot;We don&#39;t have time for eventually, we... 
Wait a second,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;I think I have a plan...&quot;

-A Short Time Later-

&quot;Hold still,&quot; Chikaru ordered as she tied the fishing line around 
Nagisa&#39;s waist.

&quot;But I still don&#39;t understand how this is going to help save the 
school,&quot; Nagisa said as St. Lulim&#39;s school&#39;s president finished tying 
the string. It ran from around her waist to a fishing pole the council 
president was holding.

&quot;That makes two of us,&quot; Spica president Toumori said skeptically.

&quot;Make that three,&quot; Rokuja added.

&quot;Oh ye of little faith,&quot; Chikaru said as she took out a magic marker and 
hurriedly wrote something on a small piece of cardboard. &quot;Here,&quot; she 
said as she handed it to Nagisa, &quot;Hold this.&quot;

Tamao went over to her friend and read the card.

&quot;Bait,&quot; she read aloud, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Chikaru said with a smile, &quot;Now Nagisa-san, just stand 
here in the hallway and try to look as sweet and innocent as possible,&quot; 
she ordered as she and the others quickly ran around the corner. Once 
safely hid, the St. Lulim council president crouched down holding 
tightly onto the fishing pole.&quot;

&quot;Chikaru-sempai,&quot; Chiyo said, &quot;Will Nagisa-sama be alright?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll be fine,&quot; the older student reassured, &quot;Now keep quiet or we&#39;ll 
never get a bite.&quot;

Several tense minutes later, Chikaru felt a tug on the line.

&quot;Bingo!&quot; she said triumphantly as she started reeling it in, &quot;Umph! Give 
me a hand!&quot; she ordered. The others quickly came forward to help her 
pull the line. Soon enough Nagisa was pulled around the corner, with 
Shizuma holding tightly onto the blushing student.

&quot;Huh?&quot; The Etoile asked as she saw the others, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;The diocese is closing down the schools!&quot; Chikaru exclaimed.

&quot;What?&quot; Shizuma asked, her normally cool demeanor forgotten as she 
processed the information.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Toumori added, &quot;And we need your help!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to try to sneak off the school grounds to see the Bishop,&quot; 
Rokuja explained, &quot;And we need you to come with us.&quot;

Shizuma stared blankly at the three presidents before finally looking 
back down at the younger girl she was still holding, &quot;Will little 
Nagisa-chan be coming too?&quot; she asked, a predatory look in her eyes.

Rokuja sighed, &quot;We weren&#39;t decided yet on which school representatives 
would be joining us, but if it&#39;ll get you to come along...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m coming too!&quot; Tamao said, feelings of jealousy welling up within her 
at the sight of Nagisa&#39;s head being crushed into the Etoile&#39;s bosom.

&quot;If you two are going, I should go too,&quot; their room temp Chiyo said.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Tomouri said, &quot;It looks like the St. Miator group has been 
decided upon. I&#39;ll come up with a group of students from St. Spica and 
Chikaru will pick the girls to represent St. Lulim. We&#39;ll all meet back 
here in an hour.&quot;

&quot;All of us,&quot; Rokuja said in a dangerously low voice as she focused in on 
Shizuma, &quot;You understand?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the Etoile said as she finally let go of Nagisa. The 
redhead promptly fainted backwards into Tamao and Chiyo&#39;s arms.

&quot;Right,&quot; Tomouri said, &quot;See you in an hour.&quot;

With that, the girls separated.
