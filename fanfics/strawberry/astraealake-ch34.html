<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Light like snow and fluffy like cotton candy... it's time for a soft chapter. But I tried to put in a few chewy bits, as well.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I feel a little cheated, strangely enough.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  scratched her nose. “You know, I know exactly what you mean… it’s not  like I’m not grateful, but at the end of the day it feels like I’ve  just contracted another debt to that miserable bastard.”<br />
  Kaname rolled her eyes. “I was joking. Hey, don’t be so gloomy! This is  still brilliant!” She threw herself forwards like a blue-haired  ballistic missile, wrapping her arms round Momomi’s waist. “We win, we  win, we win!” She lifted a struggling Momomi up and whirled her round  and round. “I told you, didn’t I? Never say die! People like us never  lose!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  tried not to blush and fought hard to get her legs back on solid  ground. Of course, she lost; Kaname was far taller and far stronger.  “Stop it! You’re making me dizzy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you’re spoiling the  moment!” Kaname replied, grinning inanely. “We’ve been waiting like a  month for this, you know, and it wasn’t the easiest month. But good  things happen to bad people, and we’re here after all! Right now I feel  like running twenty marathons, then bashing in your father by the way  of thanks! I have way too much energy right now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed,  stopping herself from fighting and hugging Kaname tightly. Then she  drew back and stared at her with amused eyes. “So, what happened to the  old Kaname Kenjou, who was always so cool and apathetic and didn’t get  emotional about anything at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Who the hell is that? Never  heard of her,” Kaname deadpanned. “Well, screw her, that’s what I say.  I’m way too psyched up to listen to any staid dingbat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“God, you’re more excited than me. A kid before Christmas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  isn’t that the way?” Kaname said, smiling back. “I mean, you still have  to worry about your freaky weird deceptive bastard father and this and  that… I just have to enjoy the fact that he’ll be separated from us by  several thousand miles of sea soon enough, but we’ll be here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How  about if we start acting like the Etoiles?” Momomi teased. “You’d have  to visit my parents in summer and be very polite and genteel despite  their hostility. How about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not really my style,” Kaname  said. “By and large, I prefer to pretend that I was a project of virgin  birth, or that I sprang to life fully formed in the dark, dank crypts  of Astraea Hill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sadly, that defence doesn’t hold up in a court of law. Even if you say it’s your religion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Too bad. Shall we finally have some breakfast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi glanced at her watch. “You mean an early lunch? No, a fairly late lunch actually… my, my.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Whatever,  I just need to shovel food into me before I drop dead. Being excited  requires lots of energy. At this rate my body will start to cannibalise  itself and all my hair will fall out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smirked. “That happens anyway, you know. I get blue hairs all over my bed whenever you sit on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And no doubt you collect them and are planning to put them in a silver locket to treasure forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi scratched her chin. “I have a distinct feeling that I’m being mocked.” <em>She’s using those lines far more often now…well, this is Kaname. Don’t take it too seriously. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Besides, for all your big talk, you’re no better,” Kaname remarked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Soon  we’ll be able to swap lockets,” Momomi remarking, poking her friend on  the chin. “Until then, I’ll feed you in the vague hope that it will  shut you up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They set off, heading for the canteen. Momomi  scratched her nose, wondering where to take the conversation next. “Oh…  before I forget… I want to thank you, Kaname. There’s no way I would  have been able to do it without you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not a problem.  Remember, I’m always following my own selfish agenda, right?” Kaname  grinned. “It’s just that occasionally we’re going in the same  direction. The only pity is we didn’t really get to show a rich bastard  where he gets off, as he said it himself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, to be fair, I did shout at him rather a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  nodded. “I suppose that counts. No, that also reminds me…” She slapped  her fist into her hand. “And here I was almost forgetting. Your family  leaves tomorrow morning, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded uncertainly. “That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Excellent. I still have plenty of time left to take care of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re not planning on lurking in a dark place and stabbing him with Kariya’s katana or something weird like that, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  worry, I’m not planning anything I’ll be sent to jail for,” Kaname  assured her. “Probably. Considering this was about us being together,  that would be a little counter-productive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Being together, huh? </em>“And  that’s another thing I need to thank you for. Without you, I wouldn’t  have any inclination to stay, either. But because you were here with  me, I had a reason to fight, and I’ve discovered a lot of interesting  things. So, truly, thank you, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rubbed the back of  her head awkwardly. “Hey… I’m no good with this sincerity… but that’s  to say, I should think to. Considering how much you need me to protect  you, I should damn well think you’d be grateful!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled.  “Sorry, but it looks like I’ll be looking after you for a while longer  after all. So you won’t be able to sleep in the mornings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. I got it, already. Don’t mess up my hair too badly, alright?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It can’t get much worse than it’s natural state anyway, so don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, and thanks too,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled. “Oh? Sorry, but I didn’t catch that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thanks  for making my life interesting, too.” Kaname gave her a warning glance.  “I won’t say it a third time, so don’t push your luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re as bashful as ever,” Momomi teased. “Does it hurt so much to admit that the big, tough Kaname needs me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked away, blushing. “Don’t be ridiculous… you shouldn’t overestimate yourself, you know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kiyashiki-san! Kiyashiki-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi turned to see an excited Shion running towards them. “What in the world-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  heard! You did it!” Shion jumped onto her, hugging her energetically  then stepping back just as fast as she’d come. “Congratulations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ugh… this isn’t so good… all my friends are acting weird.” Momomi rubbed her face. “If Olesa hugs me, I’ll scream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked at her senpai thoughtfully. “Forget that. What I’m scared about is how fast this little stalker knew about this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked then gave Shion a very dirty look. “You were hiding in the lake, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion blinked politely. “Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“With  a little bamboo pipe for breathing, just drifting along beneath the  surface of water, where you could overhear the conversation. That’s the  only way you could know so fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname nodded. “That makes  sense… my other explanations all involved Shion being literally  omniscient or able to gather data through mobile phones using a psychic  power.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Let’s not get too silly, Kaname,” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  sorry to disappoint you,” Shion said, smiling brightly. “But it turns  out that I met your father when he was walking back from something, and  thought to plead your case. He told me rather gruffly that you could  stay here, <em>where you can rot for all I care, </em>I think it was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “I don’t buy that explanation. That just seems implausible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion laughed. “I feel like I really am disappointing you… perhaps I should start acting for you. I could start a cult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No need,” Momomi said quickly. “You’re overbearingly <em>you </em>even when you’re not trying. I don’t think I could take it if you acted even more strangely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even  in victory, you’re far from gracious, Kiyashiki-san,” Shion chided.  “Here I am, a faithful ally, and not a word of thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, as it turned out, not much of that stuff was very useful,” Kaname replied. “Only the really vital people get thanked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So thank you, Shion-senpai.” Momomi smiled. “Just to make sure Kaname doesn’t get too up herself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You really are as uncharitable as ever…” Kaname grumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  you’re welcome, as you owe me. Now, tell me your secret,” Shion said,  leaning towards Momomi with excited eyes. “How did you bend that  tenacious and stubborn man to your will? Were you so obnoxiously  offensive he simply couldn’t bear you thought of having you in the  house? Did you get down on your knees and beg, with womanly tears? Did  you blackmail him with the wealth of dirt you must know about him?” She  frowned. “Actually, he’s a bit hard to blackmail, by all accounts.  Rodrigo Phareli is not a man who cares about such things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I can’t tell you. It’s a trade secret.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, come on. I demand you tell all. I want these weaknesses to go in my new file on him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve started a file on him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’ll drop a hint,” Kaname offered. “It was mostly the obnoxiously offensive thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah,  I thought that might have been it.” Shion smiled. “You don’t look it,  Kiyashiki-san, but I can see how a forthright girl like you might have  an easy time offending a man like him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’s just the ancient attitudes he holds, which makes it easy,” Momomi bluffed. <em>Well, this way sounds more impressive than what actually occurred. Besides, it’s not entirely inaccurate. </em>“He’s practically pre-Victorian on a lot of things, so all it takes is enough guts to cut past his bluster.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm.  All the same, he strikes me as a man who prefers a direct approach to  dealing with such things. To a man of his pride, isn’t this just  running away?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’ve no idea how he sees it.” Momomi  shrugged. “If he considers it running away, that suits me just fine.  I’m happy to be left alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname cut in before Shion could say  anything else. “In any case, we were going to gab some lunch. I didn’t  get breakfast, so I’m hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion made tutting noises.  “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, you know. I’m  surprised you let her skip it, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know it’s bad,” Momomi replied. “But it was a case of the measures required in desperate times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey, don’t talk about me as if I’m her husband,” Kaname said sharply. “No, come to that, don’t talk about me as I’m not there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, I said I’d treat you before. Now appears to be a very appropriate time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Are you sure?” Momomi asked. “I certainly don’t intend to contract a new debt straight away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  on me,” Shion replied. She smiled. “Don’t worry, those who are  well-informed can make a very good living out of it. I don’t want for  anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then feel free to teach me the art of turning  stalker-like behaviour into gold.” Kaname adjusted her blazer  thoughtfully. “That’s modern-day alchemy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sadly, you don’t have  the necessary… how do I put this… Kenjou-kun’s direct and  uncompromisingly honest personality is probably better suited to a  different vocation.” Shion cocked her head and smiled again, receiving  a slightly cynical look in return. “In any case, it will be my treat.  And the term is journalism, not stalking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Same difference, right?” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi shook her head. “We’ve been over this, Kaname, there’s a huge difference.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thank you, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Journalists get paid to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  sighed. “You should thank God that you have such a kindly senpai. Most  of my contemporaries would have told you off and ignored you a long  time ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed. “You know you like it really. Why  fight it? You don’t strike me as the type who wants us to speak  respectfully and bow a lot anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so. That’s why  I’ve no time for Miator’s outdated systems, though.” Shion ran a hand  through her blonde hair. “Seniority means next to nothing, we should  judge people by merit and results, not age or manners. That’s what  counts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll second that, forehead-senpai,” Kaname said enthusiastically. “One of the most sensible things you’ve ever said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  faked an exhausted sigh again, looking up the heavens as if asking what  she’d done to deserve this. “Well, your support for that motion isn’t  very encouraging, Kenjou-kun. If we are to be judged by manners, you’d  be in an extremely difficult situation, and you know it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  walked into the canteen. Shion grinned, putting her hands on their  shoulders. “Now, you two just sit down. I’ll get your lunches. Oh, and  don’t mope in the corner this time, either. Go and sit with Olesa and  Amiki, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned. “You’re pretty scary when you’re  being generous, though. It’s like an estate agent or a loan shark or  something. They may be very nice now, but you just know that they’ll be  different before long.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion flicked her on the forehead. “One  day I’ll find a way to do you two a favour without you insulting me.  Now, go and sit down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Okay, okay.” Momomi walked away. “Well, how sinister can free food be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Pretty  much,” Kaname admitted. “I have a knack for these things, but even I’m  having difficulty thinking of a trap less conclusive than poison.  Presuming she’s not yet that far up the criminal food chain, we should  be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded distractedly, looking dubiously at Olesa  and Amiki’s table. For a moment she was inclined to walk on by, but  then she remembered her own promise to get through to her rival. So she  stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa looked up. Insofar as her face ever showed any emotion, she was a little surprised. “Hi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, it’s the lovebirds again,” Amiki noted, folding her arms. “What do you guys want now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tips from a more mature couple, of course,” Momomi quipped, ignoring Kaname’s glare. “Can we sit down?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  wouldn’t be proper to stop you.” Olesa sounded as if she vaguely  resented that fact, but that was the closest she ever got to an  emphatic yes anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sat opposite Olesa, with Kaname next  to her. She stared at Olesa for a second, then reached into her blazer  and pulled out her phone. She flipped it between her hands for a  second, then placed it on the table without saying a word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa narrowed her eyes. “So it’s finished?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s finished. And I’m cutting you loose, even though you didn’t actually do anything.” Momomi looked closely at her rival. <em>I  wonder, should I have taken that fact as a bad excuse to continue like  this? It probably wouldn’t work anyway, but it would be annoying if she  just walked away.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa nodded, disputing neither fact. “Of  course, after all this time I don’t feel particularly threatened  myself. The Etoiles really did know anyway.” She took out her own phone  and put it down as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They slid their phones across the table,  taking each other’s without a word. Momomi searched through, locating  her recorded conversation on the nature of rivals and another on their  original deal brokering. With that done, she put the mobile down,  resisting the temptation to ferret through and look for other  interesting things. <em>From the look of it, mind, she doesn’t get much use out of it anyway. As if I’m not the same.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa frowned. “Where is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm?” Momomi smiled slightly. “Where’s what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The  record of my conversation with you, when I ordered Amiki to hurt you,”  Olesa elaborated. “Where is it? Did you delete it already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  that?” Momomi rubbed the back of her head in mock embarrassment. “I  never did have a recording of that, you know. It’s really very hard to  operate a phone blind unless you’ve practised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You mean to say there’s no recording because you screwed up?” Olesa asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Pretty much. I was bluffing.” Momomi frowned again, wondering how her rival would take it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa said nothing for a few moments, her face stiff, eyes still staring at the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki looked worriedly at her. “Ojou-sama…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Something  snapped, and Olesa laughed. Actually, it was more of a giggle, and even  though she put a hand over her mouth and smothered it quickly it was  still there. It was the kind of sound that echoed, even without echoes.  “As expected of an idiot like you, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah,” Momomi replied, biting back any retaliation. <em>Best not to push her too far. Besides…Olesa laughing? Olesa calling me Momomi? Olesa being a graceful loser? Olesa laughing?!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So that’s a completed matter. For better or for worse.” Olesa pushed Momomi’s phone back to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Right.” Momomi picked up Olesa’s phone, holding it out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Her rival hesitated for a moment, then took it from her outstretched hand. “It was… interesting, doing business with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Likewise.” Momomi looked at Shion queuing up and scowled. <em>So it’s like that, is it?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course, we still have a play to write. I’ve only known Tomori-senpai through you, but she is very difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You do know that your involvement in that was guaranteed by my blackmail?” Momomi wasn’t sure why she said that. <em>Probably just to push things along. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  am not the kind of person who will leave a task I have begun  unfinished,” Olesa replied. “Least of all to put it in your hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Man,  it’s always a blast to watch you two,” Kaname remarked. “It’s like  table tennis or something. First one way, then the other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  hardly one to talk.” Amiki rolled her eyes. “You two lovebirds don’t do  anything but that, because you’re so dishonest and hypocritical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “So, doubles now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“With you around, it’s mixed doubles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Olesa.”  Momomi looked steadily at her rival, who gazed back just as evenly.  “I’d almost forgotten, but I have something important to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then say it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  told me, a while ago, about who you are and what you intend for  yourself. Well, I’ve been thinking about that.” Momomi flicked a strand  of hair out of her eyes. “And I’ve decided, your attitude is all wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, really?” Olesa kept her voice light, but there was a hint of cold there that had been absent before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  going to sacrifice yourself to fulfil your mother’s expectations, and  make her happy. That’s a stupid way to live.” Momomi leaned forwards.  “It’s something I learned from a good friend, but there’s no point in  that. If you’re playing, play to win. Take everything. You should be  your own person, marry whoever you please and still come through.  That’s what I expect of anyone who wants to call themselves my rival.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa stared at her for a moment. “You have an endlessly optimistic attitude, don’t you? It’s very naïve.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  perhaps that is naivety, but I prefer it to cynicism. It’s hard to  respect someone who martyrs themselves without even struggling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa shrugged. “Well, it’s not really your business how I live my life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just think about it. That’s all I ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s all I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  back!” Shion said effusively. “Here, my treat!” She put two bentos on  the table, one for each of the two girls. They opened them and stared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sushizume and Hinomaru,” Olesa said, raising her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi glared at the box packed full of sushi, then she turned her gaze to Shion. “I suppose you find this amusing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm… just a little,” Shion admitted, sitting down and opening her own lunch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname,  on the other hand, had picked up her chopsticks and was obsessively  prodding one of the umeboshi. “Nothing but umeboshi and plain rice…  people eat these? How depressing. Life feels very futile right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  don’t be a drama queen.” Momomi swapped their boxes round, picking up  her chopsticks and grabbing some rice. She glared at Shion again before  tucking in. “So much for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion sighed theatrically and put  a hand over one eye, the way she did. “Oh, dear. My beautiful plan to  have you two feed each other all lunchtime has been unravelled. You’ve  got no sense of romance in you at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, dream on,” Kaname  snapped, picking up a piece of fish. “If you think we’d do something  like that for your convenience, you aren’t so good at data gathering  after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed deeply, fussing over the rice with her chopsticks. <em>Why  does everyone tease us like that? Is it simply the done thing in  Astraea Hill? Or am I that easy to read? I mean, Amiki has always been  Amiki, but Shion as well…it’s a little worrying. Especially as there’s  a chance that if people say it enough, Kaname would take it seriously,  and realise. I don’t want that to happen.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a little  ironic, when you tease me all the time, but you can’t handle it very  well in reverse,” Shion said thoughtfully. “Well, both of you have  bentos entirely to your tastes now, and that’s an improvement on the  usual. I’ll buy you ice cream afterwards, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For us, too,” Amiki insisted. “We contributed about as much as you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright,  alright. I guess I’ll let you take advantage of me, because I’m such a  generous upperclassman,” Shion replied, closing her eyes and shrugging  her shoulders. “You should be thankful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi rolled her eyes,  tapping her free hand on the table. “You do enjoy being a senpai…  anyway, that reminds me. I’ve won, so you need to go and meet up with  that Isae of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion folded her arms and cocked her head.  “Not yet. You still have to pass the scholarship exams, you know. Then  I’ll be obliged to hold up my part of the bargain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m halfway through, so you should at least phone her up or something,” Momomi replied. “Be fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa frowned. “Isae?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s nothing.” Shion got back to eating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When  I slept over in her room, I found out, she’s all mopey and a loner and  a stalker because of this girl Isae-chan,” Momomi explained. “She used  to be her roommate, and they got on really well, only Isae-chan had to  go to a foreign school far away or something, and they lost touch. So  Shion started sulking and became the unbalanced and slightly disturbed  individual she is today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I object to that. I’m not disturbed, just consciously different. I’m sure Kenjou-kun would say the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So poor Shion-senpai is lovesick?” Kaname asked. “Man, that explains so much…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re misinterpreting things in a consciously dramatic way.” Shion spoke with a slightly pained dignity, her eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Look, she’s going all defensive on us…” Momomi teased. “In any case, it’s a bet of ours. So phone her already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Have you any idea what international rates are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ten minutes ago you were telling us, and I quote, <em>I don’t want for anything</em>.”  Momomi looked at her senpai with amusement, delighted at how the usual  tables had turned. “So that excuse won’t cut it. Come on, you know you  want to really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, if you’re going to insist on it, I may  think about it. But I’m not making any promises. It’s not like she’ll  actually want to hear from me anyway…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t think like that,” Momomi said. “All you have to do is act sincerely in your feelings, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion gave her a loaded look. “Oh? Is that such an easy thing, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi winced, hearing her own words. “Yeah… I guess not…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  counted on her fingers. “Fear of rejection. Fear of misunderstanding.  Fear of changes for the worse, even wishing for changes for the better.  Fear of coming across as too desperate, too friendless, too obsessive.  There’s many reasons why life isn’t so simple as all that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  stop making excuses,” Kaname sighed. “It sounds like you want to be  forced. I’ll stand there and push you, if that’s what it takes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  I expect a full report afterwards, so I know you haven’t chickened  out,” Momomi said quickly. “It’s not enough to pretend and make up some  vague things. I’ll want to hear every last detail. It’s only fair, when  you take such an interest in me as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sometimes, I wonder why I bother.” Shion glanced at Kaname. “How about you, Kenjou-kun? What would you do in this situation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  folded her arms. “I’d just get it over with. I hate people who are  wishy-washy about these things.” She broke from her dramatic pose to  eat another piece of sushi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi paused for a moment, feeling slightly shaken. <em>Well, I shouldn’t expect Kaname to say anything else…not bothering to understand is how she comforts people. But still-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  say that very easily, but I can guarantee it.” Shion looked haughty for  a moment. “If it were you in my place, you wouldn’t be so blunt. The  truth is that things like <em>do what feels right </em>and <em>always make your feelings clear </em>are  very easy things to say, but almost impossible in practise. There are  too many uncertainties. A shy and reserved person like you would be  worse than most, in fact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned. “Yeah, alright, maybe  you have a point. But I still find it irritating in other people. Isn’t  that a natural thing? Hypocritical or not doesn’t come into it, it’s  the way everyone is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Unfortunately, that’s true enough,” Shion  said, looking round the table. “But when I look at you, I think you’d  all be the same. So don’t lecture me too zealously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The only one lecturing zealously around here is you,” Momomi muttered. “You don’t have to be so defensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She looked surreptitiously round the table. <em>So  there’s me, who likes my best friend and… well… all the things I said  I’d like to do to father, I kinda meant them. Thank God Kaname hasn’t  caught on, I said that in Japanese… what was I thinking? And then  there’s Shion and her uncertain relationship with this Isae girl, and  her inability to follow that up. On top of that, I’m still not totally  convinced Amiki is innocent as well. The only thing worse than falling  for your best friend who’s the same sex as you would probably falling  for your best friend who’s the same sex as you who’s also your employer  and master. That’s just plain awkward. Of course, it’s hard to tell  with Amiki, she’s difficult to read…but she strikes me as the martyr  type as well. At least when I decide I won’t tell Kaname my feelings  it’s for my own selfish pragmatism. I don’t think it’s noble or  anything. But I may be reading too much into this. Perhaps I’m just  projecting my own insecurities and messed-up situation onto other  people to pretend that I’m not weird and alone? It’s impossible to  tell. Angsting too much about these things really reminds you of how  difficult it is to ascertain anything, especially about oneself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, if it isn’t our <em>other </em>meddling upperclassmen,” Kaname remarked, looking up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Be  grateful, the Etoiles really do offer you more support than either of  you deserve.” Shion shrugged. “Not that I’m complaining or anything, it  means you bother me less.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi turned and watched as they  entered together. Kariya simply walked past the queue and joined the  front as if that was the most natural thing in the world, while Serané  looked around, spotted them, and walked up to them. “I heard the good  news, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “It looks like I got lucky for once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, I’m very glad for you.” Serané folded her hands and smiled down at them. “Congratulations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi just nodded. “And how about you two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing  is concluded yet, but it looks like I’m being pressurised a little  less.” Serané shrugged. “Truthfully, that’s an optimal outcome. If this  matter is pushed to an indeterminate future, it’s the best I can hope  for. If I’m rejected outright, my parents will just find another suitor  to harass me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s hardly an ideal outcome, though.” Kaname  swallowed another piece of sushi. “I still don’t get why you can’t just  tell them to get stuffed and be done with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d rather not be disowned. I quite like my parents, despite everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If they can’t even accept that much about you, what kind of parents are they?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané  frowned. “Sadly, Kenjou-san, otherwise reasonable people can be very  illogical on this point. It’s my policy to try and work around such  differences as best I can, rather than hold an aggressive and  uncompromising position. And I do quite like my parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname folded her arms. “Well, whatever. It’s your problem, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Quite.  But I had intended to talk to you about something else, as well.”  Serané smiled. “Under the circumstances, isn’t a little celebration in  order?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname pointed. “We have sushi. Well, I have sushi. Momomi has rice and the world’s vilest fruit. And then ice cream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané  gave her a puzzled look. “Well, I don’t quite follow… but what I meant  is the possibility that we can get tomorrow off for you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked. “You can? That’d be amazing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Doesn’t sound like something Kariya-sama would approve of,” Shion said, amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané gave her a coy look. “Oh, I’ll make it up to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi winced. <em>No dirty thoughts. Dirty thoughts are proof of a dirty mind. Or are they proof of a firm grasp on reality right now? </em>“Well, that would be great. I could do with a holiday after a very stressful few days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, leave it to me.” Serané looked at them all. “I’m glad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What do you suggest we do with the time?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you can go anywhere you can get to and back in one day…” Serané said thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“With a budget so tight you could knock in nails with it,” Momomi clarified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah,  of course. Well, in that case, there’s always the town. It isn’t much,  but it has a park, a library, restaurants and plenty of places to go  shopping. I’ve spent perfectly pleasant time there myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  can second that,” Shion agreed. “Well, half that town’s economy is  based on fleecing us on weekend days, so there’s always plenty to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sounds like a bother.” Kaname rubbed her face. “But I guess it’s better than lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m glad you think so. Well, Kari-chan’s calling.” Serané stepped back and nodded. “Enjoy yourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned. “So we can all go together, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To a raise another subject,” Amiki remarked. “Is it just me, or are we receiving a fair few thousand-yard stares?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  looked round and realised that they’d just had a short but friendly and  familiar conversation with one of the school’s great idols. “Well,  people have been executed for less. And we’re repeat offenders.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is a little unfortunate.” Olesa returned the hostile stares in her usual cold way. “I never got to write a will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Was that another one of her jokes? It’s so hard to tell…</em>Momomi just sighed and ate some more rice.</span></p>
