<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">-------------------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya: Hiding my feelings</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  slept early yesterday, right after dinner. Why? ... Now that I asked  myself, I probably just felt awkward and pathetic not being able to  speak, and I got used to this early routine after avoiding Hikari the  past week. Now it’s just 4am and I'm already wide awake, I remain  laid on my bed hoping to fall asleep again. I released a quiet sigh  as I looked at my roommate's sleeping face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>'She's  so cute'</em> instantly popped into my head. I had to mentally kick  myself to keep me from daydreaming...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  really have to get over her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then forced myself to turn to my other side so that I would be facing  the wall beside my bed. It wasn't as appealing to look at compared to  Hikari's sleeping face, but this was for the best. She has Amane-san  now, and it seems that their relationship is beginning to develop...  what kind of a friend am I, if I interfered with that. What kind of  friend was I for trying to take her like that? I still can barely  believe I did what I did that night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  recalled that something like this happened the day after Hikari and I  made up. No! That would be an understatement. Those were exactly the  thoughts that I had that day. I hated myself for what I did. I regret  that maybe... even after she said we'll be best friends forever...  That eventually she will become distant from me. And I can only blame  myself for that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  felt like crying, nothing new. But I can’t chance Hikari seeing me  cry! I'm sure that would hurt her. I decided to take shower. Sure it  was early and the water would probably be freezing cold at the start.  But at least I could cry in there a while. I got up, got my uniform  ready and stepped into the bath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was right the water was cold, my teeth chattered for a few seconds  before the water began warming up. I just stared down at drain,  letting my tears mix with the warming water. I was crying... very  hard… and if it wasn't for me loosing my voice. Hikari would  probably have heard me now. I slowly got down to my knees, my legs  just felt weak. As if loosing all will to stand at all… and just  cried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  stepped out of the shower probably about 30 minutes later. I felt a  little better. At the very least enough not to break down like that  in public. I then dried off and changed into my uniform. It was still  so early, but I decided I didn't want to stay in this room or to be  more accurate too close to Hikari. Just looking at her increases the  guilt and pain I feel. I gathered my things into my bag except for  the new notebook, which I would probably need to use a lot. I stepped  out of the room quietly, even slowly closing the door so that the  lock won’t make a sound. From there I had walked into the barely  lit dining room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was nice to know that there were people awake this early, even if it  were the keepers and cooks. I left my things at my usual chair only  taking the new notebook with me. I knocked at the kitchen, and was  greeted by the head cook. &quot;Ah! Good morning! Can I help you?&quot;  she greeted me with a smile. I was able to quickly glance down at her  name tag just so I spelled her name right then wrote <u><em>'Good  Morning Tendo-san! I'm sorry to disturb you so early in the morning.  But do you have anything ready to eat?'</em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  brown haired lady seemed surprised about me writing my response and  was about to ask about it, but seemed to have decided to get me  something to eat first. She grabbed some chopped up ham and onions  and a few green vegetables from the bowls that the kitchen helpers  were filling. Placed about a dozen slices bread on the toaster and  broke a few of eggs. She then began making an omelet which would  probably be enough for a few people; the aroma was almost making me  drool.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then called everyone to stop what ever their doing and have  breakfast. She then handed me a plate with a serving of Mixed Ham and  vegetable Omelet a few toasts and a special Hollandaise sauce that  just made my morning. She asked me to accompany her for a while I had  no reason to say no. She then asked me why I was using my notebook. I  then wrote about having some problems with my throat that might make  me mute for a while. Even I really didn't know the reason; just that  it wasn't something about my vocal cords but that I left out of my  explanation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  seemed to have bought it. I felt a little bad for hiding things, but  I would probably have a lot more trouble explaining that I have no  idea what's wrong with me either. I continued eating the delicious  breakfast that the cook had given me. She then spared me by not  inquiring about my voice. Instead she began asking my name, how old I  was, what classes I like, did I like being in Spica. I answered them  all in writing of course. She then asked me what club was I in. I  guess she kind of guess what when had my hand rub my throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  moved the topic to the sauce she served with the omelet, asking if I  liked it. I didn’t really know why but I found myself feeling  lively enough to answer her, I wrote with a big smile <u><em>'I loved  it! It really made my morning! Thank You!'</em></u> I then saw a glint  in her eyes. &quot;Yaya-chan Do you like cooking?&quot; She asked  smiling at me. I nodded and wrote that I wasn't bad at it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Well  if you like you're welcome to come in the kitchen and I can teach you  some.&quot; I was surprised by her offer and I have to say a little  reluctant. &quot;You don't have to decide now.&quot; I'm guessing she  could see my hesitation; I could only smile and write a message that  I'll think about it. It could be something to keep my mind of Hikari,  though I'll probably end up with a few cuts and burns if I do. Much  to my surprise I find myself silently giggling at the thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  cleaned up our plate, I couldn't voice out that I will to clean up  for her for obvious reasons. But she said something about me making  the best of my morning. I bowed to thank her; she smiled and waved as  she disappeared back into the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then headed to school. I must be crazy to be at school at 5:15 am. I  decided to drop by the school's infirmary, just incase the nurse left  the note somewhere easy to see. I arrived much to my surprise to see  the nurse actually there. I had written a page for <u><em>'Good  Morning!'</em></u> in my notebook. I could see the nurse's sleepy  smile when I showed it to her. &quot;Good Morning! Nanto-san. Here's  the note for you to show your teachers.&quot; She handed the folded  piece of paper to me. I took it and bowed softly as thanks. I opened  it and checked the contents. Not that I didn't trust the nurse, I  just wanted to know what I said so I can back the letter up if I need  to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  letter describes that I'm suffering from some sort of throat ailment  and that the nurse is incapable of medicating it but sees that it  will not a big hindrance for me to attend class. Though she advices  that I am to see a doctor in the city when I have the time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wrote <u><em>'Thank You this will do fine.'</em></u> She then smiles  and tells me &quot;You're welcome, Nanto-san. Oh yes… I have called  the doctor, and have asked for an appointment is Saturday a good  time?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  thought about it for a bit, I usually hang out with Hikari on  weekends. We'd do our homework and projects together, then practice  our singing or just simply enjoy each other's company. But after I  had I thought about it... I don't really have much to do this weekend  except homework. I sadly turned to the nurse and nodded. She smiled  at my approval and said that she'll inform me of the time later. I  bowed and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  entered the classroom, immediately heading for my seat. I noticed  quite a pile of papers placed in my drawer, surely all the printouts  for all the lectures I missed. I browsed thru them and tried to  answer as much as I can, when I got stuck at something I take short  breaks and draw something on my notebook.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  couple of hours passed and the students began coming in. Some of our  classmates came in and began throwing questions at me. Can't say I  blamed them. I showed them the note that the nurse gave me, and it  seemed to have answered most of their questions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari  then came in. &quot;Yaya-chan!&quot; I smiled and waved at her, but  then I noticed that she had a slightly annoyed expression painted on  her face. &quot;Where were you this morning!? I couldn't find you  anywhere.&quot; I let out a silent nervous laugh. I should have  probably left a note. I then wrote <u><em>'I'm sorry Hikari. I woke up  really early this morning. I decided to come to school early to get  some of my work done.' </em></u>I smiled as I waved the thick pile of  print outs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  let out a sigh, relief? Or maybe giving up whatever made her feel  like trying to argue and sat down at her seat beside me. I have to  admit... me not being able to talk seems to be bringing out a new  side of Hikari, she's not usually this aggressive or irritable. Or  maybe it was something else that caused it... I found myself staring  at her lips for a moment but luckily she didn't seem to notice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Classes  soon began for us. I took the time wait for the teacher outside  before it began. She merely nodded and told me she'll try to remember  not to ask me something that will take too long to write. Classes  were pretty much the same the whole day, sure I had to put an extra  effort to catch up but it was ok. I was actually glad for the extra  work, if it weren't for this I'd probably caught myself looking at  Hikari more than I probably should.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">During  lunch I had practically raced to the Spica's Cafeteria as soon as the  teacher had dismissed us, I didn't pull or invite Hikari. For one, I  was really hungry I had an early breakfast after all. Two, we  probably needed the space. And three, she would probably be off to  meet with Ama... Ootori, yes Ootori-san for lunch. I sighed inwardly,  feeling slightly bad for beginning to call Hikari's love interest by  her last name... but I do feel spite against her, even though it was  not her fault. I guess I can only really blame myself for being mean.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  quietly sighed again. I eating my sandwich and soup, and was  awkwardly surprised by a hand holding my shoulder. I shuddered and  almost screamed, actually I did scream but like before no sound could  be heard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  turned to see who it was, and was even more surprised to see a  slightly red faced Hikari. She was panting, as if she had ran around  the school. I began writing <u><em>'Hi! Hikari, would like to...'</em></u> but I didn't get to finish. <strong>&quot;YA ... YA ... Chan...&quot;</strong> she said quite angry and frustrated. I let out a silent and scared  laugh. She looked at me with her blue eyes burning with an anger I've  never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>&quot;Why  did you just leave me like that?!&quot;</strong> She yelled. I made a  gesture for her to keep her voice down. <strong>&quot;Don't ssh me!  Yaya-chan. Why are you avoiding me?!...&quot;</strong> Surely I had no  means to quickly answer. I had to think of something fast though, I  could already see a lot of our schoolmates beginning to stare at the  scene.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  bowed my head and placed my hands together in form of apology. Then  quickly wrote down in a very ugly and hurried penmanship <u><em>'I'm  sorry Hikari! I was really hungry, I wasn't thinking.' </em></u>Sure  it was sort of a lie, but now that I thought about it, I was telling  the truth… technically…I guess wasn’t really thinking of her  feelings then. Hikari then looked at my just about finished plate of  sandwiches and bowl of soup. She sighed and sat beside me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I'm  really beginning to think that Hikari's is changing a little. It's  kind of cute in its own way. I handed her my glass of water, she must  be thirsty after all that running as she drank it all in one go. She  slumped on the table after drinking, still trying to catch her  breath. I tried not to look at her too much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then saw the one person I didn’t really want to see. Still in her  Horse riding outfit, Ootori-san walked in to the school cafeteria. I  noticed her looking for someone and trying not to be obvious about  it, of course I didn’t have to think too much about it to know who  she was looking for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  tapped Hikari shoulder. She looked at me with a wondering look. I  forced a smile, which I found very tiresome, and pointed at  Ootori-san. She looked surprised at the same time very happy that her  crush was here. She then stood to go to her, telling me to wait for  her. I noticed that a genuine smile crept up Ootori-san’s lips as  she saw Hikari walk over to her. Not that I blame her… I tend to do  that myself... before…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  decided I should go… I felt sad seeing them together, YES… I  admit it. I am Jealous of Ootori. I mentally kicked myself as I  noticed that I skipped out of the honorific at the end of her  surname. I’m definitely becoming a mean person. I sighed to myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  still had much work to catch up with and I really don’t want to  face either of them right now. I decided to leave a not for Hikari on  the table. I wrote that I went back to the classroom because I wanted  to catch up quickly. Though it was true, I still felt I was lying. I  tore the page out of my notebook, folded it twice and wrote: “Hikari”  and was about to leave it and the table when heard Ootori-san called  me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanto-san.”  I turned to look at her. I faked a smile and tried my best not to  show any hostility against her, unlike the last time we came this  close to each other. For one she was the most popular girl in school.  Another was I don’t want Hikari to know that I disliked her. I took  the time to think and write my reply to her. But before I could, she  taps my shoulder lightly. “Please follow me. I would like to talk  to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had reasons to decline her request. I certainly didn’t want to talk  to her, especially now that I can’t talk. And I was about to tell  her off too… but then I saw Hikari, with a wishful look on her  face, which meant that she wants me to be friends with Ootori-san. I  pocketed the note I was suppose to leave for Hikari, I waved to her  and gave her a reassuring smile before following Ootori-san’s lead.  I saw questioning looks of many of our schoolmates. Particularly of  Tsubomi-chan’s, I bet she’s going to be bothering me about this  one when she gets the chance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ootori-san  led me outside, to the stables to be exact. It must be her comfort  zone. We walked around in silence for a while, I had really no choice  in the matter. She seems to be looking around checking the area for  other students. I can only assume she didn’t want to be seen  talking to anyone unless it was Hikari or for related school reasons.  Or she didn’t want to be seen with me as I wouldn’t want to be  seen with her. We then reached a large stone under a tree’s shade.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sit  down.” She said, it wasn’t an order but having no voice made me  feel it was. If I didn’t lose my voice I’d prefer to remain  standing. But then again if I didn’t I’d probably not be here.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  did as I was told, I sat on the large rock that we students have long  used as a bench, looked up into nowhere in particular just to avoid  eye contact with her and waited for the start this… “Talk”.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  the corner of my eye I could tell that she was looking at me… “I  know our first meeting…” she paused, judging from her voice she  seemed very nervous but there’s more, something else that I can’t  seem to point out right now... then again I don’t really care. But  I know she was trying to be acquainted with me, of course the only  reason I could think of for her to even bother trying is Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  felt weird, to be out here with her. I bet almost everyone in school  would want to be in my place right now. She didn’t talk after that,  was I that intimidating? I smiled inwardly… the thought of “The  Prince of Spica” was afraid of me amused me, but that didn’t last  long… I quickly shrugged off the thought and randomly decided to  open my notebook and began sketching. I roughly made a drawing of the  scene; the horse track, the stables, the trees around it…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  good at that.” She said, I turned my head just a tiny bit and saw  her leaning uncomfortably close to me. I gasped in surprise and  dropped the notebook as my body suddenly jumped away from her. Had I  not been mute, I had probably released a loud scream just then.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!  Watch out!” she said loudly as she tried to grab me before I fell  off the rock we were sitting on. I felt her hand clasp on my left  wrist, then a stinging pain, which I temporarily ignored thanks to  the pain of hitting my behind on the ground and a few randomly placed  stones.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  bleeding…” I heard her whisper. I had my eyes close trying to  recover from all the random pain when I felt something warm and wet  touching my wrist. I open my eyes to see Ootori kneeling in front of  me and… she was kissing, licking and suckling on my wounded wrist.  What shocked me was she had this worried yet blissful expression on  her face. I felt embarrassed, awkward and very angry. I hurriedly  pulled my hand away from her gazing angrily at her. She looked at me,  the almost uncaring smile she gives her fans wasn’t there, replaced  by a worried frown. She stood up and offered her had to me “I’m  sorry. I didn’t m…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  quickly slapped her hand, surprising her enough to stop what she was  saying. I wasn’t really thinking right now. I stood on my own,  dusted my uniform a little then picked up my notebook.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  don’t like you.’</em> I thought as a looked at her. <em>‘And just  because Hikari choose you doesn’t mean I have to start liking you  too…’</em> I never liked her, but I didn’t really hate her  either. But now I do… so much that I want nothing to do with her.  I’m such a bitter person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  remained silent, but not once breaking eye contact. Her eyes looked  saddened and pained almost as if she had heard my thoughts when I  thought them. I was quite sure this isn’t getting anywhere. I then  very lightly bowed in an almost insulting way and turned around to  walk away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait  a minute.” She rushes to catch up to me and takes hold of my  shoulder. I stopped to glare at her before shaking the hand off and  continued to walk away. She then grabbed my injured wrist, causing me  to instantly wince in pain and dropping the notebook.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  wait! Yaya-san.”  I stopped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Who  gave her the right to call me by my name?!’</em> I turned to her,  and mouthed: <u>“I hate you.”</u> I then slapped her left cheek  hard causing her hand to let go of mine and touch her reddening skin.  She just stared at me, almost fearfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  didn’t bother picking up the notebook, I figured it would only give  her time to think of something to keep me here to try this talk of  hers. I began walking back to the school without looking back.  Deciding that I’d visit the nurse to get this wound cleaned and  treated. Then maybe skip the rest of the classes for today…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Later  that day… I had managed to avoid Hikari enough to keep her from  asking anything that happened between me and her beloved. <em>‘I’m  such a bitter woman.’</em> I inwardly sighed at the thought. I was  still thinking of my excuse, but then again if that woman decides to  honestly tell Hikari what I did… I guess lying isn’t going to  help me much as she would surely listen to that woman instead of me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  looked at my bandaged wrist, and recalled the feeling when her lips  were on it… I felt hopelessly confused. <em>‘Why did I act like  that?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had noticed that some students looked at me nervously and some with  hostility. I bet they saw us a while ago. That woman is popular after  all, I wouldn’t disregard the possibility that she has stalkers  here in the school.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  thoughts were then interrupted when a certain pink haired  underclassman sat in front of me with an angry look in her face. With  the new notebook I had bought before my visit to the infirmary I  wrote: <u><em>‘Tsubomi-chan, are you doing anything tomorrow?</em></u>’</span></p>
