<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The more I  write them, the more Amiki and Olesa feel like necessary but peripheral  characters. They, for the lack of a better term, act as a  communications relay between Kanamomo and reality.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Momomi  sat at the table with her dinner in hand. “So, this would be sick girl,  the girl tending to her and the girl who’s been busy with school play  work. How are you all?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shuttub.” Olesa sniffed audibly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked. “You mean you really are sick?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You don’t say,” Olesa managed, massaging her throat. “I feel terrible. Hopefully you’ll catch it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  what the hell did you think?” Amiki asked. “That Shion put us up to it?  Do you seriously believe we’d go along with one of her schemes and miss  the chance to scrounge off you for a day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi considered this. “Well, when you put it that way, you’re right. It was a pretty foolish assumption on my part.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Okay, so we hammed it up a bit. But she’s got a bad cold, so bear that in mind!” Amiki folded her arms righteously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d  like to point out that you’re almost certainly going to catch it as  well,” Kaname observed, looking up from her food. “Especially if you  have been by her side all day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. Well, I’ll just sneeze all over you when that happens, so don’t be too glad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  brought this on, anyway?” Momomi inquired. “It was no colder out than  this week than before. It was pretty mild, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a  phallacy thab…” Olesa coughed, clearing her throat. “It’s a fallacy  that the common cold is caused by low temperatures. They can weaken the  immune system. Probably just chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It isn’t just her,  either,” Amiki said. “Several other students as well, in our year  alone. It’ll be all over school in a week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We go for a day, and  look what happens.” Momomi sighed. “Perhaps we should spend the rest of  the week outside the school as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked up again. “That reminds me. 1vs1 or 2vs2?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki frowned. “What are you babbling about now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Starcraft.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Can you start making sense now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“4b4.” Olesa sniffed again. “Mostly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Damn.” Kaname turned away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned. “Is it me, or is Olesa even more taciturn than usual? I didn’t even know that was possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shuttub.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, aren’t we all getting a little off-topic?” Shion remarked innocently. “How was your dat- day, you two?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Freudian slip? Yeah, right…</em>Momomi folded her arms in her best imitation of Kaname’s pose. “Not yet. First of all, how was your day of <em>hard work </em>with the school play?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Very  productive, thank you very much. I achieved quite a lot in a short  space of time.” Shion smiled. “I suppose it’s just proof of what you  can do if you really put your mind to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You know, I’m not above a little deception myself from time to time…” Momomi began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked up from her meal again. “But there should be limits to barefaced lying, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  hard to believe that I almost missed you guys.” Shion shrugged. “Well,  in point of fact, I did spent some time working on the school play,  actually. I can’t spend all day on the phone to Isae, after all.” She  threw the last sentence in with an air of casualness, but there was  pride there, Momomi knew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It sounded like you could,” Kaname remarked. “You sounded like you intended to be there all day, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it was only for a couple of hours, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A couple of hours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s been about a year since I saw her last, Kenjou-kun,” Shion reminded her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More  to the point, shouldn’t she have been in school?” Momomi asked. “And  yet you talked for several hours… that most be one casual system.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She  said she was in bed with a cold, so she was glad of the distraction,”  Shion replied. “I suppose it’s a very small world. Though she didn’t  sound anything like Perez-san…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wonder.” Momomi looked down at her dinner, skewering another chip. Western-style today. “How did it go, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  pretty well, you know.” Shion’s voice sounded dangerously modest. “We  talked about some things, just catching up, and I heard some more about  her school and home life. She said she’d like to hear from me again, so  I should probably do this more often. Even if it comes to a formidable  expense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>It’s pretty amazing that someone who collates  information on an entire school, scores highly in all her lessons and  runs a school play on the side considers all those things normality but  takes pride in a simple call to an old friend. </em>Momomi’s lips twitched into a smile at the thought. <em>I  guess this is what you get when you do well at a difficult thing. And  what exactly is difficult varies from person to person, of course…but  it’s an interesting thing. It’s pretty hard to take pride in easy  victories and mediocrity. That satisfaction’s reserved for overcoming  difficult things in life. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“IM,” Olesa pronounced, as if  delivering a great truth to a hitherto-unenlightened world. She sniffed  and shut her mouth with a sense of finality, pulling out a handkerchief  and dabbing her nose in a ladylike way.</span></p>
“You should use instant  messaging,” Amiki translated. “This is the age of technology, after  all. That way you can have frequent conversations without any more  expense than your internet provision, which, of course, is part of this  school’s obnoxiously high term fees.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She didn’t even bat an eye,” Kaname observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You have a  point, but my darling Isae is quite computer illiterate,” Olesa  explained. “Perhaps I’ll suggest it to her, all the same. But the phone  calls are nice; they feel more human somehow. It’s good to hear the  sound of her voice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re sounding very lovesick, Shion-senpai.” Momomi gave her an innocent look. “Have you agreed to meet yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not yet, no. Someone hasn’t passed their exams yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re just looking for an excuse, and you know it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, I was going to ask you before,” Shion said sweetly. “How did your <em>date </em>go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess I walked into that,” Momomi admitted. “But it was all your fault anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More  importantly, that wasn’t a date!” Kaname insisted, glaring at an  amused-looking Amiki. “We just went out and did stuff together, that’s  all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki put her chin on her hand and cocked an eyebrow. “Oh, really? Isn’t that what a date is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes,  but we didn’t do date-like things, so it’s completely different. I  mean, all we did was eat in some restaurants and go clothes shopping  and stuff like that. It’s not like we kissed or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just give up, Kaname,” Momomi said tiredly. “I don’t think your helping our cause.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Her cause, you mean?” Amiki challenged. “Even so, that definitely sounds like a date to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We  were just doing stuff because you guys didn’t turn up,” Kaname said,  her face wooden. “That’s all. It’s not like we kissed or anything. I’ve  no idea why you three went to all this bother, anyway? Well, not that  I’m complaining, you can all be pretty annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How dense.” Olesa held out a hand and Amiki passed her a glass of water.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  take me too seriously, Kenjou-kun.” Shion cut into her battered fish.  “I was just teasing you. Has anyone ever told you that you’re  remarkably easy to tease?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Momomi,” Kaname replied, leaning back and folding her arms. “Once every five minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki rolled her eyes. “Figures.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, what did you do?” Shion asked. “Kenjou-kun’s initial account was rather garbled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She  got most of it, all the same.” Momomi shrugged. “We had breakfast, we  shopped for some clothes, we had lunch, we shopped for more clothes,  and shoes as well, then we then we went to the bookshop. A fairly  typical girl’s day out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There’s no such thing if one of the supposed girls is Kaname,” Amiki muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “God, that’s pissing me off by now…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  didn’t take offence at those comments, did you?” Momomi asked. She  smiled. “Don’t worry, you’re a very beautiful girl, okay? You’re fine  the way you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname blushed furiously. “You don’t have to  tell me that, it’s not like I don’t know. And I wouldn’t pay attention  even if I thought anything like that, so don’t get too enthusiastic  about giving your opinion-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Dishonest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki rolled her  eyes when everyone looked at her. “Oh, come on! You all know exactly  what she means. Now you’re just trying to piss me off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I don’t know,” Kaname remarked, trying to sound angry. “Do tell.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, for God’s sake… you enjoyed the compliment, but you have to pretend you didn’t. That’s obvious to all of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What kind of thing is that to say? I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Let’s  move on, shall we?” Shion said pleasantly, before the argument could  escalate. “Did you find any good clothes, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Quite a few, actually It was very fun. There are a lot of clothes shops there. That’d be because of this school, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  nodded. “Of course. It’s a very popular weekend destination for more  social students than- well, us. But a lot of my acquaintances go there,  mostly because there’s nowhere else we’re allowed to go unless you have  really important business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, when you look around that  town, you can tell. Not that I’m complaining or anything.” Momomi  flicked a strand of her hair out of her eyes. “Well, I need to start  getting out more often, otherwise I won’t get nearly enough wear out of  all these casual clothes I brought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps weekend trips?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you guys can come this time, instead of slacking off,” Kaname snapped, arms folded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We don’t want to intrude on you two,” Amiki replied, eyes half closed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, I was thinking about starting now, but I’m stuck here thanks  to the damn school rules.” Momomi sighed. “The curfew is archaic,  dictatorial and above all, way too early. I wanted to see a movie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Which one?” Kaname asked suspiciously. “Not the romance one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The romance one, of course. What did you think I wanted to see? The Bourne… what are we on now? I forget.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now that might actually be worth seeing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  rolled her eyes. “Fine. We can see that another time, then. But right  now, you have to take my orders, remember? Just accept it quietly, like  a good little servant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now that’s an unusual hobby,” Amiki murmured. “Your tastes run that way, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tch. Fine. But I’ll hold you to that promise, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki snorted. “Now the fetishists are ignoring me. I’m going back to my food.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, does anyone know how to get back into the school after  curfew?” Momomi considered this sentence then amended it. “Without  being caught, I mean. If I wanted to, I could knock on the gates and be  sent to the Church for another month.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And we haven’t even done  a fraction of the first month yet,” Amiki observed, sighing. “God, but  what a bother that was… are they really going to hold us to all four  weeks? That’s twenty-eight days, and a few more!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname stopped eating again for a moment. “Thank you, our resident mathematician.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, trying to break curfew is something of a risk,” Shion said. “Are you sure? Can’t you see it tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, guess what… my afternoon is booked up writing someone’s script and cleaning someone else’s Church.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The weekend, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s way too late,” Momomi replied. “It has to be today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you don’t mind being caught? The risk is always there, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d survive. I might begin to miss the Church after a whole month where cleaning it’s become routine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Both of you?” Shion asked pointedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Do you think I’m scared of a bunch of annoying nuns?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki checked behind her opposite almost intuitively, but there was no one there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And most importantly, would you cover for a certain kindly senpai instead of implicating her if you were caught?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just what are you suggesting now?” Kaname demanded suspiciously. Momomi, quicker on the uptake, just nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion beamed. “Then I’m free to say provide advice without inhibitions, or moral responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not sure morality is quite that convenient…” Amiki muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, what do we do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  leaned forwards, checking to make sure that no one was listening in  before she spoke again. “Now, obviously, going out isn’t a problem,  we’re not under curfew yet, and you have a few more hours. But if you  want to watch a film, and perhaps do some more, then you’re right, you  don’t have enough time. Especially accounting for the journey too and  from town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “So what do we do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The first  thing is to look after your room. They check them, of course. First of  all, you should turn out all the lights, then pad the beds. I know it  sounds ridiculous, but that really does work if you do it well, with  poor light and an impatient sister who wants to see what she expects to  see.” Shion frowned, counting off on her fingers. “Is that it for the  room? No, and lock the door on your way out. They’ll only use their  keys past curfew, and even then they probably won’t bother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I… see.” Momomi nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“After  that, you have to get back in. The first obstacle is the outer bounds  of the school. The main gate is a bad place, because there are lots of  cameras there. It’s no good escaping the sisters if you leave that kind  of evidence. The wall itself is pretty impenetrable, except in one  location…” Shion sighed. “I wish I had my laptop here. Then I could  show you things more clearly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t wish for that, really. You’re scaring me enough as it is,” Kaname said. “What are you, a drugs smuggler?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  just smiled sweetly. “In any case, it’s on the left side as you walk  out, right as you come in. Thick ivy on the outside and a very  climbable tree on the inside… it takes a lot of physical fitness, but  you can do it. Kenjou-kun will be fine, I’m more worried about you,  Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, thanks,” Momomi replied, pouting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t worry. I’ll look after her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There’s  a camera there, but it barely covers that point. Keep your face down  and you’ll be fine, there’s a little leeway in staff attitudes. But  that’s the easy part. The inner wall doesn’t have any cameras, simply  because we didn’t pay this much to be stalked by cameras… considering  the forest gets everywhere, it’s easy enough to climb a tree and jump  over. It’s a bit of a drop, but you’ll manage. The main doors aren’t  locked, but that’s because a sister periodically patrols the grounds  around the Strawberry Dorms. But they’re huge, if you move quickly and  quietly you’ll only be endangered about one trip in every five.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Right,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  will be dark inside, because the sisters patrol with torches if need  be. This is why coming in just after the curfew has some advantages  despite their increased visibility. It increases your visibility too.  Of course, that’s useless in winter, like now. Luckily your room is  near the stairs, so you have a chance of getting home free. Remember  you’ve locked the door and opened it quickly. However, your chances of  an encounter are high.” Shion gave her a serious look. “Indoors,  though, you have an advantage. Keep your cool and say you left your  Geography textbook in the classroom or whatever, and went to fetch it  so you could study.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Both of us?” Kaname asked critically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  why it’s useful to invent a study date or somesuch. Work on your cover  story and rehearse it. Ideally, you should have a different one for  each possible place you could be caught.” Shion folded her arms and  smiled brilliantly. “But that’s about it. That’s how you beat the  system.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi stared for a long moment. “How do you know this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  to be honest, it’s all past experience. I was quite the young tearaway  in my first year.” Shion looked past them, reminiscencing. “I’d grown  very used to an independent lifestyle with few questions asked from my  parents… it took me quite some time to adapt. In the meantime, I used  to break curfew for the hell of it. I always dragged Isae with me, too,  and she’d always panic. She wasn’t good with getting caught. And, at  first, we did get caught, an awful lot, so I worked it all out, from  first to last. She said I was a genius. A mad one, but a genius, all  the same…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi put her head in her hands. “No-one asked that.  Well, I see. You’re always surprising, Shion-senpai. Now you’re one of  the more officious students here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, a true rebel isn’t a  dogmatist,” Shion explained. “Once you’ve done something for a while,  the correct thing to do is to rebel against your own counter-culture  and do something completely different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That doesn’t make any sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  smiled. “Isn’t that the point? But bear in mind, an even easier way  around the system is to come back before curfew. Sometimes fighting is  harder. But I like people to have a range of options to choose from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  all mad,” Amiki said, shaking her head. “Completely mad. Can’t you  watch the film in the safety of your room on the computer like sane  people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s even less legal,” Momomi noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The chances of you being caught are infinitesimally smaller.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  it sounds like it’d be a lot easier if we just let ourselves be  caught,” Kaname said. “A lot less hassle, and probably a lot less  trouble. We were out celebrating, lost track of time, and got back  later. We’re very sorry. I mean, even the Sisters have to know we have  something to appreciate right now, isn’t that a mitigating  circumstance?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now where’s the fun in that kind of thinking, Kenjou-kun?” Shion asked. “You’re not taking irresponsibility seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She has a point, actually,” Momomi said. “I might go with that idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“After I bequeathed you with the fruit of my many hard, nerve-wracking hours of research? You’re always so ungrateful…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s like you said, isn’t it?” Momomi teased. “Having a range of options to choose from?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“People  say that, Kiyashiki-san, but they really mean that you should pick one  of their options,” Shion pointed out. “Really, everyone wants  everything to go their way, but nothing’s that easy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know. Don’t be too dramatic about this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How said anything about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Olesa put her cutlery down with an air of formality. “We’ll be going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Amiki  nodded and imitated her, standing and turning to follow her lady.  “Well, good luck on your commando raid, or whatever. See you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi checked her watch. “We’d better get a move on, too. Especially if we intend to go through with this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “You’re pushing a casual bet to the breaking point, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Scared?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not at all. It just sounds tiring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion  smiled, standing herself and tucking her chair in. “In any case, I  expect great things of you two. When you’re paying attention. See you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Bye.” Momomi watched her go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname scowled. “Such a weird girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’s not like you can talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  walked back to their room in a companionable silence, before Momomi  opened the door and stepped through. She sat on her bed and sighed.  “Right. We have an hour and a half to curfew, so if we both shower  quickly, get dressed and go, we’ll still have enough time to retain the  conceivable pretext of running some small errand. Buying… no, getting a  refund on something. I’ll think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re really going through with this?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi shrugged and smiled. “Isn’t it a little interesting?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Let’s  just say this wasn’t what I anticipated when you said things would be  different afterwards, and we’d start to act in ways that would impress  people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shouldn’t we make the most of this time, then?” Momomi  frowned. “Call it a stag party, I guess. One last holiday from  responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When you put it that way, I take your point.” Kaname sat opposite her, frowning. “You’ll enjoy this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  nodded, not quite trusting herself to speak when faced with that soft,  questioning tone, those gentle red eyes. “I suppose I want to have some  memories, to make up for all that time when I was afraid of having  anything precious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What’s with the rush, though?” Kaname asked.  “Wouldn’t that kind of thing make more sense if you were expecting to  go home tomorrow or whatever?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess so,” Momomi admitted, smiling weakly. “Just trust me, okay? It’s something I want to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  snorted. “Well, I suppose that’s a decent reason. I’m not doing this  for any stupid bet, either. But I’ll put up with it for your sake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “Thanks. It means a lot to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked away. “Don’t sound so serious. It doesn’t feel right…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  giggled. “You really can’t handle earnestness, can you? Oh, well. It’s  fine. I’ll shower first. You start about Shion’s bed plan, can you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She  walked into the bathroom and shut the door, leaning on it for a moment  and closing her eyes. Then she stumbled through the motion of  undressing, fingers moving awkwardly around the unfamiliar clothes.  Finally, she stepped into the shower, feeling vaguely cleansed. <em>Which  is odd, as it was a cold day. I guess I just feel claustrophobic about  being myself right now. Is that even possible? Does that make any  sense? </em>She turned on the tap, letting water run over her. <em>It  feels good. Both for the water itself, which eases my tiredness and  tension, and because I can have a few minutes away from Kaname. It’s  not like I didn’t enjoy today… no, it’s the opposite problem, I enjoyed  it far too much. Even if it’s not real, even if there’s no meaning,  imagining myself on a date with Kaname is far too seductive. I have to  watch my every action, check my every word, practise that frustrating,  fluttery dance… close enough to hint at my feelings, but not so close  as to be endangered without hope of extrication. Like a moth to a  flame. Even though I know the danger, I’m still drawn to her, as more  than the friend she should be to me. I can’t help myself, I still have  to act like this, teasing, probing and brushing up against the limits  of my relationship…I understand I’m going to be burned, but I can’t  help myself. To be able to drop my guard and think about my feelings,  rather than husbanding them so jealously and controlling them so  rigidly, I suppose that is a relief. That’s what eases my pain, even  more than the water that cleanses my body. I just wish my soul was that  easy to purify.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pulled her hair out of her eyes, trying not to sigh. It wouldn’t do to be heard. <em>I’m  sorry, Kaname. I really am. But ever since I become able to entertain  the idea that I might like you…I haven’t been able to think about  anything but that possibility. I wish I could describe it, even to  myself. You’re not a very easy person to love. You’re brilliant and  beautiful but you have a difficult personality, no social skills and a  dangerously violent side. When I put it like that, it sounds stupid  that anyone should ever like you at all. But you’re more than that.  You’re tough and loyal and dependable and constantly surprising,  sometimes protective, sometimes tactful, sometimes kind, there’s always  a little bit more of yourself that you keep hidden from the world, and  I feel like I’m the only person who gets to see these things in you.  And you’re so vulnerable, and yet so strong. That doesn’t even make  sense, but I guess none of this stuff does. It’s impossible to put into  words, even in my head. I…like you. There’s really no more to it than  that, but it’s something that haunts me, day and night. It’s a subtle  but powerful thing, an absolute compulsion. I don’t know exactly what  it is I want from you, but it’s more than just friendship. So much  more. I don’t know anything about these things and neither do you, but  it’s still you I want to learn with. What is it? Simple biology? A  social thing? Or is it just something inevitable for me, who had no  real friends, to fixate so absolutely to the first person that  understands me? I don’t know. The more I think, the more I realise I  don’t know anything at all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>But it comes down to this…the  moth that flies to the flames has two choices. It can sit back and  flutter, and let itself be lulled into a slow demise. Or it can fly  forwards and embrace its destiny. I can’t keep this up forever. No,  more than that, I don’t want to keep this up forever. I want this  uncertain feeling to go away, one way or the other. That’s my favourite  phrase now. One way or the other. You know I like someone and you don’t  know who and it can’t be many people and I’ve never flat-out said that  it isn’t you. I’ve dropped some broad hints and flirted fairly  shamelessly, because I know I want her to know. It’s not something I  can resist, it just feels right. Because she </em>is <em>that beautiful, she </em>is <em>that endearing, she </em>is <em>that  precious to me, so why shouldn’t I tell her? Even if I say I don’t want  things to change, that won’t happen. One day she’ll ask and if I lie  I’ll be broken forever inside and if I tell the truth she’ll know and  nothing will be the same, ever again. Once I’m done with my parents  everything will be different…how naïve could I be? I’m the one who’s  different, and my biggest fear is that Kaname’s the same. That’s why I  have to tell her, and soon, so it’s at least on my own terms. I can  worry about the moment and struggle with the words. I’ll have to force  myself, so badly, because I’m so afraid, I’ve never been this scared  about anything before…not even leaving this school. But I’m even more  afraid that she’ll confront me herself, or worse, know and not say a  word, too disgusted to talk about it. I couldn’t live with that, and  I’m a coward, so I’ll take courage from me fear and say it. Otherwise  it just feels like I’ll come to pieces inside. In all those thoughts,  you don’t count, Kaname. I can’t bring myself to ask what you’d want,  I’m busy with my own issues. So I’ll be imposing the best solution to  my problems on you, and that might hurt you. I’m sorry. But that’s just  an empty word. I won’t apologise. I swear, I won’t. No matter what  happens, this can’t be helped. I don’t want to have to say sorry for it.</em></span></p>
Kaname knocked on the wall. “Hey… you out yet?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked, recovering herself. “Not yet!” She repressed a feeling of irrational bitterness. <em>Not even in the shower, is it? I wonder what it would be like, to be able to tell you anything without fear…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Damn. Taking your sweet time, aren’t you? Are you sure you don’t want to collapse onto your bed instead?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m sure,” Momomi replied. “I’ve thought about it a lot, and I’m decided. It doesn’t matter if I’m a little tired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do you really want to see this film that much? How good can it be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s hard to explain. I just think that this should be a special day. Even if I have to force myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That doesn’t make a lot of sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  could see her in her mind’s eye, sitting on her bed, resting her head  against the wall, hugging her knees in that casual way and leaning  back, perhaps, eyes on the ceiling, half-closed and languid. The whole  thing was slumped, comfortable, lazy, and somehow heartbreakingly  beautiful. “I guess it doesn’t. But it’s true, all the same. I want to  memorise this day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It makes me uneasy, though. You sound a lot  of things, Momomi, but somehow, you don’t sound- happy. Just that  affected enthusiasm you pass off as happiness sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi closed her eyes, not trusting herself to speak. <em>Damn… since when was she this perceptive? Can’t you always be an oblivious blockhead for me, Kaname?</em></span></p>
“It’s your family, isn’t it?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What?” Momomi caught herself, and switched to a defensive tone.  “What are you talking about? You don’t have to make up ridiculous  pop-psychological theories-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’ve been strange ever since you  ran into your father. It’s not like I blame you or anything, but aren’t  you just going this far to forget about him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s ridiculous!” Momomi asserted. “It’s not like I care that much about that bastard…” <em>I’m  speaking sincerely, of course, but I know it’ll sound like a defensive  gesture to her, that’s what she expects, so it’s still lying really.  And it makes me feel sick of myself, but I don’t have the courage to do  anything else.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. Well, it’s your responsibility.  If you’re sure, you’re sure. I’m not going to stop you from making your  own mistakes, after all.” Kaname paused for a few moments, then spoke  more quietly. “But I’m almost sure you’re worrying about something. If  you want to, you can talk to me about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And then you can  ignore the issue and call me an idiot for worrying about it, right?”  Momomi teased. But the jibe felt half-hearted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. You like it really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  left her statement hanging, creating a silence Momomi felt obliged to  fill. “Well, I am worrying… but I can’t tell you just yet. I’m sorry.” <em>Damnit! I just said I wouldn’t be sorry.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s alright.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Wasn’t I the same before?” Kaname paused for a moment, and Momomi could <em>see </em>her shrugging. “I know you can look after yourself, so it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>I  wish that were true. I talk big about how I take care of you, but  you’re the one protecting me when it really matters. It’s always been  that way. But you can’t do that now. </em>“I’ll tell you soon. That’s a promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sure,  whatever. Whatever it is, don’t lose any sleep over it, though. I can  personally attest to the idiocy of over-thinking things, now can’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t worry about me. I’m not quite as bad as you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>It’s a promise, Kaname. Even if we only end up hurt.</em></span></p>
