<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A little  more scattered than some other chapters, but I think it's necessary to  set the stage. The inevitable plot device that has been foreshadowed by  many a review is about to move...</span></p>

“So,” Amiki began.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what?” Kaname asked, trying to sound bored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you actually rejected her? I’m still getting over it. I thought you  totally wanted her.” Amiki dipped her mop in her bucket. “It’s not like  you weren’t acting like a dolt in love around her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For your  information, some people are straight.” Kaname glared at her. “And if  the conversation’s going to stay like this, I’m leaving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  always been pretty cowardly. Why run away from the one thing you need  to talk about? I know you’re not happy, I can tell that much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since when have you cared about me?” Kaname asked sarcastically. “Last I checked, you were some kind of rival.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since  Olesa decided to care about Momomi,” Amiki replied factually. “You  correspond to Momomi in the same way I’m part of Olesa’s life. Even you  recognise that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re not similar. I’m not paid to be with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you really think Olesa has anything to pay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not the point. You have a… a duty, to be with her. Don’t you?” Kaname  rolled her eyes. “That’s such an outdated thing. Our relationship is  more normal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, I don’t have to do anything? Did you  think I was born in the nineteenth century or something?” Amiki  snorted. “I don’t have to stay with Olesa, but I want to stay with  Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Well, even if you say that, you don’t have the right to talk about this. This is personal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Friends, Kaname. You should look up the word some time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her, a little surprised. “I notice that I’m only a friend when it’s convenient to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  still being as dishonest as ever.” Amiki rolled her eyes. “Or does it  disturb your feelings of tragic heroism to have friends? I’m sure it’s  so much cooler to be angsty and alone…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s not like I like you very much. But I’ve decided to care, maybe  just for the hell of it. You might as well take advantage of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It sounds more like you’re taking advantage of me,” Kaname replied, almost automatically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Call  it what you like. But you two are radiating way too much angst; it’s  giving me a headache. So you can’t expect me to just stand here and  take it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like how you come at me with all these different excuses.” Kaname snorted. “Can’t you at least stick to one story?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trying  to reason with you is like trying to fit the proverbial square peg into  the round hole. You don’t do reason, so I have to bash sensible ideas  into your skull.” Amiki folded her arms. “And this is a real good one.  Sometimes it’s smart to talk about your problems.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what’s there to say? She’s gay, I’m straight. It just comes down to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Woah, slow down. You’re <em>straight?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Don’t sound so surprised. Seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  it’s just like that has to be a bad joke.” Amiki smirked. “You’ve spent  the last two weeks flirting with her over food, blushing furiously and  generally acting the lovestruck teen. You threw yourself at me to  protect her, you went on an all-day date with her, came back, and then  went out again in the evening with her, of your own free will… and that  was to celebrate the fact that you’d thrown yourself at her father to  protect her again. I’ll stretch to bi, but you’re not straight, Kaname.  You’re not that good a friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should know, shouldn’t I?”  Kaname folded her arms defensively. “I don’t ask other to people to  tell me whether I’m gay or straight. I mean, otherwise Momomi might as  well listen to her parents’ glorious denials.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s a  difference, though. Her parents were being stupid, but right now you’re  the one being stupid.” Amiki shrugged. “You two have been very close  since forever, and more and more my jokes started becoming reality. She  was definitely flirting with you at times, and you didn’t mind. Hell,  you flirted back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just because she doesn’t like fish?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. Normal people would let the other person take it from their  bento. Feeding each other is definitely well over the couple event  horizon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know about couples?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A lot more than you, apparently. But can you claim that’s normal behaviour between friends?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We were just playing around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Isn’t that what flirting is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “Even if you say that, I never intended it that way. Neither did she.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that, but that’s because you’re both oblivious twits.” Amiki  shrugged. “But even then, I don’t think you act like that without a  reason. Whether you recognise it or not is up to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  whether or not you say that, nothing changes,” Kaname replied, feeling  irritable. “You can tell me I’m gay all you like, and I’ll say you’re  wrong.” <em>Though I’m glad I didn’t mention the hair brushing and the holding hands…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. Whatever. So, what would you do if Momomi was a boy? Would you be interested in her then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “Fine, so I’d date her if she was a guy. That doesn’t change anything, does it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you say that, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  she’s has a lot of wonderful qualities, and she can stand my presence.  I’m willing to admit that much.” Kaname shrugged. “She’s a girl, so  it’s moot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have a lot of confidence in yourself, a lot of  certainly that there’s no point in even trying. I’m not an expert, but  I’d say you’re being too certain in that respect.” Amiki glanced at  her. “People don’t know themselves as well as they’d like to think,  especially someone like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For the last time, I’m not gay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On what evidence? Have you ever even given it a try?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean, give it a try? What the hell do you want me to do?” Kaname scowled. “You just sound weird when you say that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People  like you can be stupid. You think everything has to be “yes” or “no”.  The truth isn’t so simple, it’s a sliding scale. That’s what I think,  anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s still a pretty clear matter, isn’t it?”  Kaname tried to remember Momomi’s lines, her glorious certainty. “I  know who I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes, the answer is both. And sometimes, you can say <em>I’m not sure. </em>That’s  what I would have done.” Amiki glanced at her. “Told her you weren’t  sure of your feelings, defer your answer, go on another date, do some  couple stuff, try kissing. Give yourself some time to think. Then you  could have told her what you felt. But you have to do be so  straight-forwards and simplistic, even when it’s not warranted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where’s  the point in that? Why go through all that when there’s a simple  answer?” Kaname rolled her eyes. “I’m not interested in that kind of  relationship. I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you’re not.” Amiki glared at  her. “Perhaps it’s just my instincts, but I trust them. If this is  certainty, Kaname, you can’t articulate it. How about you run with the  hypothesis that I may have even half a point and look at your feelings  like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “There’s no point…” <em>What if she does have a point, though?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is an important thing, isn’t it? Would one kiss kill you? If that  doesn’t do anything for you, then you can do what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname raised her eyebrows. “Are you volunteering?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  hell. It’s meaningless if it’s with me.” Amiki mopped the floor with an  affected casualness. “It has to be Momomi. That’s the only way you can  be sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, great plan. Sounds nice, doesn’t it? <em>Hi, I know I rejected you and you’re sore about it, but can I kiss you? Just to make absolutely sure I’m not gay after all.</em>”  Kaname scowled deeply. “I’m not an expert either, but I’m pretty sure that counts as trampling on someone’s feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, is it my fault you made a mess of things?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. I’m still pretty certain, and isn’t it better to be decisive?  Even if I’d done things your way, it’s just cruel to drag things out,  and maybe get Momomi’s hope up. And I’d only feel more pressurised to  say yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s better to be <em>right</em>,” Amiki retorted. “Even if that requires a little pain, it’s best to have that certainty. You don’t have it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I do!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  hell you do. Your stubborn pride is not the same thing.” Amiki glared  at her. “You’ve got this ass-backwards anyway. Would it be such a bad  thing if you were bi? Then you could date Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that  all the more reason for me not to build up false hope for us both?”  Kaname demanded. “If I start thinking like that, I’m going to force  myself somewhere I don’t actually want to be.” <em>Or maybe you’re just standing on your dignity again. I want to be right, even though things would be better if I was wrong. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not like that, one way or the other. If you begin with a conclusion in  mind, of course you’ll probably end that way. It’s bad practise. That’s  why I’m suggesting a scientific method.” Amiki started up the stairs.  “All conclusions need data to support them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say  that, it’s a settled matter, isn’t it?” Kaname shook her head  dubiously. “I think it’s better just to work things through as they  are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t force you to do anything. But think about it.”  Amiki shrugged. “Momomi likes you, which is a miracle in itself… but  that’s not the point. If you explain yourself, something you don’t do  much, I’m sure she’d be patient. For her own sake, if not yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You make it all sound so easy,” Kaname sighed. “Have you any idea how embarrassing it would be to even broach the subject?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t give a damn. Since when did crap like that have anything to do with the right thing to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Says the person who isn’t doing it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s still true. I didn’t know you were such a coward.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.”  Kaname sighed, facing the wall as she worked to conceal the blush  blooming on her cheeks. “It’s not my fault I’m not comfortable talking  about this stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re going to have to learn, aren’t  you?” Amiki shrugged. “Who knows or cares about the specifics? What I  feel now is more important, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that,  it’s the way I think. I’ve always thought of her as my best and only  friend, but not more than that. It’s a matter of… perception.” Kaname  wondered why she was even bothering to find words. <em>Probably because I need to have this conversation with myself. Amiki’s irrelevant. </em>“I never saw her as a romantic partner. I don’t think I can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For someone like you, never before might just been you’re being oblivious and stupid. Like I said, think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  problem is, people see the world in such simple ways. I have to be  this, I have to be that… we categorise things so forcefully. Isn’t  better to go by the feelings of a given moment? I like Olesa, say.  That’s enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you being serious?” Kaname frowned. “Well, not that I’m surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was probably just hypothetical,” Amiki returned, smiling as she glanced at the other girl over her shoulders. “Who knows?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, you’re exactly the opposite of Momomi.” Kaname frowned,  placing a hand against the wall. “For her, being gay’s something to  declare and something that’s an integral part of her identity. She’s  very… aware, of that fact, and how it relates her to the world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  because she’s met with hostility for those emotions, especially by her  parents. In an ideal world, it wouldn’t matter. In an ideal world, we  wouldn’t have to say it. We’d just go with our feelings of a moment.”  Amiki snorted. “Not that we’ll ever have such a world… but that’s what  I think anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re surprisingly thoughtful,” Kaname mused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be too surprised. I’m not stupid, you know, I talk about this stuff all the time with Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? What does she say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  sticks closer to Momomi’s perspective.” Amiki looked thoughtful for a  moment. “I’ve always thought that’s because I answer only to her, but  they answer to their parents and society. Me, I could care less about  what people think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Same here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right…” Amiki  pointed her mop at Kaname, dripping water on the floor. “You say that,  but you’re actually very sensitive. With a few people, at least. So you  have to be one or the other as well. But what do I know? I’m just a  little girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t punch like a little girl,” Kaname retorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course. But society doesn’t know that. Stereotypes can be useful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or a huge bother. Are we done now?” <em>If Amiki’s talking seriously, I really am screwed.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not quite. How are things now? I noticed you weren’t feeding each other like newlyweds this time, though that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  annoying,” Kaname blurted, glad she finally had a chance to vent some  of her complicated feelings. “Even if I don’t want things to get more  intimate between us, they were still fine the way they were. She  doesn’t have to pull away like this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wouldn’t you find it weird  to be fed by someone who likes you?” Amiki asked. “Isn’t that pushing  the boundaries of friendship just a little?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, maybe it  was,” Kaname admitted. “But I didn’t mind that stuff, I still don’t,  and it seemed to make her happy. So why does she have to start acting  so cold?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s probably being considerate of your feelings,”  Amiki replied. “Isn’t that the proper way for her to behave around you  now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Proper how?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it <em>is </em>weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our  relationship has always been weird,” Kaname retorted. “It’s pretending  to be anything else that annoys me. What’s the point in that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s proper? Come on, Kaname, if you like that stuff just tell her so. Have you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not that I <em>like </em>it,” Kaname hastily. “It’s just that it feels right. Those are two different things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki gave her an extremely cynical glance. “A little honesty once in a blue moon wouldn’t kill you, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  flushed again. “Yeah, say what you like. It’s just because I never  really ever had any friends, and I never had any real family either. So  I enjoy some of that stuff, so sue me. Momomi’s like my sister or  something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I doubt that. Younger or older?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname cocked  her head, considering. “Well, both. Younger in that I protect her, but  older because she looks after me and brushes my hair and all that crap…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She brushes your hair?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. What of it?” Kaname gave her a defiant glare.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  nothing. Well, if it’s bothering you, tell her.” Amiki shrugged. “If I  was to take a guess though, she might not be comfortable with that  stuff as well. Being close but not close enough… it’s rather like  rubbing salt in a wound.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think?” Kaname asked glumly. “I hadn’t thought of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  harm in asking, though.” Amiki glared at her. “It’s your  responsibility, Kenjou. No one’s going to fix this mess for you, it’s  your personal business. You said that yourself. So take responsibility!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah. Get back to me when I know what to fix.” Kaname shouldered her  mop, feeling a disconnected sense of irritation. “In the meantime, this  clock tower won’t clean itself. I suggest we got on with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki nodded. “Most sensible thing you’ve said all day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re as troublesome as ever,” Olesa observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  knew what was coming next, and decided she didn’t want to face it. “So  we have to arrange Twelfth Night for Shion. Have you given that any  thought? It’s pretty obvious we won’t be able to enact the whole thing,  and some simplification will be necessary in any case. It’s a  lower-level production.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I agree. We need to prioritise what we want to keep and what must go. I presume you’re familiar with it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat. I studied it with tutors, luckily, so I refreshed my memory by reading some summaries online. You?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I read it in the library here, in my first year.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t know you had time for that on your busy schedule.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even I need some leisure time that doesn’t involve intense competition.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  little light bedtime reading, was it? Well, whatever.” Momomi shrugged,  washing the floor in long, slow sweeps. “This makes things easier,  anyway. We can work it out between us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa nodded in agreement. “Do you have any thoughts yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you ask me, we should emphasise the plot that centres on Viola. In my  opinion, she’s the best of the characters, and the whole play revolves  around her. Malvolio and Feste’s subplot will probably have to be axed  so we can get as much of the rest as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I disagree. The  subplot is important to provide comic relief. The play could become  pretty heavy going without it. Besides, parts of it are excellent in  themselves, while some of the main characters can belabour the audience  somewhat. Orsino’s lovestruck angst springs to mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He may be  annoying, but he’s necessary because of Viola.” Momomi frowned.  “Besides, I can’t imagine you getting much of a kick out of comic  relief.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa looked pained. “I am human, Kiyashiki-san, as convenient as it is for me to pretend otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, I see your point, but less characters would simplify things a lot from the point of view of production, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  true in itself, but somewhat misses the point, I believe.” Olesa closed  her eyes. “This is not going to be the best performance ever seen. It’s  a school play; more than that, it’s a lower school play. We should  emphasis inclusiveness, not the opposite. That requires as many  characters as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that, but something has to give  somewhere. It needs to be workable as a play, too.” Momomi shrugged.  “Besides, I was never particularly fond of that subplot anyway. It was  first too flippant and then far too disturbing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s it’s  quality, I believe,” Olesa retorted. “Malvolio being locked up provides  some much-needed edge in an otherwise rather syrupy play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, but like you said, this is a lower school play. For catholic schoolgirls, too. They <em>want </em>syrupy. Anything else is overcomplicated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I refuse to set the Malvolio subplot to paper without that sequence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “Okay, I got it, Miss Artistic Integrity. But I still think we could do without the whole thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, we’re both making guesses as to the intentions of the  producers.” Olesa frowned thoughtfully. “Instead of arguing now,  perhaps we should assemble possible ways to write the play and present  them. They can make the choice themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s sensible  enough,” Momomi admitted. “I guess this way we can also include the  most artistic and least practical options, as well. It will make us  feel better, if nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The danger is that the  third-years in question are artistically minded, and no-one else.”  Olesa looked around thoughtfully. “On the other hand, we might be  underestimating our audience. They may be young but they’re well  educated and fairly sophisticated. We could probably venture some drama  as well as the syrup and humour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My fear is that you’re doing  them too much credit,” Momomi sighed. “At the risk of sounding  arrogant, they’re not all like us. But you’re right, I suppose. Better  to try and fail at depth than leaving it unattempted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So we keep the subplot? Ironically enough, it contains the most depth…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cynical,  aren’t you? There’s more to it than that.” Momomi shrugged. “Just  offhand, Viola’s famous speech to Olivia. We’re going to have to work  very hard to carry the meaning of that over, but we’ll lose some of the  magic, all the same. This is why I prefer to read things in their  native language…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that isn’t practical,” Olesa observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not. It still annoys me, though. Translating Shakespeare… we may  be smart, but this isn’t easy. Why couldn’t we use a pre-existing  translation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Presumably to uphold the tradition of using  student adaptations, they do that in the whole school play. So because  our senpais desire to keep up with them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed again. “This is a long way to go to placate the egos of some third years. It can’t be helped, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then there was silence, while they worked, and Momomi decided not to break the silence. <em>What  would the point be? That was a fairly pointless conversation anyway, we  can deal with all this when we meet up for the purpose later. And I  don’t want to talk about anything else, so it’s fine. If she’s going to  be like that, I’m okay with it. </em>Momomi shot Olesa a suspicious  glance, only to find her mopping the floor a few meters away in  complete indifference. More than that, it appeared she’d forgotten that  Momomi existed. She sniffed and turned away. <em>I shouldn’t expect  anything else from her, of course. She’s so cold and apathetic, I’m  sure someone could be shot in front of her and she wouldn’t even  flinch. </em>Momomi scowled. <em>What does she care about me, anyway?  It’s not like she’s ever really returned my overtures of friendship. To  me, I’m someone to do business with. Even if Shion tells her, what does  she care? It has nothing to do with her, unless she can find some way  to use it against me. Then, and only then, it would be of interest to  her. Not before. That’s how she thinks. That’s how I used to think, but  at least I grew out of that! Thanks to… Kaname. God, it annoys me that  things had to turn out this way, but wasn’t it inevitable with  hindsight? Just as long as she’s willing to remain a friend, it’s fine,  but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bitter. Disappointed  hopes. If I wasn’t bitter, then that would mean I didn’t care anyway. </em>Momomi glared at Olesa, still cleaning in silence. <em>But  she doesn’t give a damn, does she? It’s all one to her. She probably  thinks I deserve to suffer because of my father, or something stupid  like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi ground her teeth. “Why do you ask?” she managed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were giving me a rather unpleasant glare,” Olesa replied without looking up. “It’s rather disconcerting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just wondering when the hell you were actually going to say something,” Momomi snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say something? Should I say something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, perhaps you don’t think so, you damn cold bitch!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think I follow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi fumed. “You don’t, do you? Well, isn’t that nice…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  at a loss. If this is about the matter between you and Kenjou-san, I  thought it would be better not to say anything.” Olesa glanced at her,  face deadpan. “After all, if I took advantage of the situation to  comment on things, you’d accuse me and Amiki of manipulating you two.  You might well tell me to keep out of your personal life. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glowered at her and said nothing. <em>When  she looks like that it’s impossible to know whether she’s being honest  or whether she’s playing you for a fool. I suspect it’s the latter,  though. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa turned and grounded her mop. “Even if I raise  the topic, there’s not much I can say. I’m no expert, after all. What I  will say is that, if you want to be my rival, you should take  everything you want from this world. It would be pathetic if you gave  up just with this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me for being pathetic,” Momomi  snarled. “I got rejected! What choice do I have? If I kept pursuing  her, that would be horrible for her! I’m mature enough to accept this  and live with her friendship, so if that makes me pathetic-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not what I’m saying. You can be very literal sometimes.” Olesa gave her  a calculating look. “Kenjou-san can be very slow, and in any case  there’s more than one way to approach this matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?” Momomi asked guardedly, intrigued despite herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be  patient, remain friendly, and move on.” Olesa raised a hand to still  Momomi’s protests. “That’s not the same as giving up. Afford Kenjou  space to think while pressurising her by commencing the pursuit of  another girl. If she does have latent feelings, that will clarify the  matter for her. If she doesn’t, you will already have broken away from  your earlier feelings, and will be able to remain a better friend to  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell do you know about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” Olesa admitted. “I’m working purely from theory. But still, my calculations are sound, are they not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  the hell would Kaname care if I go after some other girl?” Momomi  folded her arms. “It may be theatrical, Olesa, but she isn’t going to  care. That’s where your calculations fall down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She has become  accustomed to you being with her always. You give her the attention of  a girlfriend, even though she retains the official status of friend. It  is necessary to correct that imbalance, so she can realise it exists.”  Olesa narrowed her eyes. “That’s the course I would choose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you say that, we’re just friends, best friends. It’s no different  from you and Amiki! Who are you to talk to me about spending too much  time with one person?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shrugged. “Alicia and I have an understanding.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “An… understanding?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  personal. Suffice to say she’s neither a friend nor a servant, exactly.  That’s hardly the point, though.” Olesa looked away, her eyes  thoughtful. “I am not experienced, Momomi, but the outsider sees most  of the game. That’s true here as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. Well, I was there, and I was rejected. That’s pretty final.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wonder about that, but even so.” Olesa gave her a steady look again.  “What would be the harm in trying? It wouldn’t be healthy to let Kaname  monopolise you. I’m sure she can manage a few lunchtimes apart every  now and then. If she can’t, she does like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shifted, disconcerted. <em>Somehow, now someone actually has a plan of action, I feel slightly cheated. But wouldn’t this be better than angsting? </em>“Well,  even if you say that… there’s no one I can think of I could  realistically pursue. No offence, but you’re taken and Shion’s too…  well… Shion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s one person who would be perfect.” Olesa shrugged. “If you’re not afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Afraid?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  won’t bear responsibility if you incur her wrath, but…” Olesa looked  around, then stepped forwards and whispered into Momomi’s ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi went white. “I can’t do that! She’d kill me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat on her bed and kicked her heels against the side, yawning hugely. “God, that was tiring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  telling me…” Kaname collapsed opposite her, flicking a strand of her  hair out of her eyes. “At least you didn’t sit there and spend an hour  wondering who the hell all these characters are, and why they like  cross-dressing so much. Honestly, a boy playing a girl playing a boy…  Shakespeare had some bad fetishes, didn’t he?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed, a  sound Kaname hadn’t heard in too long. “You have a point.” Then she  collected herself, attempting a more severe appearance. “But it’s not  like you had to stay, you know. If you were so bored, you should have  just left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With Amiki standing over Olesa’s shoulders? How  could I?” Kaname sniffed. “She’d probably have attacked you while I was  away, and then I’d just have to run back anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty sure of yourself, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  gave her an even look. “Sure, you can do all the wordplay, but nothing  shuts that up like violence. That’s where I come in, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  snorted. “In case you haven’t noticed, those two are our friends now.  They’re not going to attack me, even if you’d enjoy a good scrap.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. They’re that way now, but I still don’t trust them. Olesa can hold one heck of a grudge.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Aren’t you the same, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not a grudge,” Kaname complained. “I resent that accusation. It’s a healthy rivalry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.  Whatever helps you sleep at night.” Momomi shrugged. “I’m sure Olesa  would claim the same thing, and at least her rival acknowledges her  existence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that my fault?” Kaname folded her arms. “Well, it’s not like I care. An enemy with their guard down suits me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “You know, you never stop. You’re always <em>you</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course.” Kaname gave her a puzzled look. “That’s who I am, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. In any case, you’re in a good mood all of a sudden.” Kaname gave her a suspicious look. “Did Olesa say something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her?  Do you think my rival cares about my wellbeing?” Momomi shrugged and  smiled weakly. “I decided I was being too gloomy, so I’m sorry about  that. I shouldn’t act like that, should I? It’s a little childish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  it’s fine,” Kaname said, unnerved. “I mean, I can understand that… you  shouldn’t apologise for it, or anything, I don’t want you to force  yourself if you want to be melancholy. But I am glad you’re happier  now, of course! If I wasn’t, that’d just be odd… I’m your friend, after  all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed and smiled. “Just stop talking and have a shower, okay? It’s been a long day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked away and nodded. “Sure. I’ll be back.” She headed for the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi watched her go. <em>Sorry  I have to deceive you again, Kaname, but it’s probably for the best.  Even if it’s pointless, it’ll make me feel better. That will make you  feel better too, won’t it? I hope so, anyway. Otherwise I’m to annoy  you rather a lot for no good reason at all…</em></span></p>
