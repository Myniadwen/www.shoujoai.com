Yet to Come

      Thump, thump, thump.  Starbright&#39;s hooves made a loud noise every 
time they hit the worn ground of the racetrack.  As it was early 
morning, the cicadas had quieted but the birds had not begun singing.  
The horse&#39;s steps were the only sound. 

      Well actually, Hikari thought, there was also Amane&#39;s heartbeat.  
With her head on the older girl&#39;s shoulder, her ear was close enough to 
Amane&#39;s chest to hear that heartbeat.  It was more soothing to listen to 
than Starbright&#39;s thumps. 

      Even after winning the Etoile election, Amane still got up every 
morning to ride Starbright, and Hikari always joined her.  Sometimes, 
like today, Hikari rode with Amane, and other times, the blonde girl was 
content just to watch. 

      Round and round they went.  Only here they could do that.  
Everywhere else there was a long road ahead of them.  They would keep on 
moving forward.  Their lives would progress and not remain trapped in an 
endless cycle.  Making love had only been the first step, and becoming 
the new Etoile pair had only been the second.  If they wanted to 
continue to progress, more steps were needed.  The best was surely yet 
to come, and it would come with each step they made as a pair. 

      Amane halted Starbright once they had returned to the beginning of 
the racetrack.  Amane then got off the horse and as she was helping 
Hikari down, Shion, the Spica student council president, stepped onto 
the track.  &quot;I thought I&#39;d find you two here,&quot; the older blonde greeted.  
On her lips was a slight smile, but her eyes clearly said that she was 
rather annoyed. 

      &quot;What do you need?&quot; Amane asked as she led Starbright back toward 
the stables.  Hikari and Shion followed. 

      &quot;You two haven&#39;t done anything since the election,&quot; Shion began 
once they were inside the stables.  Amane was placing the horse back 
into its particular stable.  &quot;Etoile isn&#39;t just some figurehead 
position.  You actually have to do things,&quot; the student council 
president continued, her hands on her hips. 

      &quot;You wanted me to be Etoile because I was popular among the 
students,&quot; Amane said, removing Starbright&#39;s equipment and putting it 
away.  &quot;You should be happy with what you got.&quot; 

      Hikari giggled at that statement, but otherwise made no response. 

      Shion heard that giggle.  &quot;And what do you think of Amane&#39;s 
unmotivated attitude?&quot; she asked Hikari, turning to face the younger 
blonde. 

      Hikari&#39;s face became red as a strawberry.  She hated 
confrontations, but she had to stand up for her woman.  &quot;Well, um, since 
the election was only two weeks ago, we shouldn&#39;t be forced to do 
anything too complicated yet.&quot; 

      &quot;Huh-huh.&quot;  Shion&#39;s lips thinned.  &quot;This is the same problem 
Rokujou had,&quot; she mumbled.  Then in a louder voice she said, &quot;Don&#39;t 
shame Spica with your slacking.  You have some work to do, so be back at 
the school in an hour.&quot;  With all that said, she turned on her heel and 
left the stables. 

      Amane reached for Hikari&#39;s hand.  &quot;Let&#39;s skip for today and head 
to our special place,&quot; the older girl suggested, smiling broad smile. 

      Hikari returned Amane&#39;s smile and nodded eagerly.  They then set 
off for the place where the sun first shone upon their naked bodies.  As 
they walked, white lilies seemed to look toward them.  The road didn&#39;t 
seem so long now.</pre>
