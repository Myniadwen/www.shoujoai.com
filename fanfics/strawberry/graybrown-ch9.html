Shizuma stands outside Miyuki&#39;s room. For the past few days, the former 
Student Council President had not been seen in class. The irony of 
standing outside Miyuki&#39;s locked door, for a change, does not escape the 
former Etoile.

&quot;Go away, Shizuma.&quot;

Judging by the quality of the sound, Shizuma guesses, accurately, that 
Miyuki is sitting on the floor, on the door&#39;s other side. The 
silver-haired woman sighs and seats herself by the door as well.

&quot;I never thought we would ever swap places. Especially this close to 
graduation.&quot;

&quot;It hardly matters now whether I graduate or not. My future is assured.&quot; 
All of Miyuki&#39;s bitterness comes out in the way she says the word 
&quot;assured&quot;.

Shizuma sighs again. Long moments of silence pass. Then finally, 
Miyuki&#39;s quiet voice carries through the door.

&quot;Shizuma?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm?&quot;

A short pause ensues.

&quot;Will you...Will you write and tell me what it&#39;s like? Life in 
university I mean?&quot; From the other side of the door comes the sound of 
deep, heart-rending sobs.

&quot;Oh, Miyuki...&quot; Shizuma listens in pain as her roommate, her only friend 
in the world, weeps alone. This time, she cannot bring herself to call 
Miyuki a crybaby. Instead, she makes soothing noises through the door - 
and hopes fervently that Tamao&#39;s plan works.

~~~~~

A few more days pass. Miyuki is attending her classes again. The pain 
she had seen in Tamao&#39;s eyes when Tamao had seen her sorry condition had 
given her strength enough to rally. The younger girl was going through 
tremendous grief as well. Miyuki had no intention of adding to her 
burden by allowing her to witness her own lover&#39;s self-pity. But the 
sheer effort of pretending that nothing was amiss had been simply 
exhausting.

That first night after attending class, she had collapsed into bed, into 
Tamao&#39;s comforting arms. She had looked up into the younger girl&#39;s gray 
eyes - those eyes that had only ever looked at her with respect, 
admiration, affection and love. She had reached out and stroked the 
younger girl&#39;s cheek, and in a voice brimming with pain, softly asked:

&quot;Will you forgive me, Tamao-chan?&quot;

Tamao had smiled at her ever so gently, eyes bright with unshed tears.

&quot;Whatever for, Miyuki-sama?&quot;

&quot;For...falling in love with you. For letting you fall in love with me. I 
had no right, being promised to another...&quot; Miyuki had begun to cry 
then.

Tamao had held her close then, had stroked her hair, had kissed her 
eyes.

&quot;Miyuki-sama, I&#39;d do it all over again if I had to.&quot;

They had held each other that way until dawn.</pre>
