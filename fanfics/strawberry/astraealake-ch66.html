<p>Momomi gently unfolded the envelope, pulling out the letter and opening it up. “Let’s see… <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thank  you for attending the auditions. We have elected to give you the part  of Olivia. Please pick up your script at the first rehearsal, from  five-thirty to six-thirty today. </span></em>So that’s how it is. It looks like you’ll have to skip the first half of Kendo, right?”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. She was slumped against the wall, scowling and looking gloomy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What did you get?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sebastian,” Kaname grunted. “Just my luck. I have to play the stupid, annoying guy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look on the bright side. You get with me at the end of the play, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Wouldn’t it be more fun if I got to do that with someone else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cheaters are stabbed to death and dumped in the lake with lead weights round their feet,” Momomiwarned, smiling amicably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something to look forwards too.” Kaname closed her eyes. “So they did the twin thing, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably, yeah. It works quite well, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane  as Viola. She gets the best part, of course. Well, apart from Feste…  his way of tricking and destroying Malvolio is genius.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. It presents problems to an ethical modern audience, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ethical? So, not either of us, basically.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled. “I suppose so. But when we were writing I rebalanced the two  Twins as much as possible, to make them relatively even as roles. If  it’s going to be you two performing it, that’s only appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you anticipated this result?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shook her head. “Not at all. I just thought this would be more  interesting if things carried on. Whoever got one part or the other,  it’s definitely better if the fight’s dragged out for longer, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God. Doing unnecessary things like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s fun!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch.  No one asked me,” Kaname grumbled, closing her eyes. “What was with  that, though? Suddenly being that good at public performance is just  irritating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, she’s an Ohtori,” Momomi replied. “Knowing  her, she’s had the same kind of time-wasting training as me, because  it’s a done thing. Against that kind of opposition, it’s only natural  to feel a little daunted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not daunted. It just pisses me  off, that’s all.” Kaname grunted. “It’s not like anyone’s surprised by  this, not after that performance of hers. But if she’s sitting on  talents like that, it just makes it even more unforgivable for her to  be so damned lazy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “I know what you mean. Well,  we’ve still got a long way to go before the final performance. We’ll  just have to see whether or not she can put the effort in to succeed  with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “She’ll just swan in at the last moment and do it perfectly, right? Even I can see that. The lucky bitch…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, pursing her lips. <em>I guess this reaction is to be expected, under the circumstances…</em>“In any case, we’d better go for breakfast, right? There isn’t much time left in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.  Let’s get going already.” Kaname pushed herself off the wall and  kneeling to grab her schoolbag. She slung it casually over one shoulder  and walked towards the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, wait up!” Momomi spluttered.  She hurriedly folded the letter and stuck it in an inside pocket of her  blazer, then snatched up her bag and followed her girlfriend. “Don’t  rush, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you the one who said that we didn’t have much time left to eat breakfast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  but my legs are shorter than yours are. It’s hardly fair, right?”  Momomi grinned, walking faster. “You’re making my legs hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is what you get for staying indoors all the damn time,” Kaname noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean you didn’t?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just while I was at this school, and even then, I was never that bad. At home I did plenty of running.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Track running, or running from people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little of both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  well.” Momomi sighed dramatically, rubbing her forehead with her hand.  “In any case, this is going to a big bother, right? Are we rehearsing  every day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Obviously. You should have thought of that before you dragged me into this,” Kaname complained. “Or didn’t you think at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not that I didn’t think,” Momomi replied, pouting. “It’s just that I  didn’t specifically think about just how much time a lot of time is.  That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, be quiet and let me moan already! Our days are stressful enough as they are, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  telling me?” Kaname asked, sounding annoyed. “As it is now, there’s  nothing I do that isn’t troublesome. And Kariya is going to kill me for  missing so much kendo time. She’ll scream something about commitment or  whatever. Annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just have a word with Serané,” Momomi  suggested. “She understands the situation after all, more or less. I’m  sure she’ll be able to moderate Kariya’s excesses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish I  could be so sure of that… besides, going crawling to that pretty girl  is far too undignified.” Kaname scowled. “They already know far too  much about us as it is, without us running to them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? So you are embarrassed about that, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not embarrassed! It’s just annoying, that’s all.” Kaname scowled at  her. “How about you? It’s not like you don’t have that kind of moment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I guess so,” Momomi agreed. “So I suppose I broadly agree with you. But still, they’re pretty discreet, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  hell I think that. They tell everything to each other, for a start,  which is bad enough. On top of that, I’m still sure that Shion  blackmails them.” Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets. “That’s the  only good explanation for why they turned up on Saturday, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed. “I doubt it’s anything so dramatic. It’s probably at Serané’s  suggestion, to be nice, more or less. Don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, <em>someone </em>has  to have told her about it.” Kaname snorted. “That’s another thing, too.  Watching everyone fangirl over these two was annoying, seriously. They  walk into the room and everyone’s swarming all over them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Apparently. Kariya-sama somewhat less, of course.” Momomi smiled. “I can’t think why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  mean, they’re the most famous couple in the school, who’ve been  together since they were in nappies or whatever,” Kaname complained.  “Maybe before that, perhaps they went to visit each other’s wombs in  the summer holidays or whatever, but the point stands. And under those  circumstances, it makes sense how that seventy-five percent of the  school is crushing on them? Talk about a waste of energy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  attraction of the unattainable, perhaps?” Momomi suggested. “Or the  fact that they’re so obviously playing the right game, so to speak, or  the mystique of the title… you know, I have no idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if it  has reasons, that doesn’t mean it makes sense,” Kaname snapped. “It’s  like crushing on Amane, isn’t it? No matter how much poetry you write  nothing’s going to happen at all! It’s impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “I suppose that’s true. Amane-san isn’t in a long-term relationship, though, so she’s a little different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course she’s in a long-term relationship.” Kaname shook her head  irritably. “With the bloody horse. That’s where her heart belongs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled at her. “If you say so. You sound a little irked, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  Well, a little,” Kaname admitted. “But that’s the way whenever I think  about her, isn’t it? It’s like everything she says and does shows her  laziness and ingratitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t that kind of logic also go for the girl with your abilities who locked herself in her room for a year and a half?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  half a year, actually,” Kaname grunted. “I spent first year trying to  shoot that bitch down. Looks like nothing’s changed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you  really believe in people realising their potential like that, wouldn’t  it be more productive if you worked for your own good?” Momomi  shrugged. “Amane is hardly important, is she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s the goal I  need to beat to know that I’ve grown.” Kaname glanced at her, eyes  flinty. “Besides, if you’re chasing after someone, you’ll get better  faster. You should know that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged “I suppose so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever  the circumstances, you should always have a rival. That’s another thing  that makes Amane so damn annoying. She refuses to pay any attention to  anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still sore about that, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  doesn’t have to be me,” Kaname muttered. “It could be Kariya, if that  made her happy. As it is, she’s far too casual about everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. We need another good horse rider in the school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t look at me, already. It’s her problem, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When they arrived at the canteen, Momomi’s gaze swept the room and settled on their table. Predictably, Amane was there. <em>Just today, that’s a little inconvenient. Kaname’s in a bad mood, after all. </em>She looked sidelong at her girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unsurprisingly,  Kaname was using her trademark death glare on an indifferent Amane, who  waved vaguely then returning to her breakfast. “Arrogant little…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are rather agitated, aren’t you?” Momomi inquired. “Are you jealous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. Like I said, it’s nothing I didn’t expect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  well. Let’s leave it at that.” Momomi gave her a teasing look, starting  to queue up for food. “Just don’t get too angry, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally. What’d be the point in that?” Kaname asked. “Doesn’t mean I’m not annoyed, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed, rubbing her forehead. “Well, fine. As long as you don’t start  ‘practising’ on trees again. You’re not a manga hero, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Damn right, I’m not. Who wants to be something as brash and reckless as that kind of character?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Slicing through rocks with your bare hands would be nice, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’d have big breasts and no brains at all,” Kaname grunted. “You fail on both counts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi put a hand on her hip, flushing furiously. “Hey! I’m a growing girl, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes… at least I said you were smart. What do want me to do, lie?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if it’s true, you shouldn’t talk like that, you know,” Momomi  complained. “It’s impolite. You just don’t know how to treat a lady!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m pretty sure you’re no lady, so you’ll probably cope with the trauma.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Possibly.  No thanks to you, though.” Momomi closed her eyes for a moment,  thinking. “In any case do they also grow faster if I’m chasing after  someone?” she asked, opening her eyes and looking at Kaname’s  stiffening face. “I’ll have to think hard of Serané-sama, then. And you  can visualise Kariya, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You started it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  coughed, noticing they were getting slightly bemused looks from the  people in front of that. “In any case, moving on. What are we revising  today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Physics, probably,” Kaname muttered, staring fixedly at  the floor. “Though I’m open to suggestions. You shouldn’t just lean on  me for all this stuff, it gets annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry. But you’re the one who’s done this for two years in a row, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true. Even so, we can afford to vary the order a little, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There wouldn’t be much point, though. Your order is as good as any, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked around sighed. “We got too loud again, didn’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. We did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why does that always happen here, of all places?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows? I blame it on God, myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought you were an atheist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t believe in him right up until moments like this. Then I’m sure there’s a Devil, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fair enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few minutes later, they were sitting down. “Good morning,” Momomi said politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Shion replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, I have a plan-” Amiki began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you dare,” Kaname warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  we need to do is follow those two around, and whenever they do  something particularly entertaining, we hold out a hat,” Amiki  continued. “That way we could collect a small fund for the purchase of  props for our play, or something, I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, now, Rivera-chan, it isn’t nice to tease your friends,” Shion warned, clasping her hands. “You should be more polite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded, breaking open her chopsticks and picking up a lump of rice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After  all, insecurities like these are a serious business,” Shion continued.  “But that kind of thing doesn’t matter as long as you’re confident  about yourself-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chopsticks. Nostrils. Take fair warning,” Kaname muttered, glaring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion giggled. “In any case, you two are still entertainingly chaotic. It’s quite endearing, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, wonderful.” Momomi groaned. “I’m glad we’re amusing. Shall we do a little dance number, too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds good to me,” Amiki said. “But can Kaname really dance? Someone with big feet like her hardly appears graceful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa frowned. “That’s not necessarily true, Alicia. The most ungainly of people can prove to be good dances with practise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, what I was actually going on to say is that the fact that you  two are so flamboyant has allowed another interesting thing to occur  almost undetected,” Shion continued. “I was just telling Ohtori-san  about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Two of the five suddenly busied them themselves with  their breakfasts, looking firmly downwards. “What are you talking  about?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“These two spent their free time together  in town after the auditions on Saturday,” Shion explained, pointing to  the Spaniards. “And a little bird assures me there was a definite  date-like atmosphere going on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing like that was  happening,” Amiki protested unconvincingly. “We were just going out as  friends, that’s all. You shouldn’t get more excited.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if  it’s only that, isn’t it something to celebrate?” Shion queried,  smiling. “After all, prior to this you two hadn’t left the campus at  all in six months…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki winced. “Really? It felt like it was shorter than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,  really. So I’m sure you had a special, important reason,” Shion  replied, leaning forwards and resting her chin on her steepled hands.  “That’s quite the diversion from routine, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing so exciting,” Amiki said edgily. “We just felt like it. Can’t we have whims now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And of course there are a few other things I’ve heard from little birds…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your first years have no sense of privacy,” Olesa noted. “You shouldn’t encourage them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what else am I do, when my friends are so evasive?” Shion asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t we have private lives?” Amiki demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  fine, Alicia.” Olesa closed her eyes. “We went on a date. That’s all,  right? The rest is something we can tell or not, as we please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  pouted. “You’re all so boring. In any case, now I feel quite lonely,  compared to you four. How about it, Ohtori-san? Shall we make up the  numbers?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, but I’m busy with various things,” Amane replied absently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ouch,” Momomi noted. “That was blunt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See?  None of you have any sense of humour, either.” Shion shook her head  mournfully. “What am I going to do with you all, that’s what I want to  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, we’re all taking part in this play in some  respect, aren’t we?” Amiki observed. “That’s all because of your  dragooning, so I’m sure you can rest assured that you keep us more than  busy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true, isn’t it? I have done well…” Shion grinned. “Well, it should be fun. I’m counting on you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean you’re going to personally benefit from our hard work?” Kaname said. “Well, that’s nice to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  for Spica, and the younger years, and for yourselves as well,” Shion  observed. “Everyone benefits. Even if the way they benefit is  different, that’s still true. Just because what I gain is different  from yours doesn’t mean that’s exploitation, Kenjou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane nodded briefly. “It’s a co-operative effort, is it not? That is the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion nodded. “Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat a strange concept. In horse-riding, of course, I merely rely on myself and my mount.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  groaned. “Alright, whatever. So some people notice I exist, wonderful.  It’s not like I ever cared much for that goal anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should,” Momomi chided. “Staying as we are would be far too boring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Boring is fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  shook her head. “Of course, this is why I’m going to have a very  difficult job. There’s not one person on this table here who has any  grasp of co-operative effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the contrary, I always back up Olesa,” Amiki protested. “And Kaname and Momomi are another pair, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Considering  the way you four treat everyone but each other, that doesn’t count, I’m  afraid. But this is precisely why this play will be good for you, I’m  sure of it.” Shion smiled cheerfully. “However good you are as an  individual, if the play itself fails it’s your failure as well. So you  can’t just lean on your respective talents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine as far  as it goes. But how about you? Aren’t you competing with plenty of  people?” Kaname closed her eyes. “The older students, the other  schools, and even other people in your own year to some degree… you  just pick out broader groups of people to compete with. Isn’t that  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s slightly more natural, though. The tribal unit is  historically strong.” Olesa shrugged. “We would represent lone wolf  types, who were less successful on the whole, and generally shunned…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion groaned. “Don’t overanalyse. Play equals teamwork. Teamwork is good. Okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so,” Momomi said dubiously. “But-” She caught Shion’s look and went silent again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s start again, shall we?” Shion asked brightly. “It should be fun. I’m counting on you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Don’t bother.” Kaname leaned back. “Now I’m involved, I’ll do well for myself, not for you. That’s my pride.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll do my best,” Momomi said. “But I have my own reasons too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re just working backstage, so it’s not even a big deal,” Amiki commented.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,  we’re doing this so we can see what happens.” Olesa shrugged. “No more,  no less. There’s no need to feel like this is a favour to you, or be  indebted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Shion replied. “As if you’d let me forget  it. But for our own reasons, we can still work together, isn’t that  right? After all, we have one thing in common.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Kaname asked, sounding bored. “What’s that? Love? The power of friendship?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ridiculous,  blatant, shameless and aggressive self-interest.” Shion laughed at the  expression on their faces. “Well, am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not as such,” Amiki muttered. “But saying it’s a little much, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  so, I suppose you’re right. Rather than cute ideals, I’ll rely on  that.” Shion laughed, shaking out her hair. “To our mutual efforts, our  mutual success and our mutual benefit. Something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smiled thinly. “Sounds good enough to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Agreed.” Amiki smirked. “That’s something we can get behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think, Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?  Oh, right. That sounds fine.” She was busy staring at the fifth, who  was apparently oblivious to their conversation, lying back in her chair  with her eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The others followed her gaze. Without looking, Momomi could see their frowns and feel their puzzled thoughts. <em>So,  for all that, where does she come into this? That’s what we all want to  know. But if it’s what Amane intends or wants, none of us know where to  begin.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed and turned away, checking her watch. <em>So I suppose it’s something I’ll have to find out.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi, again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced at her, frowning slightly. “Hi.” She turned back to Starbright.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged off her jacket and exchanged it for her borrowed riding jacket. “How have you been?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well. You?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty  good, yeah,” Momomi replied, tying her hair back with the ribbon she’d  been given. “After so long doing nothing, I’m doing so much at once.  Even if it’s tiring, it is an exhilarating feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  this play should be good, too. Even though I’d normally hold out little  hope for such things, if it’s you, Kaname and I, it’ll definitely be  interesting.” Sol whinnied expectantly at her, and she patted the horse  gently on the nose. They’d been working together well recently, as  Amane would put it. Momomi smiled at the thought. “And Shion, Eida and  Hirai strike me as better than the average calibre of this school, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane frowned. “You aren’t very modest…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there a point in being modest?” Momomi asked. “I’m just stating things the way things are, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane snorted gently. “Ah. I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, I look forwards to working together with you.” Momomi  smirked. “Won’t it be good for you to do something but riding for a  change?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course, I like riding as well,”  Momomi remarked, rubbing Sol’s flank. “You’re softening me to it, or  rather this beauty here. We’d better get going, though. Break is very  short.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stopped. “Momomi. Can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, surprised by the use of her name. <em>Apart from her just now, who else calls me that? Olesa? Kaname…</em>“Of course. What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you still here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Didn’t I answer this one before? You’re still an interesting and mysterious person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wouldn’t you rather spend the time with Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  such a thing as too much of a good thing, you know. Though I’m sure  you’d argue that Kaname is a bad thing… never mind. You certainly  remind me that she’s very interesting, though.” Momomi smiled, putting  a hand on her hip. “If I was pressed, though, it’s probably for the  same reason that Olesa talks to you. You’re a very good confidant,  Amane-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… thank you,” Amane replied, sounding uncertain. She began to walk Starbright out of the stables. “We should go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  enjoyed the tang of the cold air against her skin, savouring breaths of  fresh air as they rode out. “This is a good atmosphere, too. After  spending so much time inside the school for various things every day, I  enjoy getting out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. That’s understandable.” Amane shrugged. “I, too, find it claustrophobic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  also novel for me, though. I’ve always been an extremely indoorsy kind  of person. Well, for a start, we were forbidden from leaving the  grounds of the Phareli estate for as long as I can remember. I used to  stay in almost all the time here, as well.” Momomi chuckled. “Not that  I’ve been dissuaded by any of that. To be honest, I have an almost  unhealthy obsession with the outside world on principle… I just rarely  choose to be in it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Amane frowned, glancing at her. “Is this because I am a good confidant?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really. This isn’t anything I’m excited or worried about.” Momomi  stroked Sol’s neck, looking round idly. “I’m just making conversation,  that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. That’s a strange thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Momomi asked, puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Conversation. People think they always have to be talking. But silence is fine too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so, in theory, but not always in practise. After all, they’re called awkward silences.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. So that’s what you want to avoid, when you talk to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  Your contributions to my conversation is for the most part an awkward  silence,” Momomi teased. “It’s just the done thing. I guess I’ve been  trained that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’ll always talk with everyone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I’m not stupid either.” Momomi shrugged. “And sometimes, silence can be comfortable. I’m aware of that as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  just her, you know. I do know more than one person.” Momomi looked down  thoughtfully. “Kaname’s one such person as well, though. Luigia, too,  and to some degree Olesa. I guess those are people who are important to  me, so that’s why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Luigia is your sister, yes? You have told me about her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Precisely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But can you answer a question of mine, Amane-san?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why am <em>I </em>still here?” Momomi waved a finger vaguely. “That’s to say, why do you continue to tolerate my company?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “It would be effort to send you away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Oh, is that so? Not as much as coming to our table every morning. You’re as bad as Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Should I be unhappy with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know I’ve disappointed your expectations on some level,” Momomi replied. “That’s why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that’s true. I’m not ashamed, either. That’s the way things are.”  Momomi chuckled. “I’m just uncertain of why you continue this, bearing  that in mind. There are plenty more people willing to take my place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Testing you and discarding you is far too cynical,” Amane replied quietly. “That’s obvious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is a modern age, isn’t it? That kind of behaviour is normal. I’d do it  myself.” Momomi shook her head in amusement. “It’s hard to believe that  an Ohtori would be so kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not defined by the name.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You let it define you, though,” Momomi retorted quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head silently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  you think so? Because I do. Your uncertain past, your very certain  future and your family appear to have a very great hand in your  present.” Momomi adjusted the reigns slightly. “Your life has very  little superfluous qualities in it. No friends or hobbies that you’ve  spoken of, but Olesa, I and horses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just my own choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so, but it’s still true, isn’t it? You just let live wash by.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. Some things, I take an interest in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The play, for example?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned for a moment. “Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s another thing I wonder about. It’s not like you to get involved in anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It looked interesting. That’s all there is to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smirked. “It looked interesting? Well, that’s strange enough in itself.  Why the play? Why not anything else that happens at this school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged again. “It was a whim. So I don’t know. Perhaps there was no good reason. It wouldn’t be necessary to have one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you want to achieve, then? We all have something prove, so it makes  sense for us. But for you, demonstrating yet another talent isn’t going  to bring you anything but inconvenience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t have a goal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why bother? You, who does so little but this, are well-aware of the possibilities presented by simple inactivity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “Who knows?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do,” Momomi retorted. “But you’re being defensive. It’s not like I’m not prying, though, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  me, of course, it’s because I want people to know my name. I want  people to acknowledge me, so I have to have some kind of triumph.”  Momomi sighed. “Kaname is the same as well. She has something to prove,  as I said before. But she’s less enthusiastic about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Sometimes, anyway, that’s true. She has mood swings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  for her, it’s a matter of identity, I suppose. Even more than me.  Kaname defines the world in terms of winning and losing, which is a  little simplistic, to say the least. She doesn’t relish struggle, but  she also sees it as the only way to grow. I think, it’s a little  confusing.” Momomi grinned. “And of course, she sees you as her perfect  rival.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If there was a conflict between us, you would side with her, wouldn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Even if she was being stupid, that’s still what I would do. Disappointed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I knew that already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I don’t understand you, Amane-san. You say you feel nothing and aspire  to nothing, but that’s a lie. Or at least, a simplification.” Momomi  glanced steadily at her. “Talking to me, listening to my friends and  taking part in the play. You do yearn for something. And it’s more than  merely getting better at riding.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “I still have no clear desires. That hasn’t changed. But there is something I’ve become interested in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I was right.” Momomi’s lips curled into a smile. “Is it Kaname? You  took an extremely theatrical course of action on Saturday, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was an innocent mistake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?” Momomi laughed. “Even for you, that’s a little unlikely, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane didn’t reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I should give you fair warning, I suppose. As I said before, I’ll  always support Kaname. And if you hurt her too much or too casually, I  won’t forgive you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is she someone who needs your protection?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  actually. In the same way you, too, need protection of a kind.” Momomi  touched her hair thoughtfully. “It’s the same sort of protection,  actually. Both of you adopt an act and a façade to protect yourselves  from the outside world, and yourself. Calculated indifference, asocial  behaviour and so on. But all the same, you do cling to those who  approach you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t appreciate that sentiment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you  were to thrust me away just for that, it would only serve to prove my  point,” Momomi replied. “In any case, I’m talking about myself. It’s  how I live. But is’ very lonely, isn’t it? Dull and tiring and lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I am not lonely. I am fine like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  Kaname’s in a funk and regretting the play outright, that’s what she  says. Sometimes it’s not even that. Sometimes it’s about you, or my  friends, or things like that. And it feels like she’ll still be sad at  times however hard I struggle.” Momomi sighed, looking away mournfully.  “That’s very annoying. I could give up everything and spend all the  time I have with her, but even then, I’m sure she’d still have such  moments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That Kenjou. My Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I don’t believe you if you just say that you’re not lonely. If you ask  me, everyone’s lonely all the time. That’s just how life is. Sometimes  people let you forget that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “But as I am now, that’s the case. There are people who let me forget that I am lonely. It’s still irrelevant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “And the play?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is of no special significance.” Amane closed her eyes. “Viola, however, is a character that suits me well in some respects.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can understand that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  truthfully, your part fits me better.” Amane turned Starbright towards  the stables again. “We should to say. We only have two minutes left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded briefly before she spoke again. “So, what do you think about competition?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s irrelevant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see… and one more question.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you going to do, if not even this serves to forge bonds with the people around you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t do anything unnecessary. Bonds aren’t necessary, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still want them with all your heart, though, don’t you?” Momomi walked Sol into the stables. “That’s why I’m here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  It’s a matter of something simpler.” Amane peeled off her riding  jacket. “You’re interesting. I’m surrounding myself with interesting  things, because that’s enough for me. There’s no need for anything  else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do say so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed  deeply. “I’m still sorry. I think I understand, on some level. If it  had been you, not Kaname, I’d come to understand first-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not important. It’s not anything to worry about. But…” Amane glanced at  her, crimson eyes bright. “You should be careful, Kiyashiki-san. To be  everything to everyone, in the hope that you could help them all, is a  futile life in itself. That won’t make anyone happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted, folding her arms. “Who said anything about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I won’t let you act that way. That’s final.” Amane shrugged on her jacket, grabbed her bag, and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi watched her go, frowning deeply. <em>She’s  wrong. I’m not trying anything as dramatic as that. I just want her to  be happier. It would be nice if she smiled a little more. Kaname… after  everything I did to Kaname, she has to understand that situation.</em></span></p>
