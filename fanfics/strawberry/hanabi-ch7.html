On Wednesday, Tamao had gone to the mailroom after class. The woman at 
the desk smiled pleasantly, and handed the packet of letters intended 
for the occupants of her room. At Astraea, letters were addressed by 
room number in addition to name, so that one could fetch their 
roommate&#39;s letters, too. The only way to avoid this was to request 
specifically that one&#39;s roommate could not pick up one&#39;s own mail; it 
was a hassle that few could be bothered with.

It was a slim pile of envelopes that was passed to her, and as she 
walked she sorted through them quickly. Three for herself, two for 
Nagisa. On her own envelopes were the telltale spidery writing of 
various elder relatives, and she smiled slightly, thinking of them 
warmly. Both her grandmothers had attended Astraea in their day. 
Nagisa&#39;s first envelope also prompted a smile, the address written 
haphazardly in the crayon of a six year old.

Yet... and now she paused, frowning. The second letter was neatly 
addressed at a severe angle, and the return address was one she could 
not quite bring herself to like. Hanazono Shizuma. Lillian College. 
Musashino, Tokyo. Her lip curled somewhat, a curdling sensation hinting 
at the back of her throat.

But she set the letter down on Nagisa&#39;s desk, next to the colorful 
letter she&#39;d already set down. She turned, her lips pursed, and sat 
determinedly down in her own chair, hands going mechanically to her 
letter opener. The blade flashed in the afternoon sun, temporarily 
dazzling her eyes. But her hands continued to move, slicing open her own 
envelopes.

She read the contents of her own letters in perfunctory fashion &#150; she 
already knew what was in them, they wrote nearly the same thing every 
year. Oh, how old she was getting! Oh, how graceful she was becoming! 
And had she found any nice young men? And, then, perhaps a teasing 
reference to St. Miator&#39;s reputation as the &quot;school of brides&quot; &#150; but it 
was impossible to take humor from it when she knew they were wishing for 
it to be so.

She sighed, and shut her eyes, pressing her hands firmly down on the 
unfolded letters. They did not expect college, even if her parents did. 
And even her parents expected rapid marriage to directly follow. Even at 
such a distance, she could already detect the inevitable disappointment; 
entering a female into the family registry did not seem like something 
that would appeal to her traditional family.

Boys and men were something she had never developed an interest in. As a 
child, she had happily played house sans males, her voice chirping that 
the lack of a boy to play a husband was not a problem at all. She had 
always begged for the manga with the pretty girls, eyes stretching down 
their length, taking in the artful clothing and pleasant curves. She 
disliked the male form for this &#150; it was all sharp points and angles, no 
softly sloping joints.

It wasn&#39;t that she disliked boys, per say, just... well, she didn&#39;t find 
them particularly attractive or emotionally satisfying. Girls whispered 
secrets and giggled and shared close moments; boys were mostly distant 
or teasing. They could share their own moments, but generally these were 
marred by violence. Girls were just so much more... wonderful.

She absentmindedly traced the female form with her hands. She had found 
it odd when female classmates began giggling about boys instead of 
candy. Before then, she had noticed no difference between herself and so 
many of her female classmates. At the end of elementary school she had 
asked her best friend if they would be the closest of friends forever &#150; 
and the girl had replied that, no, some day her husband would be closer. 
She remembered herself flinching back slightly, although the other girl 
didn&#39;t notice; instead, she blushed and laughed suddenly, and wondered 
aloud what her husband would be like. Tamao hadn&#39;t seen the girl since.

Even at Astraea, Tamao felt herself as slightly apart &#150; romance between 
girls was somewhat common, but with so many of them it seemed only 
temporary. Many of these girls even smirked, winking while stating that 
they were &quot;lesbian until graduation&quot;. They still thought of wedding 
dresses &#150; to them, their &quot;girlfriends&quot;, if they could be called that, 
were simply substitutes for the boyfriends they&#39;d have if school 
policies weren&#39;t so strict.

Tamao occasionally dreamt of wedding dresses &#150; but two of them, and lots 
of lace, and no cologne. And when she thought of wedding nights, there 
was never any risk of pregnancy involved.

The door banged open, and Tamao was drawn abruptly out of her thoughts, 
her head snapping to the noise. Nagisa burst in, cheerful demeanor 
instantly flooding the room. Tamao smiled &#150; she couldn&#39;t help it.

&quot;Ta-maooo!&quot;

&quot;Hello, Nagisa.&quot;

&quot;Oo, you picked up the mail!&quot; The girl had crossed the room, flinging 
her bag down on her bed as she went, and now she grasped the two 
letters. She read the crayon address first, &quot;Aw, Touya sent me a letter! 
He must&#39;ve finished learning his hiragana.&quot;

She flipped to the next letter, and there was a silence. Her face 
settled into a more serious smile, a content look only achieved when one 
is certain of their relationships. She settled into her own chair, 
carefully pulling the flap open, and drew out the letter. A faint hint 
of lavender floated on the air.

Tamao&#39;s back stiffened slightly, and she turned back to her own desk, 
staring at the picture frame before her. A year younger version of 
herself stood there, arm looped through the arm of a red-haired girl, 
the one who was still only a few feet and a million miles away. Her own 
face was pressed against Nagisa&#39;s shoulder, right hand grasping Nagisa&#39;s 
own left. Nagisa looked somewhat bewildered, and she could almost see 
the confused blinking the camera had been unable to capture. Their black 
uniforms were outlined against the blue sky, crisp in their early 
semester form.

Behind her, a letter was set down on Nagisa&#39;s desk, crinkling softly 
against the wooden surface. &quot;Shizuma is coming to visit me soon &#150; she&#39;s 
been very busy because it&#39;s her first year at college, but she says she 
has time the second Sunday from now.&quot;

Nagisa was more mature now. She was not mature by any means, but there 
was less of a childish edge to her personality now than there had been 
even just a year prior. Tamao tipped her head, bangs obscuring her eyes, 
&quot;Oh &#150; well, that should be fun.&quot;

Nagisa bounded upwards, her chair rocking back violently, and spun 
impulsively on the spot, &quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot; She stopped and looked suddenly 
at the closet and the bureau, &quot;Oh, I wonder what I&#39;ll wear? And do you 
think I have to get permission from the sister? Or is it okay because 
she only just graduated?&quot;

Tamao turned around, forcing a smile, &quot;Well, I suppose you should ask 
Tsubomi &#150; I&#39;m sure she knows the rules even for Miator, after all!&quot;

Nagisa grinned back, &quot;I bet she does!&quot; She left her desk, happily 
pushing in the chair, &quot;I&#39;m gonna go tell Hikari and Yaya!&quot; She started 
to leave the room, quickly pulling the door open before skidding to a 
halt, &quot;Oh!&quot; She turned back, &quot;Will we have dinner together tonight?&quot;

&quot;Of course, Nagisa &#150; always.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Tamao! You&#39;re such a good friend!&quot; The door shut, and the girl 
was gone from view. Tamao looked at the shut pine.

&quot;Yes, always...&quot;</pre>
