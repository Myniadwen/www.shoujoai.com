<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It would appear that Amane/Koike  Kaname/Momomi as BAD ENDING. Just without the boat. Oh, well.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Don’t fuck with me! I want  answers, now, and if I have to shove your pretty face through the  hedge to get them that’s just fine.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there something  wrong, Kenjou-san? You appear a little agitated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Last warning,”  Kaname said with deceptive softness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scary.” Koike  raised her hands. “Well, I don’t know what’s going on, but I  suppose I can tell you my part in this. My conversation with  Amane-chan yesterday was very limited, though. Pleasantries at best,  rudeness at worst… with a singular exception.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A singular  exception?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I took her aside for  a few minutes and decided to give my old friend a bit of advice.”  Koike raised a finger happily. “I told her she was wasting her time  being so reserved and cold. I told her she should stop messing around  and get closer to Phareli-san, already. And I said it was pretty  obvious she was attracted to the girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said what?”  Kaname shouted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. I said  she should hurry and advance her relationship with Phareli-san. But  Amane-chan denied everything, of course. She said she had nothing  more than a passing interest in the girl.” Koike turned away,  staring at the roses again. “Amane-chan has always been a very bad  liar, though. I think I’m right here. Even if I’m not, something  interesting is beginning…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stepped forwards,  grabbing the girl’s hair and twisting it slightly. “You know,  it’s interesting, but there’s no one else here. You should know  that.” She pulled Koike’s head back, staring into the girl’s  eyes. “So why don’t you take the time to tell me why I shouldn’t  rip your fat little head off and kick it into the lake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think?”  Koike asked calmly. “You should know the situation better than me.  Even I can’t know whether I’ve been useful or damaging for you  without that information.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi is pissed  beyond belief, because there’s something Amane’s not telling her,  and Amane said it had nothing to with her, and that makes her feel  like she’s already completely wasted her time.” Kaname glared.  “And that’s damaging our relationship, as well! The more annoying  Amane gets, the more Momomi makes it her problem and tries to fix it!  And that’s your fault, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, basically, my  advice has made Amane-chan become more distant from Phareli-san…  how cruel of her. But then again, she’s always been a contrary kind  of girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blinked. “Even  if you say that, though-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s why I said  that. If I was to say, ‘stay away from Phareli-san’, Amane would  dismiss me as her jealous ex who didn’t even get to be an ex. This  way, she’ll become agitated and try to distance herself from the  one she is attracted to. She’s extremely predictable in that  respect.” Koike smiled wistfully. “Of course she’ll always do  the opposite of what I say is best for her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could care less  about that! Your meddling has seriously screwed things up for me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How? In what way?”  Koike glanced at her, forehead wrinkling. “Even if I say that  wasn’t my intention, you won’t believe me. But it wasn’t my  intention, and in any case a more distant Amane is all the better for  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sure speak with  the benefit of a wonderful hindsight, but things didn’t have to  turn out this way,” Kaname said, slightly more calmly. She released  the girl’s hair. “If you’re even telling the truth about what  you said, of course. But while you’re sitting here pulling strings  in an ivory tower, I’m dealing with this crap in the real world!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If Amane took my  advice, it would provoke her to take further action and trigger a  contest she would lose and you would win. This way, though, she  alienates Phareli-san and you will still win. The only negative  outcome, from my perspective, would be if she didn’t do anything at  all. I told you before, didn’t I? Things as they are the worst for  me, you, them and everyone involved. I’d rather have a decisive  rupture.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Momomi  said something like that. Right before she left. </em>“And  that’s your decision to make, is it? You and your fucking  arrogance, sitting here and claiming you control us all! What gives  you the right to decide?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have no right, of  course. I made a choice for my own selfish motives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you admit-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But! But that’s  fine.” Koike glanced at her. “Even if I have very complicated  logic, all I did was offer an old friend a single piece of advice.  And, if I were a good friend, I would also give Amane that advice. I  haven’t done anything wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So this chaos is  fine, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If there is chaos,  that would definitely be an over-reaction to what I said.” Koike  chuckled. “It’s nice, actually. It looks like Amane-chan still  cares about what I say after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re saying you  weren’t hoping for your ‘decisive rupture’ after all?” Kaname  demanded, eyes narrowing. “Start making sense! It would be nice if  you spoke consistently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what can I say?  This wouldn’t be enough to make stable people change drastically.”  Koike shrugged. “None of us are stable, though. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And so now  destabilising people is sensible, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes, yes. What  do you think, Kenjou-san?” Koike turned to face her. “Phareli-san,  your girlfriend, and the singular girl with the interest of  Amane-chan… the rumours get more interesting every day. Wouldn’t  you be happier if she was just your girlfriend, no more?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not,”  Kaname replied. “Momomi can have whatever friends she likes-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Koike  asked, disinterest riding on her voice. “Well, that’s fine, then.  If you don’t care then the answer is simple.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know what’s  happened, because someone is dodging the question, but I do know one  thing. Amane-chan can resolve it, most likely, by being honest with  herself and Phareli-san. You, too, though, can resolve it by being  honest with Phareli-san, and telling her everything I’ve told you.”  Koike stuck her hands in her pockets. “That’s nice and simple,  isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You make everything  sound very clear-cut, don’t you?” Kaname demanded.  “Unfortunately, the truth isn’t some magical sword that will cut  through relationship problems just like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite. It’s  often the opposite, naturally. But that’s hardly the point. If you  really aren’t worried about Amane you have options. But I wouldn’t  be so casual.” Koike looked at the roses, rubbing a finger against  the palm of her other hand. “I told you before, but Amane-chan is  an unfortunate rival for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not afraid of  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why were you so  agitated just now? Surely there would be no ‘chaos’ if there was  ‘nothing to fear’?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Temporary arguments  aren’t the same thing as a broken relationship. I’ll be fine. But  I’d still be even better without you wreaking everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, all I did  was provide some advice. Don’t forget that.” Koike shook her head  irritably. “But wouldn’t it be even better still if Amane wasn’t  bothering you two at all? I thought you hated her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course I hate  her,” Kaname growled. “And of course I hate having her near  Momomi. But that’s got nothing to do with anything, as Momomi would  hate me if I forced the issue. That kinda defeats the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? So you aren’t  constrained by morals as such, but rather a fear of Phareli-san’s  hatred.” Koike glanced at her. “And how about the alternative?  What if someone could make Amane separate herself from Phareli-san  without ever implicating you at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing in this world  is that clean. And while we’re on the subject, you shouldn’t  pretend to be some kind of philanthrope.” Kaname smirked. “You  just want another chance at Amane, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wrong. My chances of  being with Amane are zero now. That’s done with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what else is motivating you? A  pure and selfless love? Do you want her to be happy?” Kaname  laughed out loud. “Don’t make me sick. Someone like you had  better not lay claim to a motive that pure, especially when your  actions don’t even make sense…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, of course. I’m  not being kind. Quite the opposite. Just because I’m not trying to  seduce her, that doesn’t mean I want other girls to get close to  her. The Perez girl wasn’t anything special; she’s always had  people like that. But Phareli is different. That’s why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a pretty  stupid attitude, isn’t it? So you want your loved one to be  miserable?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike shrugged. “She  may not be happy from what I do. I doubt it will make her miserable.  But if we’re truthful, is this really going to make her happy? Even  if she steals Phareli-san from you, that won’t please her. If she  fails, it will be even worse, and I’m sure she’ll fail. And the  equilibrium is worst of all. Watching you two and all your friends,  when she’s always alone…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. Is that  actually your reason, though? Or are you just justifying yourself in  ways that make you sound good? If that’s the case, it’s all  irrelevant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike nodded. “You’re  right, of course. My actual reason isn’t like that. It doesn’t  make sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You haven’t made  sense since I got here. So shoot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s hard to  put into words, but Amane is herself. I’d rather she remained an  untouchable goddess, forever.” Koike laughed. “As if that makes  sense, I know. I’m very cruel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Kaname  frowned. “But it makes sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? That’s nice  to know. But do you know why I think like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re going to  tell me, undoubtedly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I couldn’t  reach her at all. So it would make me feel a lot better if she never  returned anyone’s feelings, and always remained alone. If I’m  like that, I won’t compare myself over and over to her girlfriend,  wondering what it is I lack…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I don’t know.  Tough one that. A conscience? A sense of proportion? Empathy?  Sanity?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  glib. But comparing myself to other people isn’t <em>my</em>style.” Koike smiled. “But Amane-chan is  not a kind person, either. If she’s lonely, that doesn’t  displease me. She certainly didn’t stop to consider my feelings  when she threw me out before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you  complaining about now? You talk too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right. Now  you talk to me? Why are you threatening me? What chaos have I caused?  Why are you so agitated?” Koike glanced at her, eyes amused. “Do  tell, Kenjou-san. You’ve been defensive for long enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s got nothing to  do with you,” Kaname muttered, looking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I caused it, didn’t  I? That’s a good qualification, if you ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you caused  it, you’re still in your ivory tower. I’m the one who’s  involved. So you just stay here and do nothing while I go out and  solve this damn problem myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that’s your  attitude, is it? Fine, I’ll guess.” Koike glanced at her.  “Amane-chan is being defensive and that means Phareli-san is  increasingly considering that her problem. As a result, she’s  expending more and more effort on Amane, not you. That’s right,  isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I admitted that much  yourself. No need for too much pride.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, that  proves your casualness earlier was a lie. If jealousy can instil such  passion in you, you definitely care about whether or not Amane and  Momomi spend time together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t give a damn  if it’s in a general sense. That’s fine. But when Momomi’s  wasting her time and effort on a girl who snubs her, insults her and  is barely civilised at best, outright hostile at worst, instead of  keeping up with one of the only times I spend with her in the day…  that’s when I give a damn. It just pisses me off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. Well, that  isn’t surprising. From your perspective, Amane-chan is bad for  Phareli, right? Just as Amane regards you as bad for Phareli, she  said as much to me, even if it wasn’t in so many words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. As if I’m  surprised by that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s the  kind of situation that will resolve itself eventually. You can tell  Phareli-san what is wrong or not, as you please. It has nothing to do  with me.” Koike glanced at her. “Alternately, Amane can tell  Phareli, as I said before. If that happens, the very fact that she  has overcome her fear and mistrust of others will mean I’ll be  satisfied. And that, for once, is a genuine sentiment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “That  has nothing to do with me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s correct.  I’ll leave it in your hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t do  anything from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I haven’t done  anything yet. And I don’t make any promises, either. I don’t take  your orders, Kenjou-san. But for now, I’ll just see how things turn  out.” Koike folded her arms, smiling. “How about you? Are you  going to let this all recede nicely? Or do you actually want a  struggle after all? Can you tell me, Kenjou-san? What do you really  want from this situation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That has  nothing to do with you.” Kaname glared. <em>Those  words are being used far too much in recent times…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Well, if you ever need  any support, come and see me. We have mutual interests, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll go without.  Just tell me one thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why would Amane be so  bothered by the things you say? She doesn’t give a damn about  people. You know her somehow, I’ve worked out that, but how?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really were  inattentive when you were younger… or perhaps you really did have  eyes for no one but Amane. We’ve seen each other before, though. I  had longer hair, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “Longer  hair?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re hopeless.”  Koike sighed. “The story is a simple and boring one. A shorter,  long-haired girl fell for a taller, handsome girl. The troublesome  thing was that they were roommates and friends, close friends, best  friends, so she knew that confessing would ruin their friendship. It  grew in her and grew in her, though, the things that she left  unspoken, until they burst.” Koike cocked her head. “Sound  familiar?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a little…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  Amane-chan rejected me. But I don’t mean that she simply rejected  me. I mean she <em>rejected </em>me,  everything about me, my feelings and my friendship and everything we  had in common. Eventually, we were given different rooms. That’s  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No wonder you bear a  grudge. But wouldn’t it be easier to give up? Isn’t it just a  little sad to cling onto this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps. But this  way, I get to see interesting things. In any case, even if we’re  apart now, she still listens to me, because I know everything about  her. I understand Amane. I know ten thousand times as much as  Phareli-san does, Amane’s past and her present and her thoughts and  her feelings… all of it. I was that kind of friend.” Koike  chuckled. “But that’s why she sent me away, I think. She didn’t  want to have to face that kind of person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Kaname  folded her arms. “Well, you don’t exist in a vacuum. Nor can you  just do what you like. If you get in my way any more, you’ll pay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I don’t take  your orders.” Koike chuckled. “I’m sure Phareli-san would say  the same thing. So, good afternoon, Kenjou-san. There isn’t all  that much of lunchtime left…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you should be  careful.” Kaname turned and began to walk away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be watching  your future actions with great interest. Everything is in your hands,  Kenjou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking  about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, this is your  game to lose. You have a winning hand, so unless you make a mistake  that will be that… unless you choose to fold. This conflict isn’t  strictly necessary. But it might, perhaps, be desirable for you. I’ll  leave that decision to you as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you? What  are you going to do?” Kaname demanded. “You’re planning  something, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Not really. I’m  just playing things by the ear.” Koike smirked. “It’s  interesting, isn’t it? Even if I say nothing but small things, I  can cause events to snowball spectacularly… it’s quite the  thrill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “You’re  a chessplayer, aren’t you? Just prodding us here or there, as you  like? Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. I prefer the  term puppeteer. I don’t mean that in a malicious way, or one  implying too much control. No, perhaps animal tamer is the best term.  You three will act very freely, I just add new stimuli and see  whether you react in the right way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s lips formed a  small smile. “That’s fun, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little, yes. At the  very least, it kills my boredom.” Koike frowned. “But I really  have done very little, after all. I just enjoy my position as a  spectator on this muddle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But your logic is far  too grand for that, of course. That’s more than a mere spectator.  You’d like to influence us all in the ways that please you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Is that  unusual?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. But most people  don’t go this far.” Kaname closed her eyes and folded her arms,  shrugging theatrically. “But you know, you remind me of someone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi, before she  met me.” Kaname glanced at her, crimson eyes impassive. “She was  bored and lonely and manipulative and had very grand theories about  everything and everyone. She said she enjoyed standing apart and  playing games with people, and arranged some very convoluted traps.  She also claimed that she was a non-entity, a personality who became  whatever she needed to be. But that’s a little too grand for her.  The truth is that she was mostly a slightly smug, very smart girl who  played little games with people. She said that was her happiness,  insofar as she had any.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t  compare her with me, you know. It isn’t anything close to like with  like.” Koike smirked. “Of course, I could count the ways in which  you are like Amane-chan… but there wouldn’t be much point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But at the end of the  day, Momomi wasn’t particularly inhuman. She was a very real and  vulnerable girl, ignored by most people. And even if she said she was  happy, she was just sad and lonely. I know for a fact that her  manipulations only increased her own sense of distance, and she’s  retooled and downscaled them ever since she gained friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t lecture me.  I’m not interested in your stupid assumptions…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Assumptions?”  Kaname asked. “Who said anything about assumptions? I’m just  talking about Momomi, who I know. Don’t you want to know more about  her, the girl who captured Amane’s heart?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know more than  enough already. I’m not interested in any limited insight you could  bring to bear… you’re far too obtuse for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like her, you’re  almost cute when you’re defensive.” Kaname stuck her hands in her  pockets. “Well, whatever. Do what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The same to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just don’t get too  caught up in hanging around rose gardens and playing around with  people who don’t really care for you. Yuho, at least, has your  back. There are worse people for someone like you, remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike chuckled. “You’ll  have to come a very long way indeed before you can think of giving me  advice, Kenjou. When you’ve sorted out your own messed-up life and  know more than a few sentences about me, we can talk. In the  meantime, you should be more like yourself. A snake without her fangs  won’t ever triumph, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. Happy hunting, or  whatever it is you do here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  walked away, frowning deeply. <em>Yeah…a snake  without fangs, huh? What does that make her? A hawk without claws? I  can’t even hate someone like that. She’s altogether too  miserable. But that’s not my problem. If people choose to live that  way, it can’t be helped. I should know. I’m the same kind of  person.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi drew  her blazer tighter about her as she trudged through the school  grounds, looking down miserably. She shivered. <em>It’s  cold out. It’s definitely way too cold out. I guess this really is  winter after all. </em>A couple of first year  students ran past her, heading somewhere in a great hurry. <em>The  library? No, that’s the wrong way. The Church? Whatever. They’re  way too noisy, wherever they’re going and however important it is.</em>Momomi scowled at the thought, glancing up  irritably at winter’s mediocre sunlight. <em>I’m  lucky, because I don’t have to go through the pain and  embarrassment of remembering when I was like that at school. You  didn’t run in the Phareli household, after all. Phareli move  slowly, with dignity and grace. Even their children, it’s an  inviolable thing. Children should be quiet, studious, well-educated,  graceful, polite and clean. In short, children should be miniature  adults that grow into proper adults by the way of growing adults.  What’s childhood, then? Is it merely the span of time dividing  birth from puberty? Or does that word imply some kind of release from  responsibility? I didn’t know at the time, of course, but even my  hobbies were guided by the proprietary of the Phareli. Araldo can  learn about business and suchlike, but the girls should paint and  write poetry like good little girls. Too bad Luigia is the competent  one. But nonetheless, when I remember that, I can’t help but envy  those girls just now. How many of them are like me, and using this  place as a release? How many of them are normal? Do they know how  lucky they are? I wonder…about a lot of things.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What am  I talking about? Don’t joke around. </em>Momomi  looked upwards, forcing a smile on her face. <em>How  ridiculous. There’s no point in recalling such things now. What my  childhood is like doesn’t matter, because it won’t excuse  anything. I’m intelligent enough to make my own decisions and I am  who I am. I can take responsibility. Kaname too, even if she had an  even worse childhood than me in quite the opposite manner to my  own…</em>Momomi sighed. <em>But  that’s even more irrelevant. Kaname shouldn’t have said those  things. It’s way too troublesome. Her hatred of Amane is just  unreasonable, as was her attitude, when it was only a single meeting  anyway. She’s way too clingy, however I look at it. I may be her  first true friend, but that’s still no excuse… and she was my  first true friend, too, but that’s got nothing to do with it. I  don’t ask for too much. I don’t ask for much at all. Well, I have  my expectations as a girlfriend, but I also need more space than  she’s willing to give me. And she doesn’t properly consider my  feelings, either. If she was more sensitive and considerate, these  things wouldn’t happen in the first place. It’s not my fault. I  have nothing to do with it. I just have something important to do,  that’s all. I always support her when she has something to do, such  as opposing Amane, even though it doesn’t really make me happy…it’s  important to her. But that’s Kaname for you, isn’t it? Half the  time, she holds on tighter than an elephant on an Apache. The rest of  the time, she fixates on Amane so badly it’s like I don’t even  exist. And I never complain about that, do I? Why do I have to look  at no one but her, all the time? Is that fair on me? </em>Momomi  sighed miserably. <em>Why does it always turn out  this way? It doesn’t make me happy at all. How about her? Does she  care? Is she as tough as she’s supposed to be after all? Yeah,  right. I’ve never believed that. Is she still mad? Is she still  hurt? Is she sorry? I don’t know. She’ll never tell me. What am I  supposed to do?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shook her head hurriedly, trying to clear her chaotic thoughts. <em>I  don’t need this. I have to focus. I have to sort out things with  Amane, first. That’s the point, isn’t it? Though now I’m more  annoyed about all the things Kaname said to me, but that’s not the  point. Besides, if I don’t achieve something like this there  wouldn’t be a decent reason to have an argument in the first place.  I need to focus. </em>Momomi rubbed her eyes,  sighing deeply. <em>And did she really say ‘I  love you?’ or that kind of thing? I didn’t imagine that, did I?  Why would Kaname ever say that? But it makes me feel even more  rotten… that’s enough. It’s not my fault. I don’t have  anything to be ashamed of! </em>Momomi chuckled  ironically. <em>Or not, whatever. Guilt can keep  for now, I have things to do.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane was in the stables.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As  always. Amane is always in the stables; Kaname is always in our room.  I have very predictable friends. </em>Momomi  looked inside, finding Amane kneeling in front of one of the horses  and doing something odd with its foot. “Am I interrupting  anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced up  briefly, her eyes widening, then she looked down again. “Somewhat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat? What kind  of answer is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m busy. But if  you aren’t too intrusive, I can manage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, aren’t you  gracious?” Momomi demanded sarcastically. She felt a little better  at that. Being mildly annoyed with Amane was a lot easier than  exploring her other emotions right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was rhetorical.”  Momomi sighed, walking across the stable and smiling at Sol as she  neighed in recognition. “What are you doing, anyway? Checking them  for athlete’s foot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just checking them.  No hoof, no horse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “As  conscientious as ever… what is the school going to do when you  leave?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They can find another  enthusiast. But why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No particular  reason,” Momomi muttered, stroking Sol’s neck. “Do I need one  now? This isn’t your property.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is the first  time, that’s all. Isn’t Kenjou getting annoyed by now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that got to  do with anything?” Momomi replied, more confidently than she  actually felt. “She can get a little annoyed. It’s not a problem.  How about you? After you didn’t ride earlier, are you still telling  me there’s nothing wrong? That’s the first time as well…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m telling you no  more than I did earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which was nothing at  all.” Momomi sighed. “You’re so unbelievably frustrating… how  bad can it possibly be? Believe me, you should just say it now. Bad  rumours can be arranged.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t anything  important. I’ve just been in an introspective mood. But you have as  much to do with Koike as I do with Kenjou. It’s my private matter.  If you’re trying to intrude, that isn’t my concern. So forget  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t say  anything!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were going to.”  Amane released the horse’s leg and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t make  that right. And so what if I was? In case you haven’t noticed, I’m  trying to be a good friend to you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re too  persistent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What else am I  supposed to do, when you’re so stubborn?” Momomi demanded. “Have  you ever even looked at yourself? You’re alone! You don’t have  any friends at all. But if you keep being that defensive, you’ll  worry the people who do genuinely care about without having anyone  but your damned fangirls!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can make my own  decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course! But that  doesn’t mean you’re always right!” Momomi said heatedly. “If  I think you’re wrong, I’ll tell you. If I need to be persistent,  I’ll be persistent. That’s the point of me being a friend to you,  whether you like it or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that. But that  doesn’t have any bearing on matters between Koike and me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is the situation  between you two, anyway? At least tell me that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned. “How  much do you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing at all.  Someone hasn’t been telling me anything at all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, she used to be  my roommate. So I know her.” Amane picked up a brush and started to  groom the horse. “That’s all there is to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were her  roommate?” Momomi’s brow wrinkled. “Wait, when you say roommate  do you mean the-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s all there is  to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what does she want  with you? Is she trying to seduce you or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It has nothing to do  with you. I won’t let Koike trouble you when we’re together, but  I won’t let you go behind her back either. What’s between us is  between us. No more and no less. That’s all I have to say on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, whatever it is,  it’s obvious that it’s worrying you! Why can’t you tell me  anything at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s be  troublesome. What would be the point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if I told you,  nothing changes. So why should I describe it to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because it’ll make  you feel better, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like hell you are!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if I’m not,  it’s my call to make. It doesn’t have anything to do with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what do I have to  do to make it to do with me?” Momomi shouted. “What more do you  want me to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced at her,  puzzled. “Why are you bothered? It isn’t your problem, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you get it?  It’s because I’m your friend, or rather I’m trying to be your  friend, only you don’t trust me at all… I want to be someone you  can talk to but I’m failing miserably, and I’m not sure what it  is I’m doing wrong… and you don’t even care.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I appreciate that.  But this isn’t something I can talk about, regardless of  circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? I see. That’s  good.” Momomi looked down, fists balling. “So I completely wasted  me time coming here? That’s just wonderful…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there something  wrong? You don’t look well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, there’s nothing  wrong. Of course not. I’m fine.” Momomi leaned on the door,  avoiding Amane’s stare. “Even if I did have a problem, it  wouldn’t have anything to do with you, right? It wouldn’t be  something I’d tell you about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so… but  you don’t look well at all.” Amane frowned. “You should worry  about yourself, not me. I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up. You don’t  even have the right to worry about me any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not happy about  this or anything. But you wouldn’t want to know anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to know! But  that’s not the point! I want you to want me to know!” Momomi  glared at her. “But that’s impossible, I know that now. Even if I  come here after that row, nothing changes… Kaname was right. It’s  completely pointless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re crying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am not crying!”  Momomi shouted, rubbing her eyes. “And in any case, it has nothing  to do with you! I’m just sick of this feeling! You kick me around  however you like, and Kaname’s no different!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou?” Amane took  a step forwards, frowning dangerously. “What has she done to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing to do  with you,” Momomi muttered, looking in the opposite direction.  “Forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If she’s been  hurting you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up! It’s your  fault anyway!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t care about  that,” Amane said. “What has she done to you? She’s the person  who should always be kind to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t make me  laugh. Nothing’s that convenient. We had a row, that’s all. Over  whether I came or went this lunchtime, thanks to a certain stubborn  rider…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You had an argument?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. We’re  real people, thanks, not any crappy romance novels you’ve read. And  for that matter, we argued about you again. I’m just sick and tired  of it all… it’s like I can’t do anything right with you two any  more.” Momomi rested her forehead against the wood. “Not just you  two, even. Olesa and Amiki might be leaving the school, I haven’t  seen the Etoiles in a while and Shion’s busy with the play. It’s  not fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s Kaname who  hurts me the most. Sometimes he makes no sense to me at all. She’s  sometimes careless, sometimes overprotective, she’s impatient and  clingy and stubborn and she gets angry easily, and I can’t back  down either. So we end up having these stupid rows, for the sake of  our own egos. And because she never, ever apologises, I don’t even  know what she thinks of me after those times…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at her,  shocked. “What are you saying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m asking why you  are here. If you’re arguing with Kenjou, that should be your worry.  She’s your girlfriend, isn’t she?” Amane glared. “So don’t  waste your time here with me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you care  about anything that I do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My feelings are  irrelevant, aren’t they?” Amane walked forwards swiftly, standing  in front of Momomi and grabbing her shoulders. “Look at me!”  Momomi looked up, her eyes filled with tears. “Get a sense of  perspective! If you’re coming here to talk to me for ridiculous  reasons when you should be with her, even I won’t forgive you!  Making up with her is what will give you happiness, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking  about-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You heard me! But  I’ll repeat it. Kenjou is more important than me. She’s more  important to you, and she cares a lot more about you than I do. So  it’s obvious, isn’t it?” Amane looked down at her with intense  red eyes. “She’s the one you like. That’s where your commitment  lies, so stop playing around!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just because she’s  my girlfriend, that doesn’t mean I can’t be something else to  anyone else! I want to be your friend!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I want to be your  friend, but I don’t know if that’s possible. Kenjou comes first,  Koike is important to me in a strange way, and life isn’t  convenient… and I’m not a good person, so forget it.” Amane  took a deep breath, relaxing slightly and smiling. “But if you  can’t even please her, why would anyone else like you? You’re  hurt, she’s hurt too, so go to her again. Isn’t that obvious,  idiot? Everything else follows on from that, and even if you have to  sacrifice everything else, at least you’ll have something… the  most important thing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi hugged her  tightly, burying her face in Amane’s shoulder. “That’s enough…  shut up already… you’re annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked at the  ceiling. “So this is what it feels like. Not happy, is it?”</span></p>
