<div><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  didn’t like Araldo Phareli. She gazed at him with slightly hostile eyes  and reflected on just how much she didn’t like him. <em>It’s not  exactly a rational characteristic, but those girlish features, that  effete hairstyle, his accented voice, his casual presumption, the  problem he presents Serané, the annoyance he is to Momomi, they’re all  ways in which he irritates me. So I’m certainly not looking forwards to  having lunch with him. </em>Her frown deepened. <em>That said, I’m also  feeling a little annoyed with Luigia right now, as well, even though  she’s the one I can at least tolerate, out of all of them. I suppose  it’s because lunch should be a time between Momomi and I. Shion I can  tolerate, Olesa and Amiki too if I really must, but not these two. I  can’t speak freely with Momomi in front of them, though I can with the  others, and being able to talk with Momomi is enjoyable. They’re  intruding on that. Then again, it’s not like I can’t talk to her for  hours after school, but we tend to sit in silence a lot at those times.  It- bothers me all the same, though, that these two are here. I’m not  quite sure why.</em></span>
    <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, what do you make of Serané, Araldo?” Momomi asked, picking through her bento.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s a charming and well-bred girl. And she has a fascinating personality.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  that’s a Phareli talking,” Momomi teased. “I want to know what the  teenage boy called Araldo thinks. It won’t go any further than here, my  friends are reliable.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo gave Kaname a dubious look, which made her scowl. <em>Oi! Go glare at Olesa and Amiki too, they’re right there! Impudent bastard! </em>“Are you sure this is the right tone, Momomi?” Kaname asked, frowning. “This is a serious matter.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be so serious, Kaname,” Momomi said, smiling. “I just want a pleasant chat, not a business meeting.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if I’m speaking frankly, Serané-san is… what’s the term…” Araldo  frowned. “Can we speak in Italian now? This is a strain.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When in Rome, do as Romans do,” Momomi quoted.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  Romans are keener on that axiom when they are in Rome,” Kaname noted,  managing to recognise the English. “It’s just a way of saying to do  what’s convenient for the locals. All the same, I don’t like being cut  out of conversations.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo raised his hands. “That wasn’t my  intention, I can assure you! I’m just not very comfortable with my  Japanese. I can’t say I’m as well-spoken in it as my cousins.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s for sure,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname!”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  doing very well,” Olesa assured him. “Please carry on. Serané-sama is  an important person to us, so we are interested in your opinions. It  would be a shame if you weren’t compatible as personalities.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Scary… now we’re serious again,” Araldo joked.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it is a matter of marriage.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so,” Araldo said. “That’s why I should be honest, I know. But I  was struggling to find the right word. I’ve got it now. Serané’s very  cute.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cute?” Momomi looked startled.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, cute,” Araldo  said uneasily, rubbing the back of his head and chuckling. “Sounds a  little weak of me, doesn’t it? But she’s… I don’t know… there’s  something about her manner that makes you want to hold her, you know?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my,” Luigia said, sounding amused. “Young love… you’re gabbing, cousin, and it’s rather embarrassing.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry,” Araldo said, waving a hand. “I guess that came out strange, but  what I meant to say, is that she has a very endearing personality. I  was worried, when I came here, that I wouldn’t be able to stand her.  She could be my wife, after all. I’d hate it if she were a strait-laced  snob. But she’s a humble and unassuming personality, so I was really  very relieved.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I should warn you,” Momomi said. “She may  appear like that, but she can be quite snobbish at times. She’s told me  so herself.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, she didn’t come across that way to me,”  Araldo said. “And she’s a good conversationalist, too. We got on very  well and talked about a lot of different things. Her opinions can be a  little simplistic, but-”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s another thing. I mean, she’s not very bright, if I’m being frank.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course, but that doesn’t make her a bad person,” Araldo replied. “I didn’t expect you to be so judgmental, Momomi.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not what I meant, but I’m just saying… you should be judgmental, you’re  going to be married to her. Forever.” Momomi snorted. “This isn’t a  time to say that anyone will do. You should be choosy.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know  that, but my first impression of her was positive. She’s beautiful,  charming and with a pleasant manner.” He frowned slightly at some  memory. “Her friend seems a little scary, though.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There’s a lot of irony in this conversation </em>Kaname reflected. <em>Trust  Serané to screw up this badly…boys like empty-headed personas like  that. It makes them feel strong, important protectors, and bolsters  their egos. But a clueless girl who hasn’t met a boy in years wouldn’t  know that. </em>“There’s something you should know about that friend, though, if you mean Kariya-sama.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Araldo asked. “What’s that?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s Serané’s girlfriend. So don’t be too surprised if she’s being a little prickly.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname…” Momomi said, surprised and slightly annoyed.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I believe in the direct approach,” Kaname said. “I’m not messing around.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Girlfriend? In what sense?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia  coughed. “Well, apparently there’s some rumour about her sexual  preferences, and those two. But I’m sure it’s just talking.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  isn’t just talk,” Momomi said. “I messed around for our parents,  because they’re idiots, but we can talk about this in a  straight-forwards manner. Serané’s gay and she’s been Kariya’s lover  for perhaps three years. I’m sorry, cousin.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo smiled slightly. “So they’ve been playing at a relationship, huh? That’s kinda cute.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naïve,  aren’t you,” Kaname said starkly. “I want you to imagine a newly  married couple who sleep in the same room in one large bed- I’ve seen  it- with three years at their disposal, and no need to go to work. I’m  sure you can grasp my inference.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surely not,” Luigia said. “I’ve come across this before. It’s as Araldo says, a game to pass the time.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sister!” Momomi looked shocked and slightly upset.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  they might pretend to be like that, but have you ever seen them in that  kind of situation?” Luigia asked. “It’s an attitude thing, a way of  attracting attention.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not in this case, I can assure you,” Momomi said. “We’ve seen them kiss.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only that?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course! They’re not perverted or anything, they don’t just do it in front of people!”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally.  I doubt they even kiss much in public, but they’d still let it be known  that they’re a couple. Like I said, it attracts attention.” Luigia  smiled. “You’re a little naïve, Momomi.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bang. Momomi stood and slammed a palm against the table. “What the hell do you know?” she shouted.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia  looked shocked for a moment, then recovered, looking round the canteen,  which quivered with shock at her words. “Momomi, please, you’re making  a scene…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why should I?” Momomi demanded. “I’m not the naïve one  here! Just because you don’t understand or like something, you pretend  it doesn’t exist… that’s worse than naivety, you’re in denial.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia flushed. “Do you really think that sort of thing is real?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you really think it doesn’t exist?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They stared at each other, at something of a stalemate.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo stood, laying a hand on Momomi’s arm. “Now, now, cousin… shall we just calm down?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smiled thinly. <em>Big mistake.</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  tore his arm off. “Be calm about what? Honestly, I can just about take  this kind of attitude from my parents, but you two have no excuse!”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  no one’s saying that they’re not undergoing… real experiences,” Araldo  began. “It’s just… a phase, you know? Something they’ll grow out of, so  you shouldn’t get so defensive.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t get it, do you?” Momomi said, looking between the two of them. “Do you actually believe this crap?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  far as I can tell, you’re the one who has been mislead,” Luigia said,  shaking her head slightly. “We’re being charitable, Momomi, please  understand that. I don’t intend to condemn these two girls.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is charity?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s wrong,” Luigia said, shrugging. “But I can understand their  reasons.” She gave Momomi a worried look. “I thought you knew that kind  of thing.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought you knew kind of thing,” Momomi said, leaning forwards. “I can’t believe you still use such outdated concepts!”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed and stood. “Shall we quieten things down a bit?” she suggested,  touching Momomi’s shoulder lightly. The girl looked at her with  infuriated eyes. “The whole room would support you anyway,” she said  softly. “Isn’t it more fun to do this properly?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed, sitting down and smoothing her features with perceptible effort.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sat down as well, leaning back slightly. “Shall we end this conversation here?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a good idea,” Araldo said, sounding relieved.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sisters said nothing, avoiding each other’s gazes. Kaname sighed audibly. <em>Oh,  great, tense atmosphere…well, this is what you get for taking such a  casual attitude at a school like this. If Luigia didn’t know the most  basic of Astraea’s characteristics, she can’t be a very good sister.  More to the point, how on earth did Momomi manage to write letters  avoiding the issue? Is that even possible at a school like this?</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  do you find Japanese food, Araldo-kun?” Olesa asked, her voice loud in  the silence. “Is it to your taste? I can speak from experience that  it’s quite, quite different from European food.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Yes, I  suppose it is…” Araldo forced a smile. “Actually, I quite like it. But  I must say, I haven’t got the hang of chopsticks. There must be a trick  to it, you’re all embarrassing me.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry about it,” Amiki  said. “We were the same when we arrived here. Look, I’ll show you.” She  began a demonstration. “Your grip is slightly wrong… you need to rest  it there, in between the fingers and thumb, but brace them with the  ring finger. It’s just the ring finger and the thumb involved.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like this?” Araldo asked, raising his hand. The sticks slipped in them. “Damnit…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, you need to hold it tighter. And keep them straight.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked sharply at Momomi, who was picking listlessly at her food. She  gave her sister a dark look for a moment, then looked away again. <em>Brooding. Brooding isn’t good for you. </em>She expertly picked up her umeboshi, holding it up. “Here.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just glared at her and shook her head.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did I look like I was giving you a choice?” Kaname asked. “Eat or I poke your eye out. The choice is yours.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes and ate the bitter fruit without a word.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yep,  bad mood. Well, I should have judged from that conversation before…  Momomi feels pretty strongly about this. It’s a bit surprising, I  always thought she was the apathetic type, but I suppose not. Just as  long as she doesn’t become an Etoile fangirl, she was walking the brink  there. But she looks pretty upset. </em>Kaname gave Luigia a brief glare, but the girl was simply eating without a word. <em>I  know why. I suppose if you stretch your definitions, this is what they  call betrayal. And one of the less pleasant aspects of this world, the  fact that an otherwise perfectly decent, upstanding person can say  stuff like…that. I mean, I don’t feel strongly about these things, but  it was demeaning. I suppose that’s an inevitable part of this school.  Talk about a liberal consensus… there’s this intrinsic solidarity in  the favour of homosexuals, not out of a slightly uncomfortable  correctness that you can find in some places, but a genuine belief, I  suppose. I imagine there have to be people like Araldo and Luigia here,  but they can’t voice their opinions very loudly, because of that. Of  course, where I come from, the opposite would be true for the most  part, and Momomi’s family is the same, and many other places and many  other people. But you could perhaps forget that in this school. In that  sense, too, we live in a dream world.</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was another slightly awkward silence. <em>The  sisters are still dead silent, Amiki looks slightly uncomfortable too,  Olesa has retreated into her tranquil doll-like shell…and I’m not going  to force myself to provide conversation. Actually, I can’t think of  anything either. Not good.</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was wondering, though,” Araldo began nervously. “Does anyone have any advice about Serané-san?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared at him, making him wilt visibly. “In what sense?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  impress her. We talked but I don’t really know too much about her and  since you all know her a lot better than me, I was wondering if you  could help me…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sex change operation,” Momomi muttered, her voice closer to Olesa’s than her usual amused chime.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It really pisses me off to hear her sound like that. It’s just…wrong.</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  impress Serané-sama…” Amiki said to bridge the silence. “I’m not sure.  Well, she likes strong people, as far as I can tell… I suppose you  should try to assert yourself. And don’t worry about offending her,  she’s far tougher than she looks. If you want to be her friend, then  just agreeing with her is fine, but-” Amiki contemplated the end of the  sentence and changed tack. “I think that goes for a lot of girls. If  you want to be their friends, maybe agreeing with them all the time  would be enough, but lovers need to be a little selfish as well. That’s  what I think.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you ever followed your own advice?” Kaname asked sarcastically.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve no time for such stupid things,” Amiki said. “I’m dedicated to oj-” she winced, “Olesa-san.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think I understand what you’re saying,” Araldo said, apparently  deciding to ignore the latter exchange. “But when I see her face like  that, it feels far too cruel to disagree with her.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said,  she won’t respect someone who thinks like that.” Amiki frowned. “It’s a  mark of respect to call someone out when they’re talking complete  nonsense.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo nodded. “That makes sense. Was there anything-”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Araldo-san.” Olesa’s voice was impassive.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  will not be welcome, but you should listen to Kiyashiki-san.” Olesa  gave him a dead-eyed stare. “Serané cannot love you. The best you can  hope for is a business arrangement. Beyond that, give it up.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo opened his mouth then stopped himself, momentarily disarmed by her flat tone.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  frowned at that expression. “I’ll elaborate. Even if you follow through  with such an arrangement, trying to sweeten it by attempting to make  her care for you will only hurt her. So take this as a trading matter.  If you cannot accept that, stop this now.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Araldo sighed. “So you think so too, huh?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do we put this?” Amiki reflected. “Everyone thinks so, pretty much. Anyone who knows her even a little.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t make it right,” Luigia said, looking up. “She’s still young… you’re all still young, very young, and-”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not again,” Momomi snapped.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Easy,” Kaname said warningly. “Momomi, listen. That’s enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  nodded. “If you two won’t accept our words, that’s your decision.  However, I would advise you to consider them seriously. For her sake  and your own.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was silence for a moment. Then Momomi spoke again. “That’s not enough, though. Because it’s not wrong.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi!” Luigia said.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not wrong,” Momomi said, more loudly, staring back at her sister. “And I’m not going to let you say that it is.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You two!” Kaname was about to stand and move between them when Olesa touched her shoulder briefly. “Huh?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let them be.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi… behaviour like that is a sin. You do understand that, right?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  I don’t understand that. I don’t understand how any loving God can say  that five percent of the population have no right to love.” Momomi  scowled, fingers clenching under the table. “But I don’t understand how  that God has anything relevant to say anyway.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take that back!” Luigia said, genuinely shocked.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  won’t. I won’t. I was never sure about God, but as I grew older, I grew  more certain. Even if he’s real, then I don’t want any part of his  kingdom.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname closed her eyes. <em>Oh, God. This just keeps getting better and better.</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This school has changed you.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  You’re the one who has changed. The sister I remember would never look  at me as if I disgust her. No matter what I believed.” Momomi wrapped  shaking hands round her upper arms.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not disgusted, Momomi, I’m just… surprised. A little shocked. Whatever you say, you have changed.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  a bad liar. But do you want me to tell the truth? Do you need to know  why me, of all people, should be so dubious about a God?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re a religious family, we always have been, and you too, so… why?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Religious?” Momomi snorted. “When you watch our father pray so earnestly to a God who commanded <em>Thou shalt not adulterate,</em> and our mother pray to a God who said that women should know their  place, and you pray to a God who said that a family was a sacred thing…  in that environment… it became difficult to believe. I was merely going  through the motions and no more years ago. I’m sorry to disappoint you,  sister, but I’ve never been a true believer.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think I’m  blind?” Luigia said. “I’m a child of our family, and I know everything  wrong with us, but I’ve always held onto my faith. You… you haven’t had  an easy life, Momomi, but I’ve had it worse. I’m the eldest and I’ve  tried to bear my duty, my responsibility. But you’ve always-” she  stopped.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say it,” Momomi instructed crisply.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  always run away,” Luigia said, glowering defiantly. “You’ve always just  done what you pleased and left me to make excuses and carry the burden  for you. You didn’t even do what little you had to do and now it’s come  to this.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Running away, is it?” Momomi’s face looked like it had  been carved out of stone, but the eyes were glistening. “Yes, you might  well see it that way. But I was walking away, and I am walking away.  That’s not easy, but you wouldn’t know that. You’ve accepted it all,  all that crap that’s your life. The duty, the religion, the beliefs and  the will of your father. You’ve never stood for anything, have you?  That’s running away.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I stood up for you,” Luigia replied. “Time  and time again, and it wasn’t easy! That was a mistake, though. I  should have let you stand on your own two feet.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, that’s the  way of our sublimely loving family,” Momomi replied. “No… I suppose you  don’t deserve that. I’m… I’m not ungrateful. But I’ve decided to stand  on my own two feet. Isn’t that what you want? I could care less if you  don’t like what I stand for. This is who I am.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luigia sighed. “Momomi…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The younger girl just folded her arms and stared back.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t need to pretend that our family’s perfect. But that doesn’t mean  you have to define your faith by them. My religion’s my own, Momomi,  not my father’s.” Luigia shrugged. “I’d assumed that you’d be the same…  I believe in it precisely because my life can be emotionally difficult.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can accept that, somewhat. But that doesn’t change my own feelings.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know, but it makes me worry. Just because our parents believe in  something, that doesn’t make it false. You shouldn’t define yourself as  the complete opposite of them, it’s just as forced as if you’re their  clones.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then you’re worse than me, because you’ve ostensibly  used independent thought but came to be a clone anyway,” Momomi said.  “Tell me one particular in which you differ from them, or gone against  this mystic duty, That’s what I hate. You just accept it all!”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Accepting  it is the mature thing to do. And I don’t define myself in terms of  them, like I said. In your words, this is who I am.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  nothing mature at all about accepting an imposed will. To me, anyway.  I’m through with it. That’s why I’m here and it’s why I want to stay  here.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not sure I can condone that any more. For your sake.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you don’t condone it, you’re being dishonest. You said you wanted me to  stand on your own two feet, and I’m doing that. I don’t want to be  dependent on my father, or on my mother, or and you standing up for me.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  something you should say when you’re far older,” Luigia said. “You’re  far too young to be talking about things like this.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again, you  can’t ignore my feelings because you disagree with them,” Momomi  snapped. “Serané’s love is real, whether you recognise it or not. And  that’s my resolve, whether you recognise it or not. It’s real to me.  The rest is you deciding whether you care enough to listen.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was another kind of echoing silence. <em>I  know this one. This is the silence people make when they know they’ve  said everything that can be said, but neither of them wants to walk  away. I should know, it happened often enough between my mother and I.  Now, how do I…</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you ride, Araldo-kun?” Olesa asked pleasantly.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Horses? Yeah, a little.” He smiled humbly. “I’m not very good, though. Do you?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite  well. I was wondering whether you might want to join me. I’m sure  Ohtori-san or one the senpais will be able to lend you a horse if we  asks nicely, they all own several.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That might be quite fun. I haven’t been for a while, I never seem to find the time for it.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  smiled. “I’m much the same, so we’ll both be out of our depth next to  Ohtori-san. However, that doesn’t stop us from enjoying a quick canter  round the paddock. It’s a pleasant enough pastime.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll go with  her, of course, but just to watch,” Amiki said, waving a hand. “I’ve  never been any good at it, and if we borrow too many there will be  raised eyebrows.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would two guests be too much?” Luigia asked.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  of course not,” Olesa said. “I can assure you. We are hospitable to our  guests, after all. I could lend you Ganymede, if it came to that,  though he’s not really mine to lend.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you keep your own horses on the premises?” Araldo inquired in a friendly way. “You sound quite enthusiastic, after all.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She rides so infrequently that the expense wouldn’t really be justified,” Amiki said. “How about you two?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi forced a smile. “I’m still not keen on riding. I might take a walk to settle my lunch.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me, too,” Kaname said instantly. “I’m sad to say I can’t ride at all. Never really seen the point.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Araldo said. “You should try it at some point, it is a very enjoyable experience.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t waste too much time talking to her when she gets like that,” Amiki warned. “She’s very stubborn. Shall we go?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very well.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  kept her walk composed while she left the canteen, eyes on the floor.  Plenty of curious gazes went her way but Kaname cut them dead with a  glare before anyone could bother her, following on behind her like a  bodyguard. Then they’d pushed through the door and Momomi walked  faster, without a word, fingers trailing the wall as if it was the only  thing that kept her from running. Her shoulders were set, her face  impossible to see, and it hurt Kaname to see her like that, but there  was little that could be done. “Hey,” she said softly.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Momomi demanded without looking round.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where are we going this time?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sarcastic bitch…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  sarcasm,” Kaname said innocently. “I just want to know that you’re not  going to drag me off some place completely at random, that would be  annoying.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one asked you to come.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as graceful  as ever… it’s my responsibility to be your friend, in the same way  Olesa has to act so disgustingly against the grain. I’m not going to  sabotage your plans even if you’re in a half a mood to drop them  yourself.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no one important watching us right now. Go if you want to go.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “You take me way too seriously.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me for that. I don’t take you seriously at all, so you must be really bad…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  better than having too dark a perspective on things. And I do know I’ve  had my moments like that, but it’s advice I know even if I can’t always  follow it. If I took things very seriously, Momomi, I’d have killed  myself long ago.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So first you try and kid around, and now you’re trying to out-angst me…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname caught up with her, looking sideways. “Would you rather I didn’t bother?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Well, tough. I’m going to bother you anyway.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Insensitive bastard.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dishonest fluffball.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fluffball? What the hell is that?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  knows.” Kaname shrugged. “Thanks to you, I’m running out of hostile  address, but hopefully that one isn’t running in your inner monologue.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed despite herself. “Only your stupid logic…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  your broody mind, too. If you ever have any mental volcab problems,  some straight to me. I have an insult for every occasion.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked around as they stepped outside, spotting a bench within the  convenient shade of a tree. It was a little out of the common way,  partially hidden and currently deserted. <em>Perfect for us, in other  words. We’ve made isolation a way of life, but the skills you develop  living like that sure come in handy at times like this. </em>She  grabbed Momomi by the forearm. “Come on, get over here. I’m not going  to let you sleepwalk me into the lake or somewhere weird, already…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!  Let go of me!” Momomi struggled a little, before giving up and hopping  after her overbearing friend. “That hurts, you know!”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sit down,” Kaname instructed. “At least you won’t get lost that way.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you ever hear of a suggestion?” Momomi pouted, sitting.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sat next to her, looking up at the sky. “Yes, but they’re less useful.  This way I know for sure that I’ll get things done.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi didn’t reply, looking at the floor absently. A few seconds pause, then she sighed.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  watched her out of the corner of her eye, trying to read her unreadable  friend’s face. The wind softly caressed Momomi’s brown hair, threads  flickering back and forth across her doll-like face. <em>But there’s an unusual warmth there, an emotion and, perhaps, a depth of pain, that isn’t usual. No,</em><em>her  face is always warm and lively… more recently, anyway, and with that  wry, glittering, sophisticated expression. I’ve always wondered whether  she only makes those faces for me, or whether they’re who she is. Did  Luigia see them when she was younger? Does she look like that in  lessons when I’m not around? With Shion and the Etoiles, too? I wish I  knew, and I wish I knew why I care to know. None of that’s important  right now, though, because she’s sad, and I don’t know what I can do. I  wish I was good at this thing, I wish I knew what to say. I’m sure  Momomi would say the right thing, she always has done so, but I’m not  like that, which leaves me impotent now. And I don’t like to see her  like this, even if it’s her sister that upset her. No, especially  because her sister upset her. But is that anger for her or for me?</em></span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s funny, isn’t it,” Momomi said suddenly, without looking up.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  you think you know someone so very well, until that moment when you  don’t know them at all… when you find something about them that doesn’t  sit well with your assumptions and your imaginings of that person… I  suppose it shows you how superficial our understandings are.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,”  Kaname said. Feeling that this was a little underwhelming as a  response, she groped for a follow-up. “Well, I suppose it’s a reason  for arguments. If you think someone’s perfect or exactly like you, you  probably don’t know them as well as you should.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We must know each other very well, then.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite. It’s not always fun, of course.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not quite sure what to do, though… do I remember this as part of who  she is? Or do I separate what I like about her in my mind from what I  hate?” She paused, but Kaname didn’t reply. She wasn’t looking for an  answer. “But it’s a little shocking, I guess. I don’t know what to  think… have you ever gone through the same thing?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Kaname  said casually. “Several times. When I realised who my father was… when  I met my mother for the first time, and realised just how far she was  from my dream of her… and a few friends after that. They felt like  betrayals. Some of them were literal betrayals. And this isn’t that.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, I’ve been thinking. I just thought sister would be different.  Why?” Momomi touched her forehead, brushing a lock of her out of her  eyes. “Because she’s someone I like? Because she seems fairly rational?  Because she’s young, and so she can’t believe the stupid anachronism  that her parents do… those are the things I thought. They felt rational  at the time.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“These things tend to,” Kaname said softly.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  when I look back it, I never had any real reasons, I just thought she  must think that way. Because I do. It’s kinda stupid, really.” Momomi’s  shoulders slumped slightly. “And then I wonder, what if I hadn’t come  to this school? Would I think just like her? Would I just dismiss the  Etoiles as immature children playing adult games? If I was raised  without this place’s influence, I probably would have been the same as  her.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t make her right,” Kaname pointed out. “Quite the reverse, because you have a wider life experience.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know, but still… and even more than that, if I hadn’t gone this school,  would I really still-” Momomi bit her lip, stopping in mid-sentence.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was that?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  frowned, looking sidelong at her dispirited friend again, and  hesitating for a moment. “Momomi.” She blurted it out, then cut herself  off.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehh… how do I put this one…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just get on with it,” Momomi said, sounding irritated.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright… well, don’t get offended, but… damn… that’s to say…” Kaname shut her eyes. “Are you gay, Momomi?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  that I think you are… not that there’s anything wrong with that, even  if you are,” Kaname said, waving her hands hurriedly. “And you don’t  have to reply if you don’t want to.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you ask now?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s just… you seemed a little defensive, back there, and before-”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So anyone who is passionate about gay rights is gay, now,” Momomi said sarcastically. “Thanks for that, Kaname.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, that’s not what I meant… whatever… forget I raised it, okay.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  give you a straight answer. But only because that’s the best way to  stop it from being a question that makes even you react like that when  you pose it.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s because…” Kaname decided to drop the smart caveats. “Okay, point established.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well…  yes, I’m gay. Probably... if not that, so confused as to make no  difference at this point in time.” Momomi was silent for a few moments.  “You know, that was easier to say than I thought it would be…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname felt a little shocked and a little… relieved? <em>No, glad. </em>“I’m glad for that.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not like I have anything to be ashamed of.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Kaname replied, annoyed. “I know that. Don’t expect any special treatment, either.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Suits me just fine.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname remembered the people who <em>would</em> treat her differently. “All the same…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All the same?” Momomi asked suspiciously.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It must be hard.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  considered how to reply to that, folding her hands in her lap. “From  time to time… I guess. But that’s what I get for being abnormal.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gave her a troubled look, but made no reply, looking away.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My sister… what would she say if she knew… and is it wrong that I don’t want her to know?” Momomi sighed.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  do what you think is right,” Kaname instructed, turning to face her  again. “You’re you, so don’t take crap. I’ll always have your back,  because we’re friends.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s just the  way it is,” Kaname said, facing down again. “Your sister’s the wrong  one, if you’ll let me go so far and take her phrase. That kind of  attitude annoys me.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish life was simpler,” Momomi said, simply and wistfully.</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t we all…” Kaname frowned as a thought occurred. “So, if you like girls, are there any you find cute?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked shocked for a moment, then looked down, breaking eye contact. “Well, there is one, when I think about it…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t sound very happy, you know.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I was thinking… if you got a girlfriend, that would definitely leave  less time for me. I’d hate it if you just abandoned all your friends  for some cute girl.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All my friends?” Momomi laughed bitterly. “There’s only you, you know.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it sounds less selfish if I say all your friends, even if I just mean me. So…”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  let her nagging curiosity get the better of her. “Well, who is this  person? Anyone I know? It has to be, surely… unless it’s someone in  your class. Or, god forbid, an upperclassman… or an underclassman…  nothing’s too weird for this school.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get ahead of yourself.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, who?”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked sidelong at her, smiling weakly. “I can’t tell you yet. It’s a secret.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so.” Kaname frowned, conflicting instincts warring in her head. <em>I guess I’ll be kind, and damn my selfishness and discomfort. </em>“Well, if you ever want any help with that, just ask.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced at her for a moment, then turned her gaze on the distant trees.  “I don’t think you could help me even if I asked.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname considered this, and laughed. “That’s true… I’m just being polite, you know.”</span></p>
  <p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She fell silent when her friend didn’t reply.</span></p>
