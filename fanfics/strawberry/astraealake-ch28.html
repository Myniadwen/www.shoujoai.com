<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Apologies if  the protagonists appear a little sidelined this chapter. I think it's  necessary to give the Etoiles their moments as well, and this is an arc  I want to explore. KanaMomo would probably have to deal with it in  their turn as well, though they might be a bit more direct...</span></p>

“Good  morning to you all,” Serané said pleasantly, bowing. “Sorry I’m late  again… we got a little caught up and lost track of time…” She brushed  her ruffled hair with her free hand in embarrassment.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah,” Rodrigo grunted, giving her a strange look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any  case, this is a week-end day, after all,” Kariya said, sitting down.  “The morning lessons are less important, so we obtained permission to  miss them. There’s no lack of time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s good.” Yukaho smiled. “Then in the afternoon it’s club activities, right? What do you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  lead the kendo club,” Kariya said briefly. “Something I’ve done ever  since I was a child. I’m sixth-Dan, but my training’s currently less  intense than it was before because I’m busy with Shiz- Serané. Being an  Etoile is sometimes an arduous duty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So I’ve heard.” Rodrigo leaned back in his chair. “And you, Diralna?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  nowhere near as talented as Kari-chan,” Serané said, cocking her head  and gazing ardently at her partner. “You should see her when she’s  doing her kendo, she’s amazing. She’s so strong…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s enough, Serané,” Kariya replied. “It’s embarrassing. I’m afraid I’m not that good, not even as good as I’d like to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I see.” Yukaho smiled politely. “That does sound very interesting. Perhaps you could show us at some point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  would be fine by me, at any point during our club. I don’t intend to  show off, though. That would be irresponsible, when my duty is to lead  the other students.” Kariya folded her arms, adopting her typical rigid  posture. “Really, my success should be measured by that of my pupils.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But they do very well, too, Kari-chan. You’re too modest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not perfect, Serané, far from it. At tournaments as well-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  always do very well at tournaments, so don’t say that either… it annoys  me when my really talented Kari-chan pretends she’s not amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya flushed red. “Serané… you’re embarrassing me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Blushing Kariya and fangirl Serané…I feel sick. These two are far scarier than Momomi and Olesa. </em>Kaname  glanced at Araldo and forgave them slightly; his current face,  approximately as if someone was driving rusty nails into his chest, was  priceless. <em>For once I bemoan my lack of Shion’s stalker talents,  notably the ability to whip out my phone and take a picture in two  seconds. This should be recorded so I can show it my grandchildren.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yukaho coughed, interrupting the festival of ardent love. “And you, Serané? What do you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  I’m not as good,” Serané replied seriously. “I just write poems for the  literature club, paint for the art club and help Kari-chan tend to the  Etoile greenhouse. That’s always enjoyable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Those are nice hobbies.” Yukaho smiled encouragingly. “You paint too, don’t you, Araldo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A  little, yeah,” the boy said, sounding embarrassed. “I’m not very good,  but it’s a diverting pastime. Perhaps you can show me your pictures at  some point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They’re not very good. I’d hate to show them to a stranger…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I can make it up to you, by showing you mine some time,” Araldo managed, looking crestfallen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm… I guess so. But you must promise not to laugh, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sure. It’s a promise.” He smiled encouragingly at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What  else do I like…” Serané mused, looking at her hands. “Well, I like  going shopping with Kari-chan, especially for lingerie-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya kicked her under the table, giving her a reproachful glare.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  tend to get carried away when shopping, though,” Serané continued. “I  end up spending far too much money… I’m lucky Kari-chan’s here to talk  some sense into me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re good friends, aren’t you?” Yukaho said politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, of course,” Serané said, linking arms with her “friend”. “I’m very fond of Kari-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, someone has to look after her,” Kariya added evasively, looking down at the table.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Tell me, Nakano-san,” Luigia said. “You live in Kariya, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  right. It would be a little embarrassing, being named after my home  city… but my father said it was because he owned that city, so I’d  inherit it. That’s a gross exaggeration, but I appreciate the  sentiment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you have a mansion there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  truthfully it’s more of an office block,” Kariya said. “One of the  taller buildings in the inner city. It acts as my father’s business  headquarters, but also has substantial residential features on the  upper floors. We’re a very modern family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kari-chan’s home is  amazing,” Serané said. “I’ve been there. It’s all posh and western and  high-tech on the lower floors, but the upper area is traditional  Japanese, with impressive bedrooms. Kari-chan looks amazing when she’s  sitting there by her father in a kimono…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s interesting,”  Yukaho said. “The mix of old and new, yes? When I was young, I always  felt that was my country through. It doesn’t sound like that’s changed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  right,” Kariya said. “Moving into a modern world while trying to keep  hold of our past traditions, that’s the difficult thing. It’s something  my family engages in freely. We have our own important traditions, but  we also have to be practical in a changing world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s a  problem affecting people everywhere,” Yukaho said. “Old families are  dying everywhere. I suppose that’s why you’re here, the ones who have  done well with the times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You flatter us,” Kariya said. “But we  have over two-hundred years of tradition in our field, which in itself  is four hundred years old. Our origins are as deep and noble as anyone  else’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Your family sounds quite impressive,” Luigia said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thank  you. I’ve always been interested by the European families, though…”  Kariya smiled. “Serané’s family in particular. Their mansion is  beautiful and their traditions fine, it’s been a pleasure to stay there  the few times that I’ve gone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you’ve visited the Diralna family, then?” Luigia asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They’re pleasant people,” Kariya said. “My stays with them were regretfully short, but I enjoyed the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  I’ve visited Kariya’s family, too,” Serané added. “They can be a little  scary, but I have a lot of respect for them. We’ve made it a little  tradition of ours, to alternate visiting families in summer. I’ll be  going to her family this year.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You should come visit our home at some point,” Yukaho suggested. “It’s only fair, since you’re being a gracious host here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s a wonderful idea!” Serané said enthusiastically. “Isn’t it, Kari-chan? You could see another European family’s mansion!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I would enjoy that,” Kariya said, smiling. “I’ve heard some wonderful things about the Phareli estate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  it’s quite attractive,” Yukaho managed, looking a little bemused. “It  took a while for me to get used to it, from Japan but living in such a  totally western house…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“My wife wasn’t asking whether the  Etoiles of Astraea would like to come and stay at our house,” Rodrigo  said bluntly. “She was asking whether Araldo’s fiancée would like to  stay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Dear!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Araldo-kun’s fiancée?” Serané asked, wrinkling her perfect brow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That would be you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  so that’s your mistake,” she said sweetly. “You’d confused me, you see,  because you said fiancée… but I’m not engaged to him. Certainly, I  don’t recall giving my consent to such a thing.” Her words were melodic  and calm, but there was a steel in them that had been entirely absent  throughout her cute-girl act.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s a semantic point,” Rodrigo said. “It was an invitation to you, in deference to an arrangement made.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  arrangement is provision at best,” Serané pointed out. “But I’ve never  really followed such boring things… all the same, though, I’d be a  little worried to go to your home without Kari-chan. To be in the same  house as Araldo-kun, with such an arrangement in mind, it’s  embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s rude, Serané,” Kariya chided.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing inappropriate would happen between us,” Araldo said, sounding slightly offended. “You have my word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“All the same…” Serané whispered, fluttering her eyelashes. “It worries me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’s traditionally minded,” Kariya said by way of explanation. “Forgive her-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo snorted. “Is it traditionally minded to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  it’s not really that, exactly,” Serané said, blushing and looking at  the table. “I’ve just got used to having Kari-chan around, and I’m not  strong or brave like her myself… so it would be a little scary to have  to go to a whole new house without her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You can’t stay with her for all your life,” Luigia pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Friends,  family and lovers all manage something that’s, if not that, close  enough.” Momomi glared at her sister and spoke up for the first time.  “I’m sure they’ll manage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It might not be easy, but I will  definitely try my best to be with Serané, whenever she needs me,”  Kariya said. “That’s my responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“All the same, is it sensible to grow up holding on to such a friendship?” Rodrigo asked. “That could be dangerously childish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just  because something began in childhood, there’s no need to leave it  behind,” Serané said. “Family, for example. You can part company with  your family in adulthood, but it’s not a good idea. Even if you start  your own family.” She closed her eyes. “In the same way, Kari-chan is  important family to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How about you, Kariya-chan?” Yukaho  inquired. “Does your family have any plans for you? A handsome girl  like you must surely have many suitors…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, my father hasn’t  raised anything like that with me,” Kariya said. “He respects me too  much as his daughter to use me as a common bargaining chip.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s wonderful. What are his future plans for you, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“He  wants me to take over his business, if that’s possible,” Kariya said.  “I’m not sure I’m equal to the burden of his office, though, and it  would be very unorthodox in itself. It’s not a traditionally hereditary  position, and the company has an entrenched patriarchal heritage. It  could be difficult for me to realise his expectations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That must be hard for you,” Luigia said sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  is, but also encouraging,” Kariya said. “His faith is flattering…  likewise, I’m aware that in fullness of time he may expect me to make a  convenient marriage, if I agree to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I intend  to oppose him on that, of course,” Kariya said boldly. “He may speak of  family duty, but before that he’s imbued me with his own values, to be  strong, independent and reliant on my own authority. A marriage against  my will would jeopardise that, and they are important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  understand the importance of independence,” Yukaho said politely. “But  there’s a lot to be said for arranged marriage as well… not one where  you are compelled, of course, that would be meaningless, but one with  the advice of your mature family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Before we carry on with that line of thought, refresh my memory,” Momomi said. “Was your marriage arranged, mother?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s not the point,” Rodrigo grunted. “It’s still a good point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, are you admitting that you made a mistake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  as impudent as ever. Stay out of this. Perhaps you’ll have something to  bring to this kind of conversation in three years time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Dear!” Yukaho said, sounding shocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s a fact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re being a little unfair, father,” Luigia said. “She was asking a question, not arguing with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yukaho raised a hand before her husband could reply. “Shall we leave things here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah,”  Rodrigo said, glaring at his daughters. “But all the same, children can  easily make stupid mistakes in the heat of the moment. It would be  foolish to dismiss their advice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya narrowed her eyes. “I’m sorry. But it would be impossible for me to accept any partner my parents are likely to suggest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do  you have to be so sweeping with that?” Yukaho asked, smiling weakly.  “I’m sure your parents would be said to hear that their opinions are  worse than none.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not a matter that can be changed,” Kariya said simply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ve  always had reservations about arranged marriage myself,” Serané said.  “I don’t know Araldo-kun very well at all, and he doesn’t know me… are  you sure that you want me to be your new daughter, knowing so little  about me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’d always be welcome to join our family. Isn’t  that right?” Yukaho coughed when her husband just grunted. “But we have  plenty of time to get to know you better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I understand that. But I still do not think I am someone able to make Araldo-kun happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t say that yet,” Araldo said. “We’ve barely met, and I do enjoy your company.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of  course. Araldo-kun is a good friend.” Serané cocked her head, abashed.  “But I’m not convinced we would be suitable for each other. Under the  circumstances, it’s impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t say that so soon,” Yukaho said encouragingly. “There’s no need to come to any decision in a short space of time…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s not it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, we’ve lingered for rather too long over this breakfast,”  Yukaho said. “Why don’t you show Araldo-kun your pictures, Serané-chan?  There’s no need to be shy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané nodded, standing. “That’s a good idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And perhaps you could show us the greenhouse, Kariya-san,” Luigia said. “I was very impressed by that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya nodded. “If that’s what you want, then fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, shall we go?” Serané said. “Araldo-kun? Momomi-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Me?” Momomi asked stupidly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  interested in art as well, aren’t you?” Serané beamed down at her with  a wonderful false sincerity. “Won’t our conversation be more  interesting if there’s two of you to laugh at my terrible work?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah… you’re right,” Momomi said. “I’d love to hear some of your advice, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  so bad, I’m sure I’ll be the one asking you for advice.” Serané was  already walking away, Momomi close on her heels. Araldo trailed after  them both, looking crestfallen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya gave them all a triumphant  look. “That’s just so much false modesty, she’s very good, actually,”  she said conversationally. “So it’s a bit hypocritical of her to accuse  me of over-humbleness about my kendo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Is that so?” Luigia said. “I suppose it’s just common courtesy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps,  but it can be a little annoying.” Kariya shrugged the subject away. “In  any case, I’m showing you all the greenhouse, yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course,” Yukaho said, while Rodrigo made a doubtful noise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  a very wonderful building, actually,” Kariya said. “Pretty, peaceful,  warm, and ideal for private conversation. I like going there with  Serané, but I’ll also enjoy showing you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smirked as they left the room, heading for the greenhouse. <em>This  is way too much fun. I’d try and help out, but I’d be wasting my  breath. Between their movement left, right and centre in conversation  and the family’s constitutional inability to confront them over a  certain word beginning with g, the Etoiles have them completely screwed  over. I almost feel sorry for that idiot Araldo, but not quite. This is  the way the world is; it’s impossible to make everyone you like, like  you. It’s a hard, cold truth. Perhaps some people need it hammered home  to them, but I know that already. It’s just logical. </em>She remembered Momomi and her “cute girl”. <em>I  wonder whether it will be like that for her…that’s definitely something  to remember. For the one time in thirty that bastard suffers like this,  she’ll suffer twenty-nine times. Well, perhaps not in this school, but  generally. Now that is a genuinely harsh truth. But I do want Momomi to  be happy…at the same time, it would be annoying if she started spending  time with a girlfriend instead of me. Shion, Olesa and Amiki are bad  enough, I’m not sure I could stand it if Momomi actually was with  someone else more than me. She’s my only friend, after all. But that is  a pretty selfish attitude. Isn’t supporting her the proper thing to do?  That sounds cooler out loud, though, and I’m sure it would annoy me  really. Somehow the whole idea frustrates me…I guess I still find it  weird. But I don’t tell her that. She doesn’t need to be hurt any more  than she already has.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She’d dropped behind, having little  interest in the trite conversation that was being bandied about, her  hands in her pockets as she looked thoughtfully at the floor. So she  was surprised when Luigia slipped back and fell into step with her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hi.” Kaname gave her a cursory glance then turned away again, her face hostile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Luigia smiled. “I wanted to thank you for yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I didn’t do anything yesterday. That was a matter between the two of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly.  That’s something I’m grateful for. You were very tactful, and I  appreciate it. I’m also glad that you’re protecting and supporting my  sister.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d do that with or without your approval,” Kaname said. “It’s something I do for myself, more than for you, or even for her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know. That’s why I’m so glad for her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ha.  Philosophical, aren’t you?” Kaname glared at her. “Just because Momomi  has forgiven you, that doesn’t mean I have, though. Personally, I find  your opinions obnoxious and self-evidently ridiculous. I’ll tolerate it  for her sake, not yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. I wouldn’t expect anything  else. But her opinions might not necessarily be yours. You let her do  most of the talking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t expect the support of the silent majority. My opinions are far closer to hers than they are for yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know. I’m just making an observation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case,” Kaname said. “I don’t feel that I owe you anything, so I’m  free to warn you. If you make Momomi unhappy, I’ll make you pay for  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And vice versa.” Luigia smiled. “I think we both want to  be her protector… but it’s probably impossible for me to do that now,  so I’m counting on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know. But even if you say that, it’s  probably to make yourself feel better. And it’s the same for me.”  Kaname glanced at her with crimson eyes. “Momomi can look after  herself, and she even takes it on herself to look after me. If  anything, I wish she made me worry a little more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’d like to feel needed by her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing so Freudian,” Kaname snapped. “I just want to repay the debts I owe her. No more, no less.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah…” Luigia looked at the floor for the moment. “Can ask you a personal question, Kenjou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yesterday,  my sister made a confession about herself that you’ll remember,” Luigia  whispered, glancing briefly at her father. “How does that relate to  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Do we have to talk about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you’re uncomfortable in doing so, then I won’t force you to reply.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname look around, trying not to show her discomfort with that topic. “I’m… normal. Not like her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So don’t worry. I’m not the dirty dyke stealing your sister, or anything weird like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Luigia  smiled. “Very well. Though if that was to happen, I think there could  be worse people than you. I don’t know you very well, but I feel I can  trust you with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname blushed furiously at the thought. “Where’s all this come from? I thought you were against- all that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  am, and I continue to be. But I must be realistic.” Luigia sighed. “My  sister will do what she considers natural… I hope it will not hurt her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There’s as much chance of that as there is if she was any teenager starting a relationship,” Kaname pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You mean the odds are close to one?” Luigia teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname considered this. “I suppose so. But I’ll be here. If she does anything stupid I’ll be the one to beat sense into her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m glad to hear of that. By the way… is there anyone who Momomi sees that way? Or am I getting ahead of myself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  closed her eyes, remembering their conversation the day before. “No  one,” she lied. She wasn’t sure why. Probably just to reassure Luigia,  but what did it matter. “So don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah. Touching on  another, slightly related, topic,” Luigia said, “I wouldn’t be mistaken  in saying that the Etoiles are being a little obstructionistic, would  I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course they are. They have nothing to lose, except  Serané’s family… but their love, their freedom and their pride, those  are all at stake.” Kaname shrugged. “Only an idiot wouldn’t fight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  the thing about emotions. It doesn’t matter if they’re real or not,  which is something very hard to define, they just have to be real  enough. In this case, that’s true for them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Momomi’s trying to help them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because they’re helping her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In part. But she also has an emotional stake in their outcome. Looking at them, she probably sees what might become of her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I hope that doesn’t come to pass,” Luigia said vaguely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, none of you are going to win against those two. I don’t like  them very much, but I do know that. They’re far too strong and smart  for it, and unlike you, they have an uninhibited resolve, which is  always an advantage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think this matter is concluded  yet.” Luigia sighed. “Actually, it almost works in my favour if Araldo  is dumped. But I don’t fancy facing the duty of the heir myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What would you do? If they suggested an arranged marriage for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t know,” Luigia said. “It’s never seemed close to happening, so I haven’t thought much about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In denial?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll think about it when I need to. Worrying about it before then is pointless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Worrying would provide you with a much-needed sense of perspective.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Luigia laughed. “Perhaps you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oi! Kenjou! You shouldn’t fall too far behind. I don’t trust you out of my sight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes, Etoile-sama,” Kaname replied sarcastically, refusing to alter her pace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And take your hands out of your pockets. We have standards, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname just rolled her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya  turned and opened the door to the greenhouse, holding it open while the  others stepped past her. “Kiyashiki-san probably showed you this place  before… I don’t like it that much, but Serané does, and we work  together to maintain it. That’s one of the duties of the Etoiles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a beautiful place,” Luigia said enthusiastically. “Do you take care of it all yourselves? That must be difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  technically there are some sixth year assistants who help us out and  cover us when we can’t make it. But we’re expected to lead and do most  of the work. It’s one of the better aspects of the duty, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What do you do exactly, though? Momomi gave you some incredible qualities in her letters, but I’ve never been clear on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re  the Etoiles, selected to provide an example for the schools, beyond  everything else,” Kariya explained. “We represent the school when  guests come here, and we provide a high standard for the other  students. We look after the students as best we can and arbitrate  between the three schools. We’re personally responsible for a lot of  what happens here. And we have to do dull paperwork, as well. That’s  about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“All that? For two ordinary students?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s the way it is. It’s not too hard, if you really put your mind to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For someone like you, perhaps,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  got nothing to do with me, except perhaps my determination. Even you  could do this job, Kenjou, though you’d set a terrible example for the  others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname laughed at the thought. “Me as Etoile… you don’t know me very well, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Say  what you like, but popularity is the simplest of the qualities  required.” Kariya shrugged. “It can be obtained fairly easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Again, that’s easy for you to say. But inclination is a more fundamental stumbling block for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked around as the group fell into silence. Aside from the warmth, she didn’t particularly like it. <em>I’ve  never been interested in flowers and things, so I certainly don’t see  the point of this place. It’s more like Momomi’s kind of thing, only  she doesn’t like it much either. She said it was far too artificial,  too forced and made and beside the point. Putting nature in the bars  isn’t going to relieve us from our culture. Something like that. I  can’t see it, myself, but she was firm when she said that. I wonder  what it feels like, when you can be moved to happiness or annoyance by  mere flowers. Is that charming or stupid?</em> The others had stopped  ahead, so she stopped by one of the flowerpots, staring down at what  was inside. “Roses? That’s a bit unusual, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Serané  likes roses,” Kariya said, her voice a little softer than normal. “So  she persuaded me to help her grow a lot of them. They’re in all  colours, but she likes the red ones most of all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They’re beautiful,” Luigia said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ve  always found roses a vaguely disturbing flower,” Kaname narrated.  “They’re beautiful, certainly, with the silky, coloured petals and the  striking green stem, but they’re still marked by razor thorns, just  hidden beneath the surface. If you’re too casual, you’ll cut yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“An impressive metaphor for the nature of love or the transience of life’s pleasures or somesuch, to be sure,” Kariya said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No need for sarcasm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Who said I was being sarcastic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s probable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Red roses.” Luigia smiled. “Do you let students use these?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya  nodded. “When they’re ready for cutting, anyway. That’s really Serané’s  business. She tries to arrange it so they’re finished growing on  certain days. I can’t see the point, myself. But it makes her happy, so  I help her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How beautiful,” Kaname muttered, still feeling irritable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It doesn’t matter what you think. You may well be coming to us for these flowers before we leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nakano-san, can we talk?” Rodrigo’s arms were folded, his attitude impatient.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In a serious manner?” Kariya asked, turning on him with cold eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In such a manner, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She nodded. “I think that is for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Dear, are you sure this is the best way?” Yukaho asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If it makes you feel better, I’ll go first.” Kariya glared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Yukaho sighed and nodded. “Very well. You two, can you give us a few minutes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname closed her eyes stubbornly. “I’m not going anywhere, and it would be hard to force me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Please,” Yukaho said. “It’s for your own good…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll be the judge of my own good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  as obstinate as ever, Kenjou.” Kariya snorted. “Do what you please, I  won’t stop you. But don’t interfere. This is between us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I won’t interfere until I have to. But I won’t commit myself to silence, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m the same,” Luigia said. “As a family member, this does concern me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Very well.” Rodrigo ignored the two younger girls, locking eyes with Kariya.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So,  what is it you want to say?” Kariya had one hand resting lightly on her  hip, while the other simply stayed by her side. Her head was slightly  cocked, eyes sharp and focused, ostensibly giving him her full  attention. But there was an edge, too, the tilt of her chin and the set  of her shoulders, that radiated a silent challenge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What is your relationship with Serané Diralna?” Rodrigo asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re pretty blunt,” Kariya noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t dodge a simple question.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya  closed her eyes for a moment. “So that’s how you do things… I approve,  because it’s my way too. I can speak freely, then.” She opened her  eyes, staring him down. “I’ve been a friend to her since our second  year, girlfriend in our third, lover by our fourth and Etoiles together  since the start of this year. I love her and she loves me. That’s my  relationship with Serané Diralna.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you really are deviants.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The  only deviant thing is your attitude, which should have died out a long  time ago. But traditions die hard. You’re living proof of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  snorted. “We’re people of Christian faith, unlike yourself. If too many  people have forgotten that your behaviour is against God’s will, that’s  no concern of mine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If we argue on those terms, there’ll be so  much empty rhetoric. It’s not important.” Kariya tilted her head  upwards slightly, gazing down from her slight height advantage. “But  don’t misunderstand. We’re not confused or stupid or anything like  that. Our emotions, our love, it’s as strong as yours, whether you can  accept that or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even if you continue to labour under that  delusion, it makes no difference. Your love doesn’t mean anything in  this world.” Rodrigo raised his voice slightly, talking in fast,  clipped sentences. This was the steel behind his boyish façade.  “Serané’s world is not one where you will be accepted. She must fulfil  her duty as the only child of the Diralna, and marry appropriately. If  you persist in clinging to her, you will only destroy her reputation  and her life. Selfish, unnatural feelings won’t help her at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  pretty bold, considering you don’t know her. But I speak to her every  day, and I know what she wants, and I know what she fears. I have made  it my business to know that.” Kariya snorted. “That’s why I’d never  accept this marriage. To hand my beloved to a bigoted, ignorant and  arrogant person such as yourself, who regards her as nothing but a  means to an end and doesn’t care about her own feelings… I’ve no  intention of doing that. I’ve met street trash who would make better  father-in-laws than you. They know what love is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Unfortunately,  your opinion’s irrelevant,” Rodrigo replied. “Completely so. No one of  importance will recognise your fiery rhetoric, because you mean nothing  at all. This is a matter to be settled between the Phareli and the  Diralna, mature adults who aren’t swayed by your diseased mindsets. We  are the mature adults, and we’re the ones who know what is best for  Serané.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t you dare call her by her first time,” Kariya spat. “You don’t have any right to do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you have the right to tell me that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  can only address her like that if she gives you permission,” Kariya  said, slightly more calmly. “She has not, and she would not, and you  haven’t asked. And there’s one person who my opinion matters to: that’s  her. You don’t count her, because she’s not important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’s already proved herself unable to make rational judgements.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  just a convenient lie for you. I admire it.” Kariya took a step  forwards, her eyes steady. “If something doesn’t suit you, you’ll stick  your head in the ground and ignore it. But to be able to instantly  dismiss the opinions of ten percent of the world’s population, that’s  truly impressive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s the arrogance of youth to presume to  know everything in this world. One day, if you’re lucky, you’ll look at  yourself at this point in time and shudder. But that’s not important. I  told you before, your opinion means nothing. You’re the one in denial  about that.” Rodrigo scowled at her, brown eyes intense. “This is the  will of the Phareli and the Diralna. You have no place here. You are  deliberately obstructing our actions and I will not accept it. I will  make that, and many other things, clear to the faculty of this school  and your parents alike.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Feel free, they’ll both ignore you. But  don’t go see my father in person. For your own good. And I could care  less if you think I’m an irrelevance, I’ll oppose you all the same. You  said yourself, I’m in your way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There should be a limit to the impetuosity of youth. I will have to show you that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Let’s  not let this degenerate into a matter of threats. That’s something I’m  too used to and I find it deadly dull. Excuse the pun. So let’s get  this over with.” Kariya flicked a strand of long red hair over her  shoulder. “I’m in love with her and I don’t intend to give her up. She  doesn’t want anything to do with you and I’ll support her in that.  Nothing you can say or do will change those inconvenient facts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  hate you and everything you stand for, but at least you talk straight.”  Rodrigo gave her a contemptuous glare. “If you persist in clinging to  your childish dreams beyond their time, I’ll be forced to take them  from you. I’m from a real world far crueller than the comfortable  delusions of this school and your so-called love alike.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  definitely don’t live in the real world, if you don’t realise that not  everyone is a convenient part of your narrow-minded vision. But that’s  irrelevant. I think we understand each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kariya nodded as if this was a routine matter. “Was there anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It looks like there’s nothing more to be said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then let’s continue the tour. I still need to show you the geraniums.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Very well.”</span></p>
