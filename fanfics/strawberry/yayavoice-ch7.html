<p>----------</p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Hikari: Was that a dream?</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  sat down for lunch with Yaya-chan, who was still in line after failing  to choose what she wanted to eat for the past twenty minutes. I was  taking a bite out of my sandwich when I realized that it was Thursday  once again… it had been a week since I’ve learned that Yaya-chan had  lost her voice. I almost can’t believe it. But waking up and seeing her  greet me with a written note each morning… makes me slowly realize that  this is not a dream.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Speaking of dreams…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’ve been having a  recurring dream… one with Yaya-chan with me… in her bed… and almost  naked… ever since that night where I had spent the night beside her in  her bed, all because of a nightmare that I could not remember.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  the dream… I awaken in the middle of the night… or maybe it was morning  already. Yaya-chan was facing me, ‘her face looked sad.’ I thought. <em>‘…but beautiful.’</em> That was the first time I thought that about Yaya-chan. Well honestly I  know she’s beautiful… it’s just that, at that time… it felt different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  sleeping face in the darkness was a wondrous template, the way her eyes  were closed was beautiful beyond words… the way her lips was pursed was  seductively entrancing… the way her dark hair fell on her face and skin  was like a shining silk curtains... I stared at her for what seemed  like an eternity. But even an eternity can be just a second when it  ends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I don’t know why, but I found myself coming closer to her.  Slowly leveling my face with hers… and kissing her lips. It felt so  real that I could feel her, smell her and taste her. I found myself  withdrawing… thinking, wishing, and believing… that this truly was a  dream. I kissed her again and again, but she stayed asleep… just as I  wanted. I took my time to enjoy her, I caressed her skin anywhere that  wasn’t covered and too hard to reach. She responded in small gasps that  sounded in approval of my ministrations.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pausing or stopping  didn’t occur to me. It was a dream, a dream with Yaya-chan. I didn’t  know why I was doing what I was doing. Other than… <em>‘She is beautiful…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself growing bolder, realizing that I had just slipped my hands  under her top and was touching her soft breasts. I even thought; <em>‘Even in my dreams… Yaya-chan doesn’t wear a bra.’</em> I dared do something that she seemed to like doing to me whenever we’re taking a shower together...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I touched...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">...caressed...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">...fondled her breasts... <em>‘she is so soft…’</em> and her sleeping breath sounded like music to me. It was enchanting.  She was enchanting… so much that I had considered doing this to  Yaya-chan… for real.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The dream ended there and I found myself  waking in Yaya-chan’s bed the morning I first dreamt it, a fact that I  didn’t immediately remember. The sun was shining brightly through our  bedroom window. It took me a while to fully wake up. And the first  thing I realized was… I was in the wrong bed. The second was Yaya-chan  was not on her bed… or mine. Which wasn’t the least bit unusual to me,  she has always been a morning person even though people would guess  other wise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It took a while to register to me that I had two  pillows. One on my head, and the other was in my arms. It gave off the  scent of Yaya-chan’s shampoo and a hint of her own. It was enough to  make me recall my dream. I blushed and wondered why I had such a dream,  and with Yaya-chan of all people.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Deciding to push the thoughts  away from my mind for a while, I sat up and found a note on Yaya-chan’s  desk. It folded so that it could stand; a part of it was facing me. It  took me a moment before I realized that it was addressed to me. I  reached for it and opened it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><u>Hikari, </u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><u>I felt like going out and watching the sunrise. In case I’m not back, eat breakfast without me. </u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><u>-Yaya</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><u>P.S.:Good Morning!</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Is  what it said. I placed the note somewhere and got a look of the clock.  I was glad it was Sunday; had it been a week day… waking up this late  would be embarrassing. Although I usually don’t worry about that, since  Yaya-chan always wakes me up if I take too long… except that week, when  she was avoiding me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was shaken off from my thoughts when I heard… “Did you remember the hickey on Yaya-san’s neck last Sunday?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>HICKEY!?!’</em> my mind screamed. I recalled fragments of the dream and found myself  listening in to the conversation the girls at the table behind me was  having.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was pretty small that you could barely see it.” said a girl who sounded familiar.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  been talking about Yaya-sempai a lot lately Rin.” said another who  sounded younger. I realized that the one called Rin was probably one of  our classmates, Tousaka-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s Sakura who brings her up so much.” retorted Tousaka-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I heared another girl gasp and drop her fork. “… I… didn’t mean… too…” she said meekly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then heard someone patted someone’s shoulder lightly. “It’s okay,  Sakura. I’m quite sure you’re not the only girl who crushing on  Nanto-san…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Eh?!’</em> I felt a little panicked for some reason. <em>‘why am I panicking?’</em> I asked myself… probably because I’m overhearing rumors about my own best friend. Yeah, that’s got to be it…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…But  if you want to get her you better get more aggressive. Before the one  that gets to lightly land a hickey on her gets her.” continued Rin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wondered who could have… It took a moment, but I realized. It could  have been me. No there’s no doubt… It could only have been me. It’s so  clear now I had that dream because I was sleeping beside Yaya-chan. And  it happened on Sunday… the same day that these girls said that she had  a hickey.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you know. I saw Yaya-sempai this morning. She had a new one under her chin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>EEK!!!’</em> I had slept beside Yaya-chan again last night and had that dream again. I wonder if she had noticed…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself listening to the girl’s conversation more. The little  girl, called Ilya mentions that the only reason that Sakura was with  them watching Amane-sempai’s riding lately was because Yaya-chan was  not present in the saintly chorus. Rin claims that she loves horses…  while ‘subtly’ revealing that Ilya has a crush on almost every rider in  the horse riding club.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girls continue talking; but little by  little anything they say no longer register in my head. I find myself  contemplating on their words, mostly those that had anything to do with  Yaya-chan. I found myself thinking about her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’s changed… I  know that loosing her voice poses a great hindrance to her lifestyle,  but she doesn’t seem that much concerned or at least she’s not showing  it. She makes it look like that she’s been conversing with a pen and  paper since we’ve known her and not many seem to complain about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’s  also been acting differently… I know that she can’t tease us as much as  she has before, but she hasn’t teased me since… since I found out she  had lost her voice. She’s been quiet, doing things that don’t require  her voice. Like drawing or reading. Another thing is that she has been  returning from school just near curfew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m getting concerned but  I haven’t asked her about any of it. I’m not sure if I have to or  should ask her about it. I mean it’s not like last time… when she’s  been avoiding me. But this feels like she’s also avoiding me… or should  I say… … I don’t know what to think anymore. It’s all too confusing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  then I felt a hand touch my shoulder. I was so absorbed in my thinking  that the simple touched surprised me… causing me to jump away a bit and <strong>“YAAAA.”</strong> scream…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was surprised to see Yaya-chan looking  at me with one of her eyebrow raised in a curious fashion. She stood  nearly beside me, her arm was still raised and near my shoulder but was  soon lowered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry Yaya-chan. I was a little out of it.” I excused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She held a laugh and forced herself to smile nicely and nodded twice or thrice. <em>‘there it is!!!’</em> I could feel my face heating up when I noticed the said hickey under  her chin. It wasn’t such a big or obvious thing, but small and blended  with her skin color enough for anyone not looking for it not to notice,  which made me wonder how those girls noticed it. I watched her sit down  and begin eating her soup… I then noticed… that ever since she lost her  voice, I haven’t seen her eat as much as she usually does. She looks  thinner lately. I wonder why she’s not eating much?...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It didn’t  take long for the girls from the other table to notice Yaya-chan was  now present at the seat in front of me. They whispered amongst  themselves for a moment, try as I might to hear what they were saying…  but all I could hear was ‘go!’ ‘ask her’ ‘can’t’ ‘come on!’ but after a  few moments, I could hear the girl behind my stand and walk over near  Yaya-chan side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good Afternoon! Nanto-san. Konohana-san.” A girl  with dark long dark hair tied into twin tails greeted us both in a  polite and well raise manner.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good Afternoon! Tousaka-san.” I  greeted back with a smile, trying not to be rude. I have to admit I was  curious of what she wanted to talk to Yaya-san about. But at the same  time very nervous… and hoping she would not mention the hickeys that I  might have gave her in my sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan looked up from her meal, smiled and waved a hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tousaka-san  blushed slightly and began to look a bit nervous that she usually does.  “Pardon me asking Nanto-san, a lot of girls have been wondering about  this lately…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>OH! NO!... she’s going to talk about the hickey!’</em> I nervously and nearly in panicked thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  wanted me to ask you too… Um… too…” she cleared her throat, for a  moment to ease her nervousness… which unfortunately increased mine.  “Would it be alright… if some girls form a Fan Club for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>EH?... Fan Club?’</em> I echoed in my mind. I never thought Yaya-chan was so popular. I turned  to face Yaya-chan, who was looking at Tousaka-san in disbelief. I could  feel an odd sense of foreboding around us. Taking the time and care to  look around our table, I noticed that a lot of girls were looking at  Yaya-chan’s and Tousaka-san’s direction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan then flipped open her notebook and wrote: <em><u>“Do I have to do anything?”</u></em> and showed it to Tousaka-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She read it, smiled and shook her head. “The only thing we need you to do is recognize it as your Fan Club.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I turned to Yaya-chan who looked like she was thinking about it. But she then smiled and wrote: <em><u>“If that’s all I guess It won’t really hurt would it...”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tousaka-san nodded. “Well girls you can worship her all you want now!” She said aloud.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Little  did we realize we were in the center of all Yaya-chan fans… A lot of  girls stood up around us and screamed for joy. Then converged around  our table and began throwing out comments that I’ve only ever heard  being told to Amane-sempai. They began asking all sorts of questions,  too fast for Yaya-chan to answer without her voice. <em>‘Like thoughtless over exited girls.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan  looked like she was in a pinch and we had yet to finish our lunch.  “Umm… everyone! I think you’re bothering Yaya-chan.” I said without  thinking how the girls will react to my comment of their actions. I  found myself in the receiving end of the fan-girls angry glares. They  also began saying mean things like.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who are you to tell us that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you the one who’s always bothering Yaya-sama!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know?!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And… “You don’t deserve Yaya-onee-sama’s attention!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  felt like crying… I didn’t mean what I said, at least not the way they  took it. Tears slowly escaped from my eyes when we were all surprised  and silenced by a loud banging on the table. All the other girls backed  away slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan had slammed both of her hands down on  our table. She looked… angry… very angry. Her eyes were closed… like  she was thinking or waiting for the girls’ reactions. Her lips slightly  open, and I could see that she was gritting her teeth, holding back the  harsh words and the desire to shout. I remember when I asked Yaya-chan  when was the last time she got angry. She told me she could not  remember, she didn’t tell me what it was like but she did tell me she  hated getting angry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And I think I can feel why… Yaya-chan gives  of a very scary feeling. Even I feel scared and I believe that her  anger isn’t directed at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After a minute or two of silence,  Yaya-chan lets out a sigh. Her face softens from angry to  disappointment. She picks up her notebook and steps away from her seat.  All eyes including mine were watching her as she walked to my side and  took my hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I questioningly looked at her she did a small  head gesture pointing towards the exit. I understood that she wanted us  to leave the cafeteria immediately. Even though she had not eaten much  yet…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you going too…” before I could even finish my  sentence, she shakes her head and lightly tugs on my hand. I could only  nod and follow my best friend. The girls were quiet as we left, I guess  they were stunned at Yaya-chan’s reaction. I thought that Yaya-chan  would be happy having a fan club, but I’m happy to know I as her best  friend came first.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We returned to our classroom earlier than  most. Yaya-chan slumped on her desk weakly, not the least bit  embarrassed of her growling stomach. I felt sorry for her, so I told  her that she could go back to the cafeteria and get something. She then  wrote a note that told me that even though her stomach was growling she  didn’t feel like eating anymore. I doubted if that was possible but  Yaya-chan is not someone to do something when she doesn’t want to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Our  first teacher made a comment about Yaya-chan’s loud and complaining  stomach. Yaya-chan just said she didn’t feel like eating and the  teacher made some comment about Yaya-chan being lazy… but that’s the  farthest from the truth. The truth is that she didn’t want to make a  big story of what happened to us in the cafeteria. Or at least that’s  what I’d like to think she’s thinking. I’m not saying that I know how  Yaya-chan thinks. I find myself checking on Yaya-chan every now and  then, for the rest of our afternoon classes. She tiredly took notes and  tried to pay attention. It made me feel bad knowing that I’m the cause  of her hunger now. <em>‘I shouldn’t have said anything back then...’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Classes  ended hours later and the first thing I told her was to get someone  thing to eat. She laughed and smiled before nodding and packing up her  things. Unlike before, we’d go almost anywhere together after class. A  Thursday was supposed to be a free-day, but last Friday’s skipping  meant that we had choir practice today and tomorrow, and I’m the only  one going. I have asked Yaya-chan where she went when I’m at the  saintly chorus. She had told me that she was just drawing, here and  there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She wrote something about finally having the will to eat, which we found funny and laughed at for a bit before separating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Midway  from the church I saw some girls standing there in a line. When I got  closer I realized that they were the same girls that got angry and  yelled at me for telling them they were bothering Yaya-chan. I stopped  a few meters away, while they too it as a sign to come closer. I was  nervous… I wasn’t the least bit ready to be yelled at again. And this  time Yaya-chan was no where to protect me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari-sempai…” said one girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I swallowed… hard. Anxiety was getting to me, but before my fear got any worse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>We are very sorry!”</strong> the group said in unison.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I was surprised to find them all bowing their heads. “huh?” was all I could say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One  girl stepped forward. She had long purple hair and looked quite shy,  like me. “We would like to apologize for our actions against you  earlier. Hikari-sempai. In our excitement we had forgotten the one that  Yaya-sama held most important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…most important?” I echoed questioningly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.  We have been watching Yaya-sama for a long time now. And we know that…  you, her best friend, are very important to her.” she explained, while  her and everyone’s heads remained bowed down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” I was  pretty much speechless. It really made me feel good… knowing I was  important to Yaya-chan. Well I knew it a long time ago… but I have  probably not realized just how important. For even other girls to  realize how important I am to Yaya-chan made me want to re-evaluate how  I should hold Yaya-chan as my best friend. Everyone was silent for a  while, even me. It was a bit to take in.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I then bowed to them too. “I would also like to apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari-sempai!” They called out in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t mean what I said earlier. Well… at least not the way it came  out. I just wanted Yaya-chan to eat, she hasn’t been eating quite like  she had been before… I was a little worried. I know I had offended you  as well. I am sorry.” I told them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. Please forgive us too.” said the purple haired girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have already.” I smiled as I raised my head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  took their turns thanking me and giving me personal apologies, which I  accepted. I had told them that they should probably apologize to  Yaya-chan too. The purple haired girl who introduced herself as Sakura,  told me that they were going to but Tousaka-san said that they best  apologize to me first, before apologizing to Yaya-chan. It made sense  after a while. When she explained Tousaka-san thinks that Yaya-chan  would send them to me even after they had apologized to her, before  even considering if she should forgive the girls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We soon gave  our farewells, the girls of Yaya-chan’s fan-club now headed to look for  her. It slipped my mind to tell them that Yaya-chan might be eating,  since she had not eaten much at lunch time. But they could probably  guess that, so I don’t really have to worry about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I headed to  choir practice in the church. I was late getting there, but fortunately  the leader was late as well. Which meant no one gets punished. And all  in all, practice was pretty much the same. The girls had asked about  Yaya-chan. Tsubomi-chan and I were “interrogated” separately for it,  which was a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After our practice, I found myself  staying in the church after everyone had left. I had been… avoiding  Tsubomi-chan lately. But I realized that it seemed that she was  avoiding me as well. I know that I’ve been trying not to ask her about  her date with Yaya-chan and all things with it… especially the hug she  got. I must be acting silly, I mean, I’ve hugged Yaya-chan and even  slept beside Yaya-chan… … I don’t even know what I’m thinking anymore.  Suffice to say, I don’t want to talk to her about it yet and neither  does she.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I felt a hand touch my shoulder. Which, like earlier this afternoon… surprised me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>YAAAAAAAAAA” </strong>I tried to jump away from the hand and turned to its direction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari.  It’s just me.” said the person who’s hand was still on my shoulder, who  I soon realized was Amane-sempai. I was surprised to see her here and  that she still in her school uniform… didn’t she practice riding today?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry sempai. I was deep in thought.” I felt a blush coming up to my  cheeks as I apologized. I wanted to ask why she was here… but it just  wouldn’t form.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s alright Hikari. I’m sorry for sneaking up on  you.” she said as took her hand off my shoulder. She walked a bit and  sat beside me on the church bench. “What were you thinking so deeply  about Hikari?” She asked, trying to give me the caring soft smile that  she always does.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I quickly considered telling her about  Yaya-chan, and what happened in my dreams. But then I figured that it  might be best not to… I’m not sure how she’d react. Instead I found  myself telling her about Yaya-chan’s Fan Club.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…<em><strong>to be continued.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Author’s Note: </strong></span><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And haha!
