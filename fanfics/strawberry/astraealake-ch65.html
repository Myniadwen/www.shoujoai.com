<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Obviously, I  don't own Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Arguably, though, he's a fellow  fanfiction writer, considering most of his plays are reinterpretations  of earlier sources. This has yet to win me a place alongside him in our  Literature course, though.</span></p>

Momomi grinned. “Are you ready?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Kaname replied. “It’s just reading the lines out, right? How hard can it be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you also have to read the lines out well, you see. That could be the sticking point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever.  I’ll be just fine.” Kaname smirked. “If you have time to worry about  me, you should spend it worrying about yourself, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  be fine. I’m good at this stuff, I know the play, and I wrote the  script.” Momomi smiled at her. “That’s pretty much what you’d call an  advantage. I just want to see the right person alongside me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets. “Don’t worry about it. This won’t be a problem, like I said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow that would be more convincing if I didn’t know that you haven’t even glanced at the script?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, will Amane have read the script?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  but you’re the one who had the chance. You rejected that out of  laziness, and after all the trouble I went through writing it, too.  Very hurtful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I had a lot of homework, don’t blame me. Besides, she might have got it from Olesa if she wanted. Or from you, come to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Well, that didn’t happen, so you don’t need to worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. Because even if you offered her it, she wouldn’t take it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that just because of her indifference? The thing you so love to hate about her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Regardless,  it means it’s only fair if I don’t read the script too.” Kaname nodded  severely. “It’s the only way to get an honourable result. If I beat her  by gaining an unfair advantage, it’s meaningless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You think?”  Momomi queried. “Winning at any cost and by any method sounds just fine  to me. If you have an advantage, use it. Surely you know that you have  to take what breaks you can get?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. But I also know  that I want to beat her fairly.” Kaname shrugged. “That way, I know  that I can beat the best of her kind from where I came on, without any  tricks at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you don’t read the script, it’s hardly  an even playing field, now is it?” Momomi asked. “Amane-san has  probably had training of some kind, or at least singing lessons.  Someone like you, of all people, should take whatever you’re offered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not the point, though. I need to beat her on her terms, not my own.”  Kaname smiled. “It’s obvious, isn’t it? That’s the only way I can  totally finish this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, whatever,” Momomi replied, shrugging  casually. “That still sounds like a justification for your laziness  after the fact, but you can keep it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed and frowned. “Do you think she’ll come, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who?  Amane?” Momomi cocked her head. “Probably. She did sound like she  wanted to come. But you know how it is. We can never tell with her, not  really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’d better,” Kaname growled. “The alternative would be far too annoying for words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  giggled. “That would be hilarious, actually. After all I’ve hyped it up  for you and for all your competitive excitement, she could still fail  to show and leave you stuck without any excitement. You’d be screwed  then, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bah. I’d just leave. It’s meaningless if she doesn’t take part.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Momomi asked. “And my participation means nothing to you? Too bad. I  was looking forwards to working together with you on this one... it’s a  very romantic play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Save the guilt trip for when we know whether she’s taking part or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still, you have quite the one-track mind at times.” Momomi sighed, throwing up her hands. “What am I to do with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get  used to it?” Kaname suggested. “But, you know, it’d really be her  style. Half the time, she doesn’t show any interest in what we’re doing  or fails to show, because she’s just too damn cool to waste her time  with normal people. Horses are better, it appears.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. If I  was cynical, that’d be very convenient.” Momomi chuckled. “She can  arrive at the events she knows she will win, while avoiding those where  she’d lose while maintaining her dignity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If she was like you,  yeah, that’d be the case. She’s different from you, though. She’s far  too literal and straight-forwards for her own good.” Kaname looked  around. “Room 43, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “That’s right. But  don’t idealise her too much. She’s a very enigmatic person.” Momomi  glanced at Kaname. “How much do you know about her, really? Because I  can’t rule out her using that kind of logic, myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I  said, that’s more you than her,” Kaname replied dismissively. “On her  part, such thinking would require her to think, and give a damn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  her self-proclaimed rival, you sure are charitable,” Momomi complained.  “But whatever. I don’t know quite why you get so worked up about this  stuff in the first place…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s important,” Kaname replied absently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about another bet?” Momomi suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On whether she shows or not.” Momomi cocked her head, eyes wry. “It’d be interesting, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are betting on?” Kaname asked cautiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… let’s see… how about our next date. The winner decides where we go for our next date!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t  that a punishment?” Kaname complained. “I mean, it’s hard to come up  with ideas, and things always go wrong somehow anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. It’s not that bad. The picnic was fine, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Until the thunderstorm broke and we had to run back to the school, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yeah, but we’d finished most of the food by then. Be fair.” Momomi  rubbed her cheek. “I take your point, though. The winner can get to  decide which of us has to decide? How about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just overcomplicating things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s your whining that’s overcomplicating things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. Whatever.” Kaname closed her eyes for a moment. “So? What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think she’ll come,” Momomi said. “I get that kind of feeling from her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.  I think she won’t. To be honest, she isn’t interested in anything that  doesn’t have four legs, hooves and a tail.” Kaname shrugged. “Being  proved wrong would be nice, but I doubt it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’ll see, won’t we?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stopped, frowning. “Well, we’re here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re here,” Momomi agreed. “Still no second thoughts?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bit her lip, suppressing a rising sense of apprehension. “Of course not. I’m not that weak.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  yes,” Momomi replied, opening the door and stepping through. The small  drama studio had about twenty people inside, milling around and waiting  for things to begin. Eida and Hirai were standing on the stage,  carrying clipboards. Shion, the third person with a clipboard, was  leaning against a wall in the corner, watching affairs with half-closed  eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you two did come,” Amiki observed, working towards them  and waving. “I’m almost surprised. Why are you here, Kenjou? Worried  your girlfriend will cheat on you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m here to participate,”  Kaname retorted. “So don’t expect any luck yourself, thank you very  much. We’ll be taking the juicy parts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As casual as ever,”  Amiki noted, shrugging theatrically. “It can’t be helped, I suppose.  But we’re not interested in acting. We’re going to help with the  backstage work, and right now we’re backing up those three. They have  more enthusiasm than common sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa nodded. “Well, Shion expressed her special interest in you two. So that’s hardly surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah.” Kaname shook her head. “Whatever you say. Just go and tell them that we’re here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki nodded. “Sure. I’ll be waiting, Kenjou, so don’t disappoint me.” She turned and strode off, heading for the stage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa leaned against the wall, glancing at them. “There are a fair few people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surprised?” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat. No doubt this high attendance is a result of our excellent script.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Undoubtedly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shakespeare wrote most of it, didn’t he?” Kaname asked. “So don’t take too much credit for the dead guy’s work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  hey. You can say that after you’ve spent two weeks translating a dead  guy’s work. God, that was a pain.” Momomi rubbed her eyes. “I’m still  amazed we finished it in time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa nodded. “As usual, the  weight of keeping up with their idealism fell to us. No doubt the same  thing will happen again when it comes to acting it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“However you  look at it, though, you wrote the script and turned up for this, didn’t  you?” Kaname asked. “You like it really. Denying that is pointless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I like a challenge,” Momomi replied. “But only every so often. And complaining about them is important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Yeah, like that’ll change anything. Isn’t quitting easier?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  changes something. It makes us feel better.” Momomi smiled. “But we’re  pretty much like you, Kaname. We like to pretend we’re not having fun,  even when we are, and we’re dishonest as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think we’re quite as bad as Kenjou, though,” Olesa clarified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  still find that kind of attitude annoying. People who bitch about stuff  at random are just wasting their breath.” Kaname closed her eyes and  raised her hands. “And do you ever hear me complaining about kendo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Err… yes, actually.” Momomi folded her arms, smirking. “A lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, yeah.” Kaname flushed. “But those were observations, not pointless whining. Perfectly legitimate observations!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  mean the one where you said that Kariya was a mad old hag on a power  trip? Or the one where you said Kariya was a vicious pervert who likes  watching sweaty girls in armour? Or the one where you said that Kariya  was so over-aggressive that she has to be compensating for something?  Or the one when-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, okay. Like I said, observations.” Kaname groaned. “I can’t believe you remember them all, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, your observations are always very interesting,” Momomi teased. “And very loud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it’s any consolation, Alicia does the same thing.” Olesa shrugged.  “Personally, I find it stranger that you two would volunteer to be hit  by sticks, than for us to volunteer for this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so,” Kaname replied absently. “It isn’t important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another applicant drifted in and Olesa stepped away, heading towards them. Kaname frowned. “So? What now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s just take a seat in the corner,” Momomi suggested. “Quite apart from anything else, I could do with a sit-down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded, starting to walk past the others.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One of the girls actually noticed them, nodding and smiling. “Good morning, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  morning,” Momomi replied, smiling amicably. Amazingly, several more  people greeted her before they sat down. Momomi looked from side to  side then spoke quietly. “Rather different from before, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  grunted. “You know why, though. People are finally accepting the fact  that Amane isn’t actually carved out of an ice block the Ohtori family  imported from their quarry in the South Pole.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite.” Momomi smiled. “One day, it’ll be for me, though. That’s my dream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  but isn’t it a bother in the meantime?” Kaname complained. “Random  people greeting you because of someone you know, and we’re both aware  of just how fickle they can be… I don’t know about you, but it’s just  annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little. But there are aspects of it I enjoy, too.” Momomi shrugged. “If nothing else, it’s a start, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder,” Kaname replied neutrally. She looked around one more time, examining the group. “No Amane. I win.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The audition hasn’t even started yet,” Momomi replied. “You don’t win until after we have left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t? I didn’t agree to that! I thought we were betting on whether or not she’d be in the room!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  completely different! At the very least, we’re a few minutes early. But  even then, if she’s late getting here that’s still not the same as  forgetting or not bothering about it, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “As ever, the system works in your favour. How about if she turns up by the dot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  way. That’s not fair.” Momomi shook her head. “We both know she can be  pretty late, especially if she’s busy with her horses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  groaned. “And if all she has to do is poke her head through the door  with two minutes to go, that’s hardly fair either? How about we make it  half-way through?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. Done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But still, Olesa was right,” Kaname noted. “There’s a surprising number of people…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname tapped a foot idly. <em>Well,  it’s not exactly like I’m nervous. Like I said before, that would be a  waste of energy. This should be completely straight-forwards. All I  have to do is stand up, read a section of script, then sit down. That’s  all. Any fool could do that. I don’t even have to memorise it or  anything, which would be the tricky part. And to be honest, considering  the age group, the standard’s probably going to be quite low.  Especially if Amane doesn’t show after all. I’ll be fine. No, better  than that, I’ll impress everyone. I’m sure of it. After all, I can talk  fine around my friends or even the Etoiles; it’s not like I’m a shy  person. Especially after my rants. This is just like a slightly more  poetic, pre-scripted rant. That’s all. Nothing to worry about. </em>She rubbed her stomach. <em>Everyone’s  a little nervous, but it’ll go fine. It always does, really. Besides,  this is only a crappy little school play for the lower years. It  doesn’t even matter if I screw it up. Not that I will, but still. Under  those circumstances I don’t have to be worried…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi prodded her on the shoulder. “Hey, I’m curious about something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Kaname replied distractedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who do you think is the most attractive girl in this room?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Kaname blinked stupidly. “Say what? Why are you asking that all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just curious, that’s all. Besides, we have some time to kill, don’t we?” Momomi smiled. “Well? How about it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not that stupid, you know,” Kaname noted. “It’s you, of course. I’d say  that even if we were at the Ohtori harem or whatever. I’m not suicidal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Very good. But that wasn’t it, actually? I’m curious. Out of everyone but me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  snorted. “Isn’t that a little weird? Stuff like that’s always creeped  me out. You’ll be asking me to give them numbers next…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. It’s just a little harmless fun.” Momomi smiled. “No numbers, just your gut feeling. Come on, what do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Fine.” Kaname looked around the room, briefly, not daring to linger for too long. “That one on stage. The shorter one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hirai-san? With glasses?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “She’s not bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Yeah, I can see that. Actually, her breasts are surprisingly big, for someone her age…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pervert.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were thinking it,” Momomi teased. “I just said it out loud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Whatever helps you sleep at night.” Kaname glanced at her. “How about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The tall, dark-haired one in third year. Talking to the violet haired girl and the blonde one. Yano-san, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged and smirked. “What can I say? I’m a sucker for tall, dominant females.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t probe you too hard on that,” Kaname muttered. “I just know you’ll make it an insult by the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, aren’t you suspicious? It makes me unhappy, you know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you expect me to believe your puppy-dog eye look?” Kaname asked. “It’s the most insincere thing since… hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You rejected my feelings?” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey! That was low!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But true, which is why I’m happy, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed deeply. “You’re being overly theatrical again.” She leaned back  and closed her eyes. “Oh, well. Forget it. Wake me up when they get  started…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hang on. Looks like we need to revise our judgements.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grunted, glancing as the door slid open again. “Did she turn up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etoile-sama!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think so,” Momomi replied, wincing at the squeals.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So this is the place, huh?” Kariya observed, wrinkling her nose as if she’d caught them smoking behind a shed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  Kariya, be polite,” Serané chided, gently rapping her lover’s arm.  “They’re probably all very nervous as it is. You shouldn’t make it  worse for them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Once again, it’s hard to work out who is the rude one,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know about that,” Momomi observed. “But, if I was to pick, Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya?  That gangly firebrand?” Kaname shook her head. “It disgusts me to  choose one way or the other, but it’d have to be Serané. That’s the  choice of someone with someone with taste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not so loud, they’ll hear,” Momomi warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  bowed slightly as the directors moved to greet them. “Good morning to  you all. As you’re all doing something commendable, we thought we’d  observe it. Please carry on as if we aren’t here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, thank you, Etoile-sama,” Eida said, bowing deeply. Her face was flushed with triumph.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look at Shion,” Kaname muttered. “She hasn’t moved at all. Still cool in the corner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  probably learned that from you,” Momomi noted. “But they know she’s  here, whether she runs up to them or not. That’s more her style, isn’t  it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “I guess so, even if it’s strange to me. It’s better than craving attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  we’ll sit down.” Kariya looked around, then walked in their direction.  “I’m expecting great things from you all. Don’t disappoint me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Work hard,” Serané added, smiling gently. “Participation is the most important thing, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  snorted audibly, ignoring Kariya’s trademark death glare as the woman  sat near them, folding her arms and leaning back with a controlled,  aloof presence. “Some things don’t change. Platitudes would be one of  those things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Normally, I’d agree with you, but you can learn things from losing, too, right?” Momomi smiled. “That’s something, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Losing  is losing,” Kaname retorted, glaring at her feet. “However much you  struggle, nothing changes and it’s all irrelevant. That’s why empty  statements like that are just bland encouragement for the mediocre.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really are hyper-competitive.” Momomi shook her head. “Don’t kill them or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  waited for a few more minutes, but the assembled girls had got a lot  noisier ever since the Etoiles had arrived. As far Kaname was  concerned, they’d been too loud to begin with. Now the dozen girls  circling the Etoiles like very well turned-out vultures were beyond the  pale.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eida noticed this, or perhaps she was trying to impress the  Etoiles as well. Either way, she took to the front of the stage,  coughing to indicate her desire for silence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hope she doesn’t go on too much,” Kaname muttered. “I want to do stuff once we’re through with this stupid damn thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shushed her, looking amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  their surprise, it was Shion who stood next to Eida and spoke first.  “Welcome, everyone, to the auditions for the first third-year and below  Spica play in five years. As you know, our aim is to create a high  standard play using only the lower years. As such, we’ll have a chance  to do something unusual, improve our skills for the future and have  some fun working together. It isn’t a chance that comes every day.  That’s why I want to make it as memorable as possible, so let’s all  work hard on this.” She flashed one of her trademark grins. “And if we  can upstage our senpais, that’s just gravy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eida coughed. “Well,  quite. In any case, I’m hoping to keep this short and to the point.  You’ll all be given different extracts from the scripts and a chance to  study them. Then we’ll go through in alphabetical order and have you  all perform. As it is just a play, there’s nothing but that. It should  be straight-forwards. Everyone understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s to misunderstand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi elbowed Kaname again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good. Hand out the scripts, Hirai-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!” Hirai walked down the steps, burdened with a large pile of paper, and moved between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  start in fifteen minutes,” Eida said. “Until then, look it over, take  notes and rehearse or whatever you want. Just not loudly!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  should be able to accommodate everyone here in some form. But thanks to  your enthusiasm, the top spots will be competitive.” Shion smiled  again. “So good luck, everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname took her page and grunted distastefully. “So I just have to read this out, right? Sounds pretty straight-forwards to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s a matter of performance, you know,” Momomi replied vaguely.  “Confidence and projection and tempo and that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. Whatever.” Kaname scowled. “It’s all in seriously archaic language, though. Why did you translate it so awkwardly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me for being authentic. It’s four hundred years old, you know. I had to represent that somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is the audience even going to be able to understand this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, look at it this way,” Momomi retorted. “Two foreigners <em>wrote </em>it. That being the case, I’m sure the rest of you natives will do just fine listening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so,” Kaname sighed. “Can’t say that I see the point, though. Why can’t we speak straight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  I said, authenticity, authenticity!” Momomi grumbled. “We’re trying to  make this really good, like Shion said. Changing it would kill the  beauty of the language.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t translating it do that anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes it does. Shion vetoed Olesa’s suggestion of an all-English performance, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank God for that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come in. For a school play, that’d be very avant-. We could have subtitles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  could perform in the medium of expressive dance too, but we wouldn’t  have an audience,” Kaname retorted. “Some ideas are just stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright.” Momomi sighed, flicking a lock of hair over her shoulders. “We’re really wasted on this audience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,  you wanted it in English because you’re traditionalist purists, right?”  Kaname observed. “That hardly makes you avant-garde.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, caught  by the chain-link net of logic again.” Momomi grinned. “For someone who  rarely makes much sense, you use that a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. As if you don’t puncture my ego all the damn time in turn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so. Let’s just get on with this, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grunted, reading over her page more slowly. “So, who’s this Viola chick? Looks like I have her lines.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed. “I told you about her, remember? Shows how much attention you  pay to me… one of the two twins, the protagonist, and in my opinion the  best part in the play. She’s forced to dress as a man and woo a woman  on behalf of her new master.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dresses like a man?” Kaname scowled. “I have a feeling that I’m being typecast here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a coincidence! A coincidence, already!” Momomi rubbed her forehead. “Shows how sensitive you are, though, about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really,” Kaname retorted. “So, who do you have?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me?  Oh, Duke Orsino. It could be worse. I can go with him.” Momomi ran a  finger down the page, concentrating. “I’m just glad it wasn’t one of  the comic roles. I’m not so good at that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Orsino? Who's he?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  master. I mean, Viola’s master. For the duration of the play, again.  You fall in love with me, but I’m in love with Olivia…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Olivia?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  another noble. No, wait, forget it.” Momomi groaned. “Just read the  script when you have the chance, okay? I offered it to you before, so  don’t start asking now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right, right.” Kaname looked down, reading her own speech again. “So I won’t have to know that stuff?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not. You just have to read that as best you can. It doesn’t even  have to be from the play, though it is. Anything’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, you should shut up and work harder,” Momomi warned. “I know I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.” Kaname frowned, looking round one last time. “So Amane didn’t turn up, at the end of the day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forget Amane. You have twenty-five other people to beat, okay? And that includes me. I’m the best at this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m working, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname read through the speech a few more times, then slowed down and started to mouth it quietly to herself. <em>As  I thought, the principle of the thing’s pretty simple, but the language  is complicated. I need to get that down perfectly now so I can read it  better later. With this time, fifteen minutes plus however long it  takes to get to the letter ‘K’, I should be able to memorise it as  well. This won’t be too strenuous. </em>She looked around furtively. <em>The  problem is, that goes for everyone. It doesn’t matter if I’m good. Like  this, if someone’s better they’ll get the part. That’s all it comes  down to. That’s especially true if Amane hasn’t shown and they’ve got  no cosmetic reason to give me- unwanted- preferential treatment. Well,  there are only a few serious ones. Momomi is one of them, she’ll get a  good part. And about five more are really into this stuff. They’ll  probably get important parts as well, if they’re any good. So the end  result depends on just how many major parts there are. But, even if  they’re practised, I should be quite good at this. I have a good voice,  I know that much, and I’m a fast learner. That’ll be enough for me to  do just fine, I’m sure of it.. As for the rest, they’re just here  casually. That kind of person isn’t even worth my notice, even if  they’re older. It’s a pity, really, but without Amane here Momomi is  going to dominate. Is that another one of her differences between us? </em>Kaname smirked, pushing her hair out of her eyes. <em>Don’t joke around. I’m never going to let anything like that happen again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  they started, Kaname was pleased to see that her predictions were  fairly accurate. Two girls were surprisingly shy, and clearly had  confidence problems. Others held together but didn’t make for the most  exciting listening. A few were excellent, as she’d expected of them,  but there wasn’t anyone she couldn’t find some flaw with. <em>All the same, that doesn’t mean I’ll be any better. </em>Kaname rubbed her stomach again, grimacing. <em>Blasted  nerves. The moment I get up there, I’ll be a lot better. It’s the  waiting that kills you. I wish I’d gone first, then I could sit down  and relax without having to worry about it. Instead, I have to sit here  and wait and brood. Really annoying. This is why I had my reservations  about taking part in this. For all my tough talk, it isn’t good for  nerves. Not good at all. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi touched her shoulder. “You’re on in a minute, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname emerged from her haze and nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  luck. You’ll be fine, so knock them out.” Momomi smiled broadly,  pinching Kaname on the cheek. “You’re the warm-up before my act, okay,  so don’t disappoint me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Warm-up?” Kaname muttered, smiling  back. “Are you kidding me? I’m going to go up there and steal your  thunder before you’ve even hit the stage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn right that’s so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname Kenjou-san. You’re next, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stood, feeling her legs twitch slightly and her stomach turn cold. <em>Yep,  all the blood in my lower torso have left a note telling my intestines  not to wait up and gone upstream. To my head. Which is annoying. </em>But  still, she walked to the front with a forced calm, breathing deeply for  a moment then mounting the stage. She turned to face the three  directors, mouth narrowed. “Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion smiled encouragingly. “Start in your own time, Kenjou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  noted, feeling herself relax slightly. Now was the time for action, and  she wouldn’t lose to anyone.She looked down, took a breath, then began.  “<em>There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain; and though that nature with a beauteous wall doth oft close in pollution</em>…” Her nervousness fled and she simply concentrated, working her way down the speech and throwing herself into the part. <em>This  is fine. This is good. This is great. Just keep it up, and I’ll do  well. Concentrate. Don’t get distracted. Just focus on the words. </em>And then she was finished, her ears burning, and the others were clapping politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, Kenjou-san.” Shion nodded approvingly. “That was good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. Momomi Kiyashiki-san, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  passed Momomi as she walked down, nodding and smiling encouragingly.  Momomi smiled back, apparently unfazed. Then they had passed each other  and Kaname was collapsing into her seat, sighing with relief and  relaxing visibly. <em>Now I can just sit back and enjoy the  performances, like I wanted to before. I should concentrate on what  Momomi’s doing, though. It’s bound to be good. </em>She looked up,  watching her girlfriend face the audience, and swore that their eyes  met momentarily. “Can you take my script, Hirai-san? I won’t need it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  handed over the script, then faced the audience again, her face  impassive. She spent a moment composing herself, then she began to  speak, clearly and brilliantly. “<em>Dear lad, believe it; for they shall yet belie thy happy years, that say thou art a man…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  smiled, watching Momomi fall easily into the role. She spoke slowly and  melodiously, her voice clear and deceptively loud, when it came from  such a small frame. <em>There’s no room for doubt, though. Momomi is  talented and well practised, and it shows. Compared to me, who’s merely  talented, or some of the others, who are nothing but well practised,  she’s something else. It’s beautiful to listen to, and I can’t fault  it. Off by heart, as well. As expected of Momomi, with her ability and  how well she knows the script and the play. </em>Momomi bowed briefly  to the audience when she was applauded, stepping down and walking back  towards Kaname. A few murmurs accompanied their passage. Kaname rubbed  her forehead tiredly. <em>And once again, she gets what she wants, even though Amane didn’t show. It’s always that way round, isn’t it? Hardly fair.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled as she sat down. “How did I do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  were good,” Kaname replied. “There’s no doubt, you’ll definitely get an  important role. Perhaps that Viola you go on so much about…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wonder… well, thanks, anyway. I could have done better, I think, but  this is only an audition. There’s plenty of time to perfect things  later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Enough false modesty, though. How about me? Did I do okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi grinned, prodding her on the nose. “Nervous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just curious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  did fine. You sped up a bit, because you were nervous, I think. But  that’s to be expected. Otherwise it was perfectly good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’ll  do me. Like you said, it doesn’t have to be perfect.” Kaname leaned  back, folding her hands behind her head. “In any case, it looks like  there’s nothing to do but watch now. I won’t the bet, by the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door slid open. “Is this where the play auditions are being held?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s head snapped round. “Oh, you’ve got to be fuc-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi kicked her on the shin. “Don’t say it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re late, Ohtori-san,” Eida noted. “Extremely late. I mention this by way of making conversation, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry.” Amane bowed her head. “I want to audition, but I forgot about  it until someone mentioned it to me just now. Is it too late?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not yet. We can slot you in, so take a script from Hirai and stop disrupting us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” Amane nodded, sliding the door shut and taking a seat at the back. “Once again, I’m very sorry for the disturbance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s alright, Ohtori-san,” Shion replied. “You’ll be on in ten minutes or so, though, so I suggest you get ready.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname groaned, then lowered her voice when Momomi glared pointedly at me. “You’ve got to be fucking with me,” she repeated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s good, isn’t it? You can have your competition now.” Momomi smirked. “Besides, I won the bet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? This is definitely over half-way, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it isn’t. There’s a few minute left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like hell there is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “Oh, well. We can argue about it later, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  In the meantime, though, who the hell does she think she is?” Kaname  scowled. “Striding here so late, acting cool and saying she completely  forgot it all. Talk about arrogant!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She probably just made a mistake. There’s no need to be angry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The hell she did. I’ll swear blind, this was deliberate. Her away of attracting even more attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be true if she was anything like us, but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’re taken in by her act too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know better than you. What do you know about her, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “An awful lot. In any case, this is pretty unforgivable. Just strolling in here like she owns the place…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname,  that’s enough.” Momomi touched her cheek gently. “Isn’t this what you  wanted? A victory by forfeit wouldn’t be any kind of victory after all,  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right, I guess. But it’s not like I’m annoyed  because she’s arrived.” Kaname frowned deeply, rubbing her forehead  again. “It’s because she arrived so damn late, with her attitude.  That’s the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, keep quiet about it for now,” Momomi replied. “There are still people performing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. I got it, already.” Kaname turned to glare at an oblivious Amane, who was idly flicking through her script. <em>Even  now, she’s still got that self-assured demeanour. What the hell is that  about? Learning this at such short notice, shouldn’t she be panicking?</em> She sat up in her chair, leaning forwards and placing her hands on her knees. <em>No,  I guess she’s just got good self-control. Still, I know this is going  to be good. It’s coming from her, after all, regardless of the  circumstances. But if it’s a matter of who is better in social  situations, there can’t be any doubt. I’m definitely the better  speaker, and she’s probably more nervous than me anyway. </em>Kaname sighed. <em>I just wish that she actually looked that way.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane Ohtori-san, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded, standing up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you sure you’re ready, Ohtori-san?” Shion asked. “You haven’t had very  long to practise, after all. We can do you at the end, if you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, that’s fine. The sooner the better, for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion nodded. “Then that’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  strode calmly up to the stage, standing next to the directors and  facing the audience with absolute confidence. She handed her script to  Hirai without a word. For a long moment, she just stared at the  audience, eyes sweeping calmly over them all. Kaname wondered whether  she imagined them narrowing when they passed over her. Then Amane  began. “<em>O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be inventoried</em>…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, her mouth dry, and realised something<em>. Somehow, on some level, I have never believed that Amane could act.</em><em>She’s  too literal, too straight-forwards, too plain talking and  conversationally dull. None of it suggests that she can really use her  voice at all. So even if I credited her with some talent as I credit  her with talent at everything, I didn’t really think that she’d be more  than competent. Clear and loud, perhaps, technically excellent, but  lacking something. Lacking life and soul. She’s far too diffuse and  weak a personality for me to credit her with passion. But this… this is  passion. It’s very powerful, far better than what I did, probably  better than Momomi go. </em>Kaname balled her fists and bit her lip. <em>That girl! Is there anything she can’t do, damnit! And so casually, too!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  voice was impassioned, cold, haughty, bitter and bitingly ironic.  Amane’s eyes lit up, her face was animated, and she pierced the  audience with her accusations, voice rolling over a stream of flat  descriptions then twisting viciously for the last sentence, jagged  irony.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Were you sent hither to praise me?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Loud applause. “Apparently,” Kaname muttered, folding her arms.</span></p>
