<h1>Blue-Haired Gray Eyes, Blue-Haired Brown Ones (part 1 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bblade.html">bleeding.blade</a><br> </h2>
<pre>PREFACE: I wrote this story out of a fundamental dislike for tragedy and 
an abiding obsession with aesthetic justice. After watching the entire 
Strawberry Panic series, I felt violated by the idea that two of the 
noblest, if not quite most loveable, characters in the series - Suzumi 
Tamao and Rokuj? Miyuki - would have to live the rest of their lives in 
an agony of unrequited love and unremitting loneliness. Hence, it seemed 
like a good idea to devote my first (and probably not my last fan 
fiction, given that unrequited love is a common theme in shoujo-ai 
anime) to remedy the situation. However, what was intended to be a brief 
exercise quickly morphed into an extended storyline. While I&#39;d begun 
with the intention of keeping the story short and sweet, I quickly 
discovered that the nature of Miyuki&#39;s and Tamao&#39;s characters, and the 
nature of Miyuki&#39;s specific circumstances, resisted quick and easy 
resolutions. Characters need to develop significantly if they are to 
alter the otherwise immutable trajectories of their personal tragedies. 
What made this a challenging and prolonged exercise was having to stick 
to the basic personalities and situations of the characters as they were 
found at the end of the anime series, and then finding the authentic 
seeds for their own healing from there. The result, I hope, fulfills 
your own expectations of aesthetic justice as it did mine.

WARNINGS: The story takes place after the events of the anime series, so 
spoilers do abound. More specifically, the story happens in winter, 
shortly after the Etoile selection (either late November or early 
December in my estimation), and runs until spring of the following year 
(early to late April).

NOTES: The honorifics and forms of address used in the story are largely 
based on the anime series. As for the eye colors of the various 
characters, I have used approximations. For instance, Tamao&#39;s eyes 
appear to be slate (bluish to purplish gray) while Miyuki&#39;s appear to be 
hazel (yellowish to golden brown). For the sake of simplicity, I have 
colored their eyes just gray and brown respectively.

Suzumi Tamao leans back against a tree, pen and paper in one hand, 
forehead in another. Words fail her today, as they have every day since 
the Etoile selection. Once again she is disappointed, but hardly 
surprised. She has only ever used her gift to express lightness and 
love. She has never learned - nor needed - to express anything else, 
until now. But her inner voice remains silent, mute and bewildered in 
the face of her private pain. Suzumi Tamao sighs and shakes her head. 
For her own sake, she needs to grieve. For Nagisa&#39;s sake, she cannot 
grieve too much. And now, even her ability to write poetry has abandoned 
her. She closes her eyes and breathes slowly, the momentary stillness 
giving her the respite her lost talent cannot. And then, behind her, a 
quiet voice calls her name.

&quot;Tamao-san.&quot;

~~~~~

Rokuj? Miyuki looks silently at the dejected form by the tree. She knows 
something of Tamao&#39;s feelings, having witnessed them countless times in 
her six years in Strawberry House. It&#39;s inevitable, she thinks 
dispassionately. Put the most beautiful, intelligent and accomplished 
girls in the country together and force them to live in close proximity, 
and it&#39;s impossible for hearts not to get broken. She absently touches 
her neck, fingers instinctively groping for a key not long ago returned. 
The gesture jolts her from her reverie. Rokuj? Miyuki sighs and shakes 
her head. Inevitable or not, no one deserved a broken heart. Stepping 
forward, she calls to the girl by the tree.

&quot;Tamao-san. I was wondering if you could be of assistance to me about 
something.&quot;

~~~~~

&quot;How can I help you, Rokuj?-sama?&quot;

The two women are having tea at the lounge area of Strawberry House. 
Apart from being slightly more reserved than usual, Tamao appears as 
earnest and focused as ever. It is a strength that Miyuki can respect 
and admire, though never acknowledge. She lowers her cup and regards 
Tamao steadily.

&quot;Tamao-san, I imposed on you once by forcing you to run for the position 
of Etoile with Nagisa-san. I honestly believe you could have both won, 
had circumstances not changed...suddenly. Now Amane-san and Hikari-san 
occupy the position of Etoile, but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t room 
for your skills and talents. Tamao-san, I would like you to run for the 
position of Miator Student Council President.&quot;

Tamao is startled by the request. For the past few weeks, training for 
the position of Etoile is all that has occupied her mind. She has 
forgotten that other roles exist, and that the women filling them 
currently are graduating soon. Sensing the younger woman&#39;s hesitation, 
Miyuki decides to press her case.

&quot;The fact that you qualified for the position of Etoile means that you 
are more than qualified for the position of Student Council President, 
Tamao-san. Your are intelligent and reliable and well-liked by your 
peers and elders. Obviously, Miator has a lot to gain from you being in 
this position, but there are things you can gain as well. You have great 
leadership potential, Tamao-san, but it hasn&#39;t had much opportunity to 
develop. I would consider it a privilege to be able to teach you what 
I&#39;ve learned.&quot;

This time, the surprise on Tamao&#39;s face is unmistakable. Her cheeks 
redden slightly and she bows her head towards Miyuki.

&quot;You are too kind Rokuj?-sama. I&#39;m sure I would be a burden for you to 
teach.&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s face relaxes into a small smile.

&quot;You have never been and likely never will be a burden to anyone, 
Tamao-san. Please think about my request. If you don&#39;t mind, I would 
like an answer by tomorrow.&quot;

Nodding her head at the younger girl, Miyuki stands up and leaves. Tamao 
sits for a little while longer, contemplating the blank sheet of paper 
at her side. After all, she muses, without Nagisa-chan&#39;s company or my 
poetry, I really have too much time on my hands. She picks up her cup 
and sips absently at the lukewarm tea.

~~~~~

&quot;Tamao-chan!!! I&#39;m sorry I got back so late!&quot;

Nagisa barrels into the room, breathless from her sprint through the 
halls. Tamao smiles at her friend and chides her gently.

&quot;Nagisa-chan, it&#39;s okay to come in late as long as it&#39;s before 
lights-out. I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

The last statement is a lie and they both know it. They both also know 
they cannot ever speak of it. Since the day of the Etoile selection, 
they have carefully borne the suddenly fragile raft of their friendship 
on the perilous eddies of silence and evasion. It pains them both 
tremendously, but they are young and love each other too much and know 
no other way. Nagisa looks helplessly at Tamao. The blue-haired girl 
smiles through too-bright eyes and propels her friend towards the 
bathroom.

&quot;You should hurry up and get ready for bed. Sister Hamasaka might be 
doing the rounds again tonight.&quot;

~~~~~

In bed later that night, Tamao speaks quietly across the room to Nagisa.

&quot;Nagisa-chan, Rokuj?-sama has asked me to run for the position of 
Student Council President.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s form shifts slightly on her bed. A few moments pass by in 
silence.

&quot;I think you would be a wonderful President, Tamao-chan. I honestly 
can&#39;t think of anyone else who&#39;d be a better replacement for 
Rokuj?-sama.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Nagisa-chan. That means a lot to me.&quot;

Turning in their beds, one sighs and the other cries silently to sleep. 
They have both taken steps away from each other, have both begun to 
abandon their little craft. Dawn, when it comes, brings little relief.

~~~~~

&quot;Rokuj?-sama, I have considered your request, and...I would be deeply 
honored to fulfill it. Please take me under your care.&quot;

Miyuki considers the bowed figure before her, and allows herself a small 
smile. She has never entertained the possibility of Tamao refusing her 
request. Different people dealt with heartbreak in different ways, but 
Miyuki has always believed that like herself, Tamao would choose to find 
solace in work and responsibility.

&quot;Thank you, Tamao-san. I&#39;ll be seeing you every day after school then. 
There is much to explain and not much time, so I hope you understand the 
urgency.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Rokuj?-sama. My time is at your disposal.&quot;

With that, the younger girl bows again and leaves the room. Miyuki 
watches the retreating figure and sighs. She would prefer to show more 
compassion, but knows it would be crossing a line. More intimately than 
most, she is aware of how dignity can oftentimes be the only refuge left 
to the despairing. She will not rob Tamao of any refuge the younger girl 
can find.

Chapter End Notes:
I had to invent the occasion of a Miator Student Council election given 
the absence of any references to it in the series. The idea seemed 
plausible to me given the fact that the position of Etoile is achieved 
via election as well. It also seemed reasonable to assume that Tamao, an 
incoming fifth-year student, would be qualified to run for the position 
given that Lulim&#39;s president, Minamoto Chikaru, had only been in her 
fifth year when she had occupied the post. In this story, I have set the 
Student Council elections in early January.</pre>
