<h1>Blue-Haired Gray Eyes, Blue-Haired Brown Ones (part 6 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bblade.html">bleeding.blade</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/graybrown-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>They are leaning against Tamao&#39;s tree, debating the relative merits of 
their favorite writers. Tamao treasures these spirited discussions. As 
much as she and Nagisa had shared common interests, Nagisa had never 
been her intellectual equal. Miyuki, however, is more than her equal, 
and she relishes the fact that she can talk about anything in the world 
with the older woman. It made her relationship with Miyuki, as far as 
connections on Astraea Hill went, decidedly unique.

Miyuki listens with a smile as Tamao punctuates her points with decisive 
gestures. A month had passed since the younger woman had been elected 
Student Council President. No one had contested. Tamao had been the 
natural candidate in everyone&#39;s eyes - which was why Miyuki had gone 
confidently ahead in mentoring the younger woman to begin with. In that 
relatively short span of time, Tamao had grown considerably. Leadership 
had activated her latent charisma. She was less reserved, less 
diffident, and more comfortable taking center stage. She was still 
Tamao, nonetheless, and sometimes still acted like a child in Miyuki&#39;s 
presence. Like now for instance.

&quot;I have another love letter for you, Rokuj?-sama.&quot; Tamao waves the 
letter in her senpai&#39;s face with a mischievous grin.

Miyuki tries to hide her embarrassment with a half-angry response.

&quot;Honestly, why are they giving them to me only now? Where have I been 
these last six years?&quot;

She tries to grab the letter from Tamao, but the younger girl is 
enjoying the older woman&#39;s discomfiture too much and bats her hand away. 
They tussle this way for a few moments until a miscalculated grab on 
Miyuki&#39;s part sends her crashing down against the younger woman. Lying 
against Tamao, Miyuki realizes somewhat belatedly just how much her 
prot&eacute;g&eacute; has matured - physically. The wide gray eyes are narrower, the 
cheekbones leaner, the breasts fuller, the waist slimmer, the legs 
longer. And the liquid desire in those newly narrow gray eyes is 
decidedly grown-up. Startled brown eyes look into smoldering gray ones.

&quot;Tamao-san...&quot; Miyuki breathes uncertainly.

In response, Tamao tugs on Miyuki&#39;s tie and kisses her mentor with 
sensuous abandon. Somewhere above, below, around or beyond them, a piece 
of paper rustles in the wind.

~~~~~

It is later in the afternoon; they are sitting quietly by Tamao&#39;s tree. 
The dusk is chilly, but the memory of their first kiss keeps them 
warm...and flushed. After they had pulled apart (after eons, it seemed), 
they had both been too startled to say anything: Tamao, by her own 
audacity, and Miyuki by her own blatantly passionate response. They both 
have a million questions to ask themselves, as well as the other, but 
their mutual confusion keeps them silent. Several moments pass. Then, 
unexpectedly, Miyuki begins to chuckle. Tamao looks at her mentor with 
surprise. Out of the many responses she has been anxiously anticipating 
from the older woman, she has not expected laughter. Miyuki smiles at 
the younger woman.

&quot;You have to admit, Tamao...-chan, it is a little funny. Neither of us 
expected things to turn out this way, did we?&quot;

Tamao looks at her mentor&#39;s face, searching for - and dreading to find - 
traces of irony, guilt, regret or disgust. But what she finds instead is 
tenderness, affection, amusement, and just the slightest hint of 
residual desire.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know about you...Miyuki-sama.&quot; Tamao responds nonchalantly. 
&quot;But I&#39;ve always suspected something since you hit me with that 
snowball.&quot;

Tamao scrambles away just in time, laughing, to avoid a missile thrown 
by a half-heartedly irate Miyuki.

&quot;You&#39;ve gotten too cocky for your own good, Tamao-chan.&quot; The older 
woman&#39;s grin belies the severity of her words.

Tamao replies demurely, &quot;I learned from the best, Miyuki-sama.&quot;

They tease each other all the way back to Strawberry House.

~~~~~

It is nearly midnight; a nervous Tamao knocks on Miyuki&#39;s door. They 
both know they will find the other alone tonight. For the last several 
weeks, Shizuma and Nagisa have taken to sleeping in Kaori&#39;s old room. 
For the last few weeks, they have grown accustomed to their nocturnal 
solitude. Tonight, they positively relish it.

Miyuki answers the door, dressed only in a man&#39;s nightshirt. It is the 
first time she has seen Tamao with her hair down and with her arms and 
legs bare. Although she is dressed more warmly than the younger girl, 
she shivers.

Tamao enters silently and Miyuki locks the door behind her. They stare 
at each other silently, desire slowly building in the hush, until one of 
them, they can&#39;t remember later which one, makes the first move.

Their first kisses are violent and tender; soft and brutal. Tamao feels 
Miyuki&#39;s lips, tongue and teeth on her mouth, her neck, her shoulder, 
her collarbone. Miyuki half tears the younger woman&#39;s negligee away, her 
mouth fastening on a delicate nipple. Using her tongue and her teeth, 
she nips, grazes and teases the engorged bud. Tamao whimpers, her back 
arching. Miyuki&#39;s left hand cups her other breast; the other removes the 
last of her clothing. A hand slips in between the younger girl&#39;s thighs, 
fingers slipping easily between the damp folds. Tamao moans and begins 
to move her hips rhythmically. Slowly, Miyuki&#39;s mouth and tongue abandon 
her breasts, and inch their way across her belly and thighs. Tamao 
begins to beg.

&quot;Miyuki...please...&quot;

The brazen intimacy of hearing Tamao say her name without the honorific 
snaps the last of Miyuki&#39;s restraint. Her tongue flickers lightly at the 
juncture of Tamao&#39;s thighs causing the younger girl to gasp and moan. 
With bolder strokes, she tongues the younger girl, sucking, licking and 
biting gently in turns. Then she slowly inserts a finger into the girl, 
timing the thrusts with the motions of her tongue. She can feel the 
younger girl&#39;s virgin tightness clenching around her finger, and inserts 
another. By this time, Tamao is thrashing helplessly, wildly, bucking 
against Miyuki&#39;s mouth and hand and moaning Miyuki&#39;s name. Her body 
clenches one last time, then releases itself in a long, spasmodic 
shudder. When she comes to, seconds or eons later, she can&#39;t tell which, 
she hears Miyuki&#39;s throaty chuckle in her ear.

&quot;Punishment for insubordinate behavior, Tamao-chan. And it seems I&#39;m not 
just good with snowballs.&quot;

Tamao pushes the older woman onto her back, gray eyes glinting with 
mischief.

&quot;You forget, Miyuki-senpai, how good a pupil I am.&quot;

They hardly sleep at all that night.

~~~~~

Miyuki awakens to the sensation of lips and tongue slowly working their 
way down her belly. As she stirs, Tamao stops her ministrations long 
enough to greet her a mischievous good morning.

&quot;Miyuki-chan. I&#39;m just about to have breakfast in bed.&quot; Miyuki closes 
her eyes and moans as Tamao&#39;s tongue and fingers disappear between her 
legs. It is going to be a gloriously long Saturday morning.</pre>
