<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>Momomi winced,  raising one hand to try and shield her face. The other was still  tightly clutching her mobile phone, as if her life depended on it. If  this continued to happen, her life probably would depend on it. </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stupid bitch!” Amiki exclaimed, looking annoyed. “Fight back, why don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There’s no point. I can’t fight. I’m weak, not strong like Kaname. It can’t be helped any more. But… it hurts. </em>Momomi took a deep breath. <em>I  just have to hold on. If I don’t fight back, she’ll get bored sooner  and go away. Then I can go find Kaname and Shion. They’d better be  waiting up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa watched her, frowning slightly as Amiki  continued unabated. “You have no spine at all,” Amiki said, hoisting  Momomi up by the collar. “Clever words, that’s all you have, but  nothing to back it up. I hate people like you.” She was slapped  repeatedly then thrown against the tree again. Amiki tripped her and  she fell hard, sprawling across the ground and protecting her face with  her free hand. She struggled to rise, holding her phone in the other as  if it was her last hold on sanity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Check her pockets,” Olesa ordered quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Shit. </em>Momomi  tried to fight back for the first time, raising both hands and flailing  ineffectively at Amiki, but the girl caught both her arms and gestured  for one of the other girls to move in and frisk her. Out came a  handkerchief, a spare pen, her purse and, of course, her phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa’s face twitched instantly, but she schooled her expression. “Give me that,” she said, pointing to the mobile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a good idea,” Amiki agreed, grabbing it and holding it up. “Looks quite  expensive. And it’s completely wasted on this asocial little girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give that back!” Momomi struggled impotently, landing a kick on Amiki’s shin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  want it?” Amiki sounded amused. She held it above Momomi’s head,  letting the brown-haired girl struggle foolishly. “What’s so important?  Who’re you gonna call? Her girlfriend? Yeah, right… she’s not here to  rescue you now, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You bastards!” That was what someone  screamed. It wasn’t anything to do with fear or shock or panic. It was  the kind of scream that made other people afraid, shocked and panicked.  It wasn’t a war cry, exactly, because that implied values beyond  hatred; rather, it was the essence of a war cry congealed into a thick,  throaty shout that echoed in the mind long after the actual words had  come to rest. <em>That would be how Kaname would put it, anyway. I’m  more worried about the fact that she’s going to bring the whole school  running here.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki dropped the phone and started to move  towards Kaname, but she didn’t have more than a second to react before  the taller girl jumped, practically landing on top of her and knocking  her off-balance. She punched Kaname several times in the face but the  girl didn’t even notice, kicking Amiki repeatedly in the legs then  knocking her over with a single punch to the nose. “You bastards!” she  screamed. “I’m going to slaughter you all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No need,” Momomi gasped, falling to her knees. “But could you find my phone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you did come after all.” Amiki stood and faced down the ragged  blue-haired girl. “Have to look after your girlfriend, don’t you?” She  turned to the others. “Come on, it’s four on one!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You made my day,” Kaname said hoarsely, throwing herself forwards without a moment’s thought.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  this isn’t strictly necessary,” Momomi muttered, throwing her hands  over her head as Kaname slammed into the first girl, sending her  staggering backwards to trip on a prone Momomi. She tried to move away  before the girl could take it out on her, scrabbling across the floor  for her phone. <em>If someone treads on it…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname, overhead,  fought like a human whirlwind, offering no quarter at all and fighting  without inhibition or restraint. Ultimately, that was her edge. She was  faster and stronger than any of them while there were four of them and  she was alone. But they hesitated, punching badly and getting in each  other’s way, hating to approach her and her promise of pain. Kaname  fought without caring or even noticing that she was hurt. It wasn’t  important. It didn’t matter how badly she got hurt. The important thing  was that she hurt them and hurt them and hurt them, far more than they  were hurting her, never giving them a chance to think or breathe,  always fighting on using instincts alone and any methods. She punched,  kicked, scratched, pulled their hair, tripped them; she would have  bitten them if there had been any chance for that. She didn’t need to  be elegant. She just had to win. That was what fighting meant, and a  bunch of rich schoolgirls would never know that simple fact.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  crawled across the floor, hoping no one would notice her. She looked up  at the wrong moment and caught a bloodied Kaname headbutt Amiki,  sending the girl staggering back. Another of the girls grabbed Kaname  from behind, but she simply threw her head backwards instead, then  twisted and tore the girl off, kicking her in the knee until she folded  over. The others were hitting her, Amiki ran at her and hit her in the  waist, knocking her over, but Kaname kicked and twisted like a snake,  punching again and again until the girl was forced to let go. She rose  to her feet again, the other girls visibly taking a step back as she  raised her hands again. But Amiki came up from behind, pulling her into  a chokehold and yet another struggle. <em>That bitch is impressive. But  Kaname… she’s amazing. She’s being hurt so much, but it’s like she  doesn’t even notice. She’s unstoppable. But.. why? Why she’s going so  far?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was when she noticed Olesa, kneeling down to pick  up the phone. She yelped and threw herself forwards, landing on top of  the girl and knocking them other. They struggled furiously, scratching  at each other and rolling across the ground. Momomi managed to tear the  phone free of her grasp but Olesa grabbed her before she could escape,  pushing her down again and slamming her palm repeatedly into the  ground. “You bitch,” Momomi whispered, dropping the phone and fighting  back with both hands. She managed to get a grip on Olesa’s hair,  pulling it hard, but the girl replied by scratching her face with  surprisingly vicious nails. <em>This is so inelegant. </em>That would be Momomi’s thoughts looking back. But in the meantime, she wasn’t thinking at all, only reacting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  charged one girl down, punching her repeatedly in the stomach,  following through with a full-on blow to the solar plexus then slamming  her into a tree by the neck. The girl collapsed, whimpering, but Amiki  threw herself at Kaname again, throwing her in turn into the tree. She  grabbed the back of Kaname’s head and slammed it forwards, only for  Kaname to turn and punch back, forcing her to retreat to give space.  “Bitch!” Kaname spat, turning a horribly bruised face and running  headlong at Akimi. By now, the other girls were too injured and too  intimidated to fight. They were alone. She threw a straight punch at  Amiki’s face, but somehow the girl found the reflexes to move sideways,  dodging the attack and driving her own fist in Kaname’s stomach. She  gasped for breath, but fought back anyway, throwing her extended arm  sideways and elbowing Amiki in the forehead, then turning and kicking  at her shin. The girl stepped back, face bloody, and raised her fists  as Kaname surged forwards again. This time, though, Kaname threw  herself forwards, rugby-tackling the girl before she could move away.  Amiki punched her repeatedly in the head, but Kaname pressed forwards,  headbutting Amiki again and reaching in to throttle the girl into  submission. However, she herself got punched in the neck, winding her  and giving Amiki a second to slip free. They both moved clear and  stood, facing each other again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow, Momomi ended up on her  back, kicking blindly at Olesa, who was doing something similar in  retaliation. The net effect was that of two babies having a temper  tantrum, only the babies in this instance were the size of teenage  girls. A particularly hard blow pushed them both clear, then their  brains re-engaged and they both scrambled up, searching for the phone.  But Momomi was far worse off, her legs almost folding under her. She  could only watch in impotence as Olesa reached for the phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  foot slid down in front of it, blocking Olesa’s part. “Looking for  this?” Shion said pleasantly, leaning down and picking it up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa looked up at the senpai apprehensively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my. No, this is Kiyashiki-san’s phone. But you’re a very graceful girl for picking it up, Perez-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Interesting,” Amiki said, breathing deeply. “I’ll ask you one more time. Where did you learn to fight like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll return that question,” Kaname retorted, eyes still livid. “But I’ll ask your corpse!” The two girls charged again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” a voice screamed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Both  girls slid to a halt instantly, looking around. Red hair, the colour of  still-moist blood, pale skin, red eyes and aquiline features, all  shocking against the restraint of Miator’s black. That was what they  saw in an instant, to their considerable discomfort. “Kariya-sama,”  they chorused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you dare <em>Kariya-sama </em>me under these circumstances!” the Etoile shouted, red in the face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, Kariya-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  of you are disgraces!” Kariya continued, apparently without breath.  “I’m disgusted beyond belief by your behaviour. Is this Spica’s idea of  discipline?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can explain everything, Etoile-sama,” Shion said,  cut to the quick by the comment about Spica. “This is a simple case,  and evidence we have right here will prove-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do I look like I care for an explanation?” Kariya demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, Etoile-sama.” Shion wilted under her gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  snorted, folding her arms and looking scornfully at them all, one by  one. “All I see is two groups of students brawling like commoners. How  dare you lower yourselves like this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me,” Kaname muttered through swollen cheeks. “Not all of us have lofty upbringings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  cut her dead with a glare. “You have no right to speak! You may think  your background excuses everything, Kenjou, but you’re wrong! You are  expected to follow and exeed our standards, precisely because you are  unusual here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is my fault,” Momomi tried. “Kaname was just defending me. It’s not her fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  turned and roasted with her gaze, opening her mouth for a moment, only  to turn her attention on the gathering crowd. “Go away!” she shouted.  “This isn’t theatre!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girls dispersed as if they’d been strafed by a flame-thrower.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané emerged from the trees like a guardian angel. “Kariya, shall we leave it here for now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  should we be so soft?” Kariya asked. “They deserve far more than this,  and I intend to give them it. Only pain and fear serves with this kind  of person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané smiled sweetly, cocking her head.“Well, <em>perhaps. </em>But  they’ve been hurt rather a lot. I think we should take them to the  infirmary in the meantime. Ishii-san, Tou-san, Sai-san, can you gather  some students and deal with it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Etoile-sama.” The sixth-years hurried after the crowd, which had reformed a healthy distance from Kariya.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Kariya murmurred, looking satisfied. “We can let them heal first. Then we can punish them terribly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly,” Serané replied, somewhat uncertainly. “I’m sure we can get to the bottom of this in the time, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so. I don’t know who started what, or why, but I can promise  you this.” She smiled. “By the time I’m finished with you you’ll wish  that I’d merely given you a second set of bruises.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, now, Kariya, I think they’re sufficiently chastened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The red-head snorted. “There’s no such thing. Look at these two, Kenjou and Rivera. Habitual criminals.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think they’re actually criminals, Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t we convict them for assault? We should be able to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think we have to, though, Kariya,” Serané said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,”  Kariya said, as if testing the concept. “I suppose so. No, that’s  probably for the best, the police aren’t very efficent. But they’ll be  punished horribly. Funny timing, though, Kiyashiki. Having fun now  you’re leaving?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san’s departure is not  cast in iron, Kariya.” Serané walked forwards, touching her partner  lightly on the shoulder. “I don’t think it has anything to do with  this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should hope so.” But Kariya looked mollified nonetheless. “In any case, shall we leave this to the others?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds like a wonderful idea, Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, let’s go, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked around, trying to find whoever the hell had responded to that  name, only to see that Kariya had already stalked off, Serané happily  in tow. “Wait, wait, wait. <em>Shizuru?</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think she meant Serané.” Momomi shrugged. “Who knows with her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably  Kariya’s ham-fisted attempt to translate or at least capture the spirit  of the name Serané,” Shion suggested. “It’s the kind of endearing  diminutive-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you, I’ve stopped caring.” Kaname sighed deeply, cursing all downright weird student leaders.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Totally,” Momomi said. “You should try not to sound too much like a dictionary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  trying to work out who does it better,” Shion mused. “Kariya and  Serané, or you two. Either part could pass for some kind of comic  double act.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I’m not the only one who’s noticed that those  two talk and act like the school’s most famous couple.” Amiki looked  pointedly between the two of them. “The dumb fighter and the ladylike  thinker.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed sarcastically. “Doesn’t that go for you and your girl too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least we have communication,” Momomi continued. “Olesa doesn’t say a thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no need for her to speak.” Amiki stretched carelessly. “Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  there will be soon enough.” Shion smiled happily at her. There was just  a hint of irony there, though… “This will all be dragged out into the  light.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever,” Amiki said. “I’m not the one who laid three girls out in an assault, or the one who’s leaving in a few days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. I’m not going anywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After  this? Let’s face it, you didn’t exactly come out smelling of roses,”  Amiki said. “What were you babbling about earlier, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just guesswork,” Momomi said. “I don’t know why you follow Olesa, but you should be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really don’t know anything, do you?” Amiki said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, it does seem that way,” Shion said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before the blonde could say any more, they were arrested by a swarm of enthusiastic students.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks like I screwed up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said I screwed up,” Kaname said loudly. She leaned back on her bed  looked at the ceiling. “I’ve made things very difficult for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  fine,” Momomi assured her. “You protected me. I’m glad of that.” She  glanced sidelong at her companion, who was a mess of bandages. “Though  you haven’t learned any more self-preservation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That Amiki,”  Kaname said with a hint of embaressment. “She’s not normal. No way. She  can fight like I can… that means she’s something far different from you  aristocrats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d thought you’d have noticed that after the fifth time she blackened your eye,” Momomi said. “Shion knows, but we don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That useless girl.” Kaname scowled irritably, her free hand curling into a fist. “Does she ever do anything at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She retrieved the most important thing,” Momomi said, holding up her phone. “Though it didn’t go quite as well as I’d hoped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  managed to make Olesa commit herself out loud,” Momomi explained. “I  said a load of things. I’ve no idea whether any of it was actually  true, but I annoyed her enough for this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Kaname closed her eyes. “That’s quite useful. A sneaky method, as expected of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  like I said, things aren’t ideal.” Momomi paused for a moment. “But my  position’s workable, I think. By the way, what we do know is that Olesa  and Amiki are both from Spain. I suspect Amiki’s just an adopted name,  not her real one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes. But what’s their relationship? That’s something I’m curious about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve no idea,” Momomi said. “It’s something we’ll work out later. But not now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her phone beeped. She looked at the display and smiled. “Aha. So we begin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry?” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion’s  being useful. I presume this is Olesa’s number. God knows how she got  it. Well, we have a lot to talk about.” She punched in the number and  raised the phone to her ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Hello, Kiyashiki-san.” </em>Olesa’s voice as impassive and accentless as always.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll cut to the chase, shall we?” Momomi said. “Only half an hour till we have to face them all, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Understood.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  I’m seriously pissed off, and I could just throw Amiki into trouble  again. But that’s too easy. This time, I can get you. You know why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>My record is considerably more robust than yours, Kiyashiki-san.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  won’t help,” Momomi said. “This is enough. You know that. Even if you  could talk your way out, I doubt your sidekicks will be as loyal and  blind as Amiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Her name is Rivera-san.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you  do care a little about her… just a little. But how about what I said  earlier? Was I on the money? Because you can keep Amane or becoming an  Etoile, I’d hold your coat if you wanted to chase after her or the  title-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That isn’t within the terms of the discussion. You said it yourself, we have little time. What do you want?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why would I want anything? Aren’t you the one who wants something here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If I had nothing you didn’t have, we would not be having this conversation.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smart girl,” Momomi said. “Alright, we’ll talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>This is about your purported departure, is it not?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  sharp. As I should expect of you, you aren’t stupid. In any case,  you’re right. My parents want me to leave. I don’t want to leave.  That’s the situation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Without money or parental consent you stand no chance.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about that stuff. That’s my area. I want you and Amiki at my  disposal for this, though. We can use you for something. Making tea,  perhaps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>And in return?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll creatively  reinterpret the truth of the affair in the forest. You and I alike will  come out as victims of circumstance. Kaname and Amiki… Rivera-san, will  come out as well as can be managed. As for the rest… do you even care?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I suspect they’re finished with me. There’s no point in making pointless sacrifices.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. So, my silence on your actions in return for your help. How does that sound?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That’s  not good enough. Even after this, you’ll still be able to blackmail me  at your leisure. The deletion of the evidence- that has to be a  condition of my involvement.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not exactly in a position to dictate terms, Perez-san,” Momomi chided. “I’m not the one who has been a very bad girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>While  I would be damaged, your evidence is slim. I would not be kicked out of  this school, but you stand to be. That would please me greatly, indeed  I would do my best to facilitate it. Unless you satisfy my terms. I’m  not so stupid as to be blackmailed and then exposed at your leisure.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smart girl, but my evidence’s value will decay with time anyway. It’d just make me suspicious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>It would not be difficult to paint that as me silencing you. I could do that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  well,” Momomi said. “Compromise. I’ll give you my phone after it’s  certain I’ll still be at school. You can delete anything you find  compromising. Agreed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa hesitated for a beat. <em>“That will be satisfactory.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  now it’s time for creative writing,” Momomi murmurred, tapping a finger  against her chin. “We have a chance meeting in the forest, and argue. I  bait Ami… Rivera-san. I’m stressed out from this whole leaving school  thing, which is true enough. She snaps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That’s best. We don’t have much room to manoeuvre. But make the insults credible.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will  do, trust me, I’m not short of ideas. Kaname intervenes, but she’s a  little overzealous. Hence the massive punch-up. That simple no mention  of the unprovoked bullying or your ringleader role. Aren’t I nice?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You are pragmatic.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about your end?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Rivera-san will make it clear to my so-called sidekicks.</em> <em>Don’t worry about that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perfect.  I’m glad we can do business, even if I do hate your guts. Now we just  thresh out the details.” Momomi leaned back and stretched in a catlike  manner, ignoring the pain in her limbs. She loved this game.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  watched her, trying to relax and feel less uneasy. She hadn’t caused  any permanent problems. Besides… whatever was going on, she still had  no intention of forgiving either Olesa or Amiki. They’d hurt her  Momomi, and they’d come to regret that. <em>Picking on a weak, defenceless girl at a time like this… unforgivable. </em>But, with effort, she said nothing until Momomi was finished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There.” The girl folded up her phone with a satisfied sigh. “That’s good business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I never knew you were intro this negotiations stuff. I’ve got no time for it, myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s pretty easy when you can anticipate what the other person’s going  to do,” Momomi replied with affected modesty. “I can deal on the same  level as Olesa, so it’s simple enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know how you can  bear to, after earlier,” Kaname said. “She hurt you so much, not to  mention me rather a lot as well. I’m still furious about that. She’s  our enemy, goddamnit! She’s a maniacal, inexplicable egotistic bitch  who sets her lackeys on us for no decent reason!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I think I’d do the same thing in her place,” Momomi said. “Don’t get me  wrong, mind. I’d do a lot better. But if I really cared about that  stuff… Olesa would be my rival.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t mean I’m going to forgive her this way round. Amiki wouldn’t either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re comparable as pairs, aren’t we?” Momomi looked at Kaname thoughtfully. “Or at least allies of convenience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what happens when you get to stay? You said you might take more interest in ‘that stuff’, as you put it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I agree with what you want,” Momomi said. “In that situation, it would  be necessary to take on Olesa, and beat her. I think she knows that  too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed and nodded. “I understand. But remember, I’m  not Amiki. I’m not your lackey or anything weird like that. Once your  position here is guaranteed, once I’ve put one over your father, things  are going back to the way they were before. I hope you understand that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Momomi assured her. “I wouldn’t forget that. And I wouldn’t look  down on you. It’s not like I’m too happy with you saving my ass like  that earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about? I just brought you a  lot of trouble.” She flicked a finger discontentedly. “After you told  me not to fight, too. Its not like I need your permission or anything,  but this hasn’t done us any favours. I won’t do anything else, though,  my pride demands this much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s given me several valuable  chances. I was able to blackmail Olesa. And we have a cast iron reason  to talk to both Serané and Kariya. It’s not an ideal situation, but a  chance is a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right,” Kaname muttered. “Kariya just wants to get off on punishing me excessively again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably,”  Momomi agreed, smiling thinly. “But… I do want to thank you. I didn’t  know you cared so much for me, as you really gave it your all. I can  admire that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wasn’t for you,” Kaname said angrily. “I just  hate people like that, picking on soft targets. Besides, I have my own  axe to grind with them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “I know. I was just teasing you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re in a good mood,” Kaname said sourly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know why. I feel terrible. Everything aches. But… I guess, for  the first time, I’m beginning to think we really can do it. You’re an  inspiration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Kaname said, sounding completely  assured. “There’s nothing the two of us can’t do. I don’t have to like  you to admit that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, yeah,” Kaname said. “I  have this.” She pulled her special plans out of her pocket, noting how  ragged they’d become. Well, her blazer was damaged too. She’d need to  get a new one, <em>again. </em>The suppliers would not be happy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  been working out what we need to do in order to maximise our chances,”  Kaname said meditatively. “It’s just like warfare. Everything’s about  dividing the enemy and striking where it’s least expected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?” Momomi leaned back, smiling with interest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, first of all, you need to phone your father right away, and apologise,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Why the hell would I do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you can’t see that, you must really hate him,” Kaname said. “A man like  him is the sort of person you should find easy to manipulate. If he’s  convinced you’re challenging his authority and want to stay, he’ll just  become intractable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine as far as it goes. But the thing is, I am challenging his authority and I do want to stay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You,  of all people, aren’t bound by the truth,” Kaname pointed out. “All you  have to do is phone up, say you’re sorry, and that you need a little  time to think. You didn’t mean to lose your temper. Right? And speak in  Italian or whatever, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…” Momomi began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But what?” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t just say I’m going home,” Momomi said. “That won’t work at all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not what we’re doing. Apology, not retraction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And… well… you know… there’s such a thing as pride,” Momomi finished lamely. “Don’t you, of all people, know about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled this time. “Alright, whatever. If your pride is worth more than continuing to be in this room, that’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have to put it that way,” Momomi said, puffing out her cheeks indignantly. “I get it, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is my role,” Kaname said thoughtfully, raising a hand and looking at the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I say the things you don’t want to hear,” she continued. “You say the things that I don’t want to hear. Something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  cocked her head, considering. “I suppose so. It helps that we’re  willing to consider almost anything, between us. There’s a lot to be  said for a life without inhibitions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally. That’s the  difference between a strong foe and a weak one, you know. It’s why I  find this place so laughable. You aristocrats are so preoccupied with  manners and politeness and titles… you can never go all out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you really think that, you’re just fooled by the smokescreen,” Momomi  said. “Serané’s kind is the exception, not the rule, and even they have  steel in them. We’re a savage and calculating bunch. We just hide it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then how about here? It’s a hopeless dreamworld. One that you’re clinging to, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s a dreamworld with interesting people in it,” Momomi said, looking  sidelong at her friend. “But it’s a dreamworld because of that life.  We’ve discussed this before, really, but we try to escape from dreary  destinies. I mean, take Serané and Kariya. The perfect couple, provided  you don’t take your Catholicism too seriously. But when they leave here  they’ll probably be separated forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I find that hard to believe. Neither of them would just lay down and die in life like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hope so. But it always comes to that battle. Between parents and  children. You’re lucky, perhaps the one think you’re lucky in, Kaname,  is that you’ll never have to fight that battle. Not in the same way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Kaname said. “Well, it’s a freedom won at the expense of a home life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In some ways, it’s Serané I feel for. For us, even being disinherited is tolerable… but she actually cares about her family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  expect me to feel too sorry for her, not when you look at what they’ve  given her,” Kaname replied cynically. She folded up the rest of her  plan. “Well, we can talk about the rest later. I’m tired now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked at Kaname for a few moments before she spoke again. “How did you learn to fight like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?” Kaname replied. “It’s just street fighting with a bit of martial arts thrown in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  that,” Momomi said. “You fight hard and you don’t care about your own  pain. You don’t give up, you don’t slow down, you don’t hold back… what  am I trying to say? I guess, that you have conviction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Conviction?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When you’re ready to fight, you’ll fight to end,” Momomi said. “You’re strong emotionally and physically. I… envy that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  snorted. “You shouldn’t be too impressed by that. It’s nothing to do  with any kind of strength. Just my father, too many street fights and  repetitive action.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. I know it’s not something I should envy. But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  though I’m grateful- because I’m grateful- if that happens again,”  Momomi said. “Leave it be. You don’t have to intervene for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her for a second. “I thought so,” she grunted. “I was getting in the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not it. That’s not it at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just… it’s just that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted again, closing her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just that you’re going to get hurt again, you jerk!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname, blinked turning to look at the brown-haired girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glowered back, looking flustered and irritated with herself and Kaname  alike. “You really can’t look after yourself, and you’re too stupid to  be able to control yourself in a fight. You’re really clueless. You  fought even though it was four on one! Even for you, that’s just way  too dumb. And even though you’re strong and your body heals fast, one  day you’re going to push yourself too far, and be hurt permanently. One  day you’ll just scream and run in the stupid way you do and lose. So…  so… you shouldn’t try and do cool things like protect me any more. It’s  just too reckless. I don’t mind being hurt, I know I can’t fight and  I’m good at not fighting. So don’t worry about me or Olesa or vengeance  or whatever. Worry about yourself instead. That’s what’s important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed out loud, closing her eyes and smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s so funny?” Momomi demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing. But neither of us are very honest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you suggesting?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing.”  She flicked an errant strand of blue hair out of her eyes. “But thanks  for your concern. I’ll bear your advice in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good. You’d better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  doesn’t mean I intend to follow it,” Kaname said sharply. “If Olesa’s  the foe… I’d rather but cut a thousand times than let you be hurt.  You’re right, I don’t care how badly I’m injured. I’ll use this body  marked by fighting to protect you from the battles you’ve never learned  to fight. You’d better get used to that, it’s what Kaname Kenjou’s  decided.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot,” Momomi said. “That’s just what you always do, only caring about your own feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps  it is selfish,” Kaname said. “Perhaps you’d like it if I held back. But  I’m not at the point where I can restrain myself. I don’t care enough.  I can’t see that changing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll teach you,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  teach you the reasons why you should protect yourself, not just me,”  Momomi said. “Heck, I’ll smack it into your thick skull with a hammer  if I have to! But I’m not going to let you do just anything with  yourself. That’s what Momomi Kiyashiki’s decided.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess we really are eternal enemies,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right. But…” She frowned to herself. <em>It’s kinda nice, to have an enemy like this.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname, for her part, turned over and faced the wall, thoughtful and uneasy in the sudden silence.</span></p>
