<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>“Welcome,  everyone. It’s good to see you all.” Shion smiled gently, looking  around. “We know a lot of you have clubs around this time, or else your  own free time, so we’re glad you’re committed enough to sacrifice that  time to work on this.”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That said, it’s also what we expect of you,”  Eida warned. “You’d better be here at this time every time we have a  meeting. Remember, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays! We don’t have a lot  of time to learn the whole thing. But if you’re here, you’ve made a  commitment to see it through. I’ll enforce it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. “Good cop, bad cop, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How stereotypical…” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  just stood close by, looking up at the stage with complete  indifference. Momomi glanced at her in amusement for a second, then  returned her attention to Shion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, the first thing is  to familiarise yourselves with the script,” Shion explained. “This  isn’t something you can ad lib, after all. Hirai-san, could you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-yes…”  Hirai stammered. “Eh, basically, we’re dividing the cast into two, the  main plot and the comedy… well, you all know who you are. After that,  you’ll be put into small groups based on what part of the play you’re  involved in, and you’ll practise your lines in those groups… we’ll move  between you and make sure everything’s okay, and help if you need it…  that’s all. Is that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even Momomi found herself nodding. <em>There’s  something about Hirai that protects her from even the coldest person.  But really, insulting someone this shy and fragile would just be in bad  taste.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted quietly behind her, folding her arms impatiently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Though some people are less kind than others are, I suppose. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you, Hirai-chan.” Eida glanced at them all. “So that’s the program.  After about a week of this, we’ll get on with proper rehearsals. The  groups, Hirai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh… yes…” Hirai raised a clipboard, nervously  looking down at it. “Well, Viola, that’s Ohtori-san, Valentine,  Araki-san, and Orsino, who is Kanda-san, are one group. You’re working  on the early scenes. Olivia, Kiyashiki-san, Maria, Murai-san, Fool,  Nagasawa-san and Malvolio, Koike-san, on the first half of Act 1 scene  5. Sebastian, Kenjou-san, and Antonio, Nagai-san, on the early part of  Act 2 scene 1. Toby is Tou-san and Andrew Uemura-san, who will be  working on Act 2 scene 3. Uh… that’s all for now. The rest will be with  Eida-san, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trust Shion and her associates to  overcomplicate things?” Kaname complained. “Can’t we just start and go  through the whole play, without any of this annoying differentiation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m sure it will be good for you,” Momomi replied. “Just bear with it, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eventually,  after the usual confusion that accompanied these events, Momomi found  herself sitting in a circle with several other girls they barely knew.  Shion stood over her shoulders, an angel shaking a dainty finger in  warning. “Now, be good, especially you, Kiyashiki-san. It’s in your  hands, Nagasawa-san. I’m counting on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not a problem,” the third-year replied easily. “But why her in particular?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’ll  say malicious and strictly untrue things at the drop of a hat,” Shion  replied. “It’s very hurtful. But she’s mostly reasonable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, good luck, everyone.” Shion waved slightly, then walked towards another group.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  here we are,” Nagasawa remarked. “I guess it’s best if we introduce  ourselves first. I’m Terue, Terue Nagasawa, third year. I’m one of  Eida’s friends. I like acting and poetry and I hate swimming. That’s  all. It’s good to meet you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m Etsu Murai! First year! I  like flowers, dresses and baseball! I hate lessons and homework.” Murai  smiled. “That’s all! Something like that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagasawa nodded. “That’s right. Thank you.” She glanced at the other second year. “And you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike leaned back, yawning slightly. “Hmm? Asayo Koike. What I like or dislike’s irrelevant, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so, but it’s nice, isn’t it?” Nagasawa pointed out patiently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch…  fine. Well, I like kyudo. I dislike bullies and people who are too  loud.” Koike shrugged languidly. “Like that has anything to do with  drama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What can I say? I can see why she was chosen to play Malvolio…though I suspect Kaname’s answers sound exactly the same.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you don’t need much introduction, Momomi Kiyashiki.” Nagasawa glanced  at her, eyes amused. “You used to be a troublemaker, I haven’t  forgotten that. You just came from washing the Church as a punishment  for fighting, for example.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My,” Momomi replied evenly. “You’re surprisingly well-informed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tomori-san’s told me a little about you as well, of course. You’re a good actor, by all accounts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi met her eyes. <em>Just how good a friend are you to Shion? And just what kind of acting are we talking about, I wonder? </em>“Of course,” she replied. “It’s to be expected of a Phareli.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagasawa smirked, looking cynical. “I see. In any case, you should introduce yourself. I’ve rather stolen your thunder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki  Momomi, though my father’s name and family is the Phareli of Italy.”  Momomi smiled. “I like artistic things and flowers as well, but I  dislike bigots and uninformed idiots of all kinds. I’m looking forwards  to working with you all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You come from Italy?” Murai asked, looking impressed. “Are you a foreigner?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Koike replied. “Didn’t you notice? The hair’s a give-away in itself… everyone knows.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The foreign transfer student with that Kenjou… right?” Keiko smiled. “An interesting person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you’d be Koike, as in the Kochi Koike, no?” Momomi smiled back, eyes  lingering on the other girl. “I thought the name was familiar. My  mother told me all about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. We’re honoured, to have come  to the attention to the great Phareli,” Keiko mocked. “Though why a  Phareli should be here, not there, and under this name-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough, isn’t it?” Nagasawa said, sighing. “Isn’t that stuff just tedious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Says the only daughter of the Iwate Nagasawa family, of course…</em>Momomi nodded. “In any case, I’m half-Italian half-Japanese. But to be honest, I prefer it here. That’s why I’m here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow,” Murai said. “Aren’t you a long way from home, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  practical terms, not much further than you are, right?” Momomi pointed  out. “We’re all boarding school students here, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.  But in any case, we’ve wandered pretty far off topic,” Nagasawa noted.  “We should begin. You all have your scripts, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.” Koike finally condescended to sit normally and pull out her script. “Let’s get started, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you wrote this, didn’t you, Kiyashiki-san?” Murai noted. “Amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I hardly wrote it, just translated it, that’s all,” Momomi replied,  with a mostly insincere modesty. “And I was helped by Perez-san as  well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be that as it may,” Nagasawa said firmly. “We have to begin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  Momomi’s intense surprise, they actually worked quite well together.  Nagasawa was fairly decent at motivating them and Murai was  ridiculously enthusiastic to begin with. More than that, she could take  criticism in her stride, which was a relief. Koike basically leaned  back and read her lines in a bored drawl, but as her part called for a  bored drawl for much of the early part of the play, that worked out  just fine. Momomi just wondered what she’d do when they reached the  madness scenes. Presumably Koike would actually have to expend some  energy at some point. Shion turned up at one point, providing them with  some further direction. After half an hour, an extremely nervous Hirai  stopped them. “Okay, now we’re changing the groups around a little…  Kiyashiki-san and Koike-san, go and work with Ohtori-san. Kenjou-san,  with Kanda-san, if you please. Tou-san and Uemura-san, please join  Nagasawa’s group. Is that fine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine,” Eida replied decisively, looking around at them with a glare that accepted no protest at all. “Get to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’ll see you guys later,” Momomi remarked, standing and sticking her script under her arm. “It’s been fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike  sighed, shaking her head. “The duties of a lead… I hope you enjoyed  that, Murai-san, because you won’t see her for a while. I get the best  of both worlds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, don’t be so gloomy,” Momomi replied. “I’m  sure you’ll get on just fine without me, anyway. And you have a tough  role, Koike-san. Don’t let madden you, it’d upset me if you came to  hate my script.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike chuckled. “Very droll… I’ll try my best. I  have my dignity, after all. Though your script-writing will strip it  from me, no doubt.” She smiled in an angular manner, standing herself.  “Well, if you can spare any time, I’d be interested to talk to the  Phareli child.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? You’ve never bothered before…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Phareli that attended the school before now wasn’t even worth knowing,” Koike replied bluntly. “Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s mean, Asayo-chan,” Murai complained. “You shouldn’t say things like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. It isn’t acceptable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s fine,” Momomi replied amicably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagasawa scowled. “But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, she’s right, after all.” Momomi waved briefly. “Later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you, Momo-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good luck.” Nagasawa sighed. “Under these conditions, you’ll need it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Later,” Koike said absently, following Momomi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed as she walked away. <em>Two  old-school land-owning aristocrats and one daughter of an obnoxiously  rich industrialist. Only at Astraea would you find such things…and now  I’m going to talk to the second cousin to a family of old-school  land-owning aristocrats turned corporate imperialists. This probably  does make sense, it just feels strange, that’s all. </em>She tapped her forehead thoughtfully. <em>The  Phareli child? It’s a long time since I’ve been called anything like  that… the downside of being noticed for the right reasons is that  people will remember everything else about you, as well. I doubt Koike  takes me seriously for that, though. No, I’m something amusing to her.  Well, she can think what she likes, really. It’s not important. I  wonder, when did I stop believing in concepts like that? The family  that’s so important to people to Koike. Probably with my father, I  suppose. The things he did in the name of the family aren’t anything  I’ll ever forgive him for. And it’s only natural I should detest the  same institution he’s dedicated his life to myself. Is that just a  normal child’s rebellion? </em>Momomi scowled. Koike was simply walking alongside her in silence. Albeit an amused silence, with a knowing kind of expression. <em>Though  my father also rebelled against the family by marrying Yukaho. I just  hope I don’t end up like him, however I look at it. Well, Luigia  shouldn’t die, so it won’t ever be an issue. But still, that’s another  strange thought, if I remember that even my orthodox father resisted…  and for what? That broken marriage? It doesn’t even make sense…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re looking very philosophical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-san…”  Momomi looked up, smiling. “Not really. I just met someone who made me  think about something, that’s all. Well, I shouldn’t say met, she’s in  our year, but it’s the first time I’ve really talked to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sat next to the blue-haired girl, placing her ruffled script on her  lap. “But there’s really a lot of people like us here, isn’t there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People like us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The upper class. To put it bluntly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…  that’s right.” Amane shrugged. “It’s something I’m aware of. My family  expects me to know everyone important that attends this school. That’s  irrelevant, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My mother put me through something similar.  She enjoyed it. It’s like… horse breeding, I guess.” Momomi giggled.  “Only the trading, haggling and breeding is between families and the  horses are young people. The things that will happen to us when we grow  up, if they have their way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true.” Amane sighed. “Humans  are harder to break and train, though.” She was silent for a moment.  “This is probably a good thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Probably, yes. Just as long as your parents don’t take to you with whips and spurs, that’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  two get on surprisingly well,” Koike observed, sitting down herself.  “But you do have common ground, of course. As strange as that is for me  to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Koike,” Amane observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, what’s your take on this?” Momomi asked politely. “As you say, we have common ground… as strange as that is for me to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh.”  Koike slumped backwards again, closing her eyes. “Well, I’ve got no  strong opinions. Father says I can marry a rabbit if I get off on that,  just so long as I can handle money.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Momomi sighed, shaking her head slightly. “That’s remarkably… causal…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  not the Phareli or the Ohtori, with sticks up our backsides about the  strangest things,” Koike smirked. “That also means I can be myself  without being a drop-out, which is nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Momomi asked quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. How is your mother?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike’s jaw twitched. “She’s fine, thank you for asking. And your sister, Ohtori-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  doing well,” Amane replied flatly. “I’ll be seeing her again at  Christmas, which will be very refreshing. We’re holding a ball. Do you  think your family will be able to attend? It will be quite the event,  of course…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll be having a quiet Christmas.” Koike glared.  “But you’re being pretty low. I should expect that from an Ohtori, I  suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I was just  asking an innocent question. Rather like your own comments were  innocent observations…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, shut up. I agree with Nagasawa, this is just tedious. And I don’t even know what you’re talking about!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  looks like you’re a little less informed than me,” Amane replied,  smiling. “That’s a good thing, though. My head hurts from everything  I’ve had to learn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike glared. “In any case, it is an  irrelevant conversation. We should get on with what we came here for.  God knows I didn’t turn up to chat to you two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Don’t you want to talk to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Talking  and chatting are completely different.” Koike turned the pages in her  script. “In any case, it’s getting boring. We should just get started  already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced between her and Amane, then shrugged and  looked down. “Right, just as I said before. We can start. The second  half of Act 1 scene 5, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane looked down. “We begin with your line, Koike-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. <em>Madam, yond young fellow</em>…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few minutes later, Shion arrived, looking down at them. “Well, how are you getting on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re good, thank you,” Momomi replied politely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’d have been better if you hadn’t interrupted us,” Koike added sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, you really remind me of Kaname,” Momomi observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, god. Don’t you dare compare me to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She has a point, actually,” Shion observed, putting a hand on her hip. “A very definite point. That sarcasm was very like her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure Kenjou has a monopoly on sarcasm, of course” Koike closed her eyes, sounding bored. “See what I did there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very droll,” Momomi imitated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  humour aside, is everyone okay with their parts?” Shion asked. “If  anyone has any problems, it’s best to say so now. That way we can make  any necessary changes early in the process.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s all fine to me,” Momomi replied. “But I suppose it would be, under the circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. It’s fine, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you really think so?” Koike asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Shion smiled. “Is there a problem, Koike-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  room for improvement.” Koike shrugged languidly. “Personally, I  disagree with the archaic language. That’s irrelevant, though. My  punning lines too literal. They should be rewritten to give the  meaning. If that’s true of the Fool’s lines as well, there’s a problem.  Aside from that, word choices here and there… I could write a list, if  you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you could do better, could you?” Momomi demanded, incensed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably,” Koike replied evenly. “But you’d have to pay me before I bothered to do something so dreary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll bear your advice in mind, Koike-san. Thank you. Was there anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not particularly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then that’s fine. Everyone getting on okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,” Amane replied evenly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just nodded stiffly, while Koike didn’t even bother to reply. <em>I’d  forgotten, of course. Along with nice, simple fangirls and decent  people like Amane-san, you’ll occasionally get the more troublesome  kind. People like me, really. </em>But she didn’t say as much out loud. That would be a victory to Koike, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion pulled up a chair and sat down. “And everything’s fine with the reading, too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Room for improvement,” Koike replied dryly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On her part, too,” Momomi noted. “But things are going pretty well, all in all. It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  nodded. “There haven’t been any significant problems. Though this is  the first time I’ve taken part in a play proper, so my performance may  not be as good as it should be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “Believe me, you won’t have a problem with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike snorted. “Quite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good. Can you show me, then?” Shion asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now?” Momomi shifted, blinking. “That’s very abrupt…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, right now. For preference.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s very abrupt.” Momomi sighed. “Fine. Koike-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. You don’t have to tell me, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sat through their performance, nodding slightly and smiling. She  clapped her hands once they’d finished. “That’s very good, actually.  I’ll probably have you perform that to the others after our break,  okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what?” Momomi demanded. “Now you tell us that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re not performing to many people, are we?” Koike asked. “If you can’t deal with this kind of audience…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  fine, obviously,” Momomi retorted. “I just like to be well-prepared,  after all. But considering I received this role, I’m good enough to be  worthy of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or you have useful friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a ridiculous allegation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion sighed. “Well, my advice was purely advisory, in point of fact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who said anything about you?” Koike asked, smiling maliciously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  no one. But I just thought I’d mention that the casting was the  exclusive decision of Eida-san,” Shion continued. “Who selected it  based on merit alone. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike snorted. “If you say so… it’s a convenient excuse, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glared at her, feeling her already dwindling patience fraying further.  “Aren’t you the one finding a convenient excuse here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shall we carry on?” Amane asked dully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  remaining practise time was spent in a distinctly negative ambience.  Momomi was glaring past Amane at a pointedly indifferent Koike as she  read her lines for the fifth time. <em>“Are you a comedian?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eida clapped her hands loudly, gaining their attention. “Fine, that’s enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The noise receded, everyone looking up at the stage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  you’ve worked hard, so we’ll have a break for ten minutes and then  twenty minutes for performances from the different groups…” Eida  glared. “For the break, we do intend this to be a partly social  activity, forging links across years.” She sounded like she had no such  intention. “So use this time to talk over various aspects of the play  and get to know each other. We’ll be available to talk to if need be.  That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike stood and walked off without a word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted, watching her go. “She has a bloody annoying attitude, doesn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged. “If you say so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you think so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not particularly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  scowled. “Well, I mean, she’s as prickly as hell, and she always finds  fault in everything, and she’s being deliberately antagonistic as well.  Why did she even come here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane closed her eyes. “Who knows? Does it matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It does if we’ll be working with her for weeks at the time!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Provided you both read your lines, that’s all you need to do.” Amane glanced at her. “Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you’re right, but there’s such a thing as atmosphere…” Momomi sighed.  “Besides, it sounded like she was annoying you earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She was saying unnecessary things, so I said an unnecessary thing. I wasn’t annoyed as such.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Well, you sounded annoyed to me. And you sound like you know her family quite well, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. I do. We’ve met several times before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smiled wanly. “This is what I was talking about in the first place,  though. Only in a school like this would you find so many people like  us…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hope I’m not interrupting anything,” Kaname remarked,  looking down at them. Her tone suggested that she was thinking anything  but that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” Momomi said, standing and smiling. “It’s good to see you. How are you getting on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  doing fine,” Kaname replied, sitting where Koike had been a few seconds  ago. “It’s going very well, thank you.” Her eyes narrowed slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane’s nonchalance became more calculated. “Kenjou…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohtori.” Kaname glared at her. “Are you doing well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” She leaned forwards slightly. “A little surprising, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For someone like you, who spends all your time playing around with horses, to be any good at this, is strange.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m surprised as well, but for you… considering you spent the last half-year in your room doing nothing in particular.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Considering  you barely know me, you’re not qualified to make that statement. I  always busied myself with various things. Most notably, revision for  the scholarship exams, of course...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sat between them, raising her hands. “In any case, I was just saying to  Amane-san that aristocrats are over-represented here. It creates a very  strange environment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For the most part, you’re all just as bad  as any other kind of people,” Kaname noted. “But the attitudes can be  especially annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think so?” Momomi asked, smiling weakly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Absolutely.  None of you take much very seriously and have too much free time,  busying yourself with trivial pastimes like this… that’s a result of  the demographic.” Kaname snorted. “But really, isn’t a large private  school like this way too archaic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surely you lost your right to criticise it for that when you chose to come here?” Amane asked. “That would be logical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  I can criticise Japan even though I live here. It’s an imperfect  system. But for my part, I’d have all entry selection-based.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that equally elitist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?” Kaname challenged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  closed her eyes for a moment. “Intelligence, not wealth, would become  predominant… but I suppose such a system wouldn’t do you any harm, of  course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So? It’s hypocritical for you to advocate this kind of segregation but not the other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  no hypocrisy, they’re completely different. And that’s how it should  be. For those who have the intelligence and the will to progress beyond  their birth, there should always be opportunities like this. It’s a lot  better than pretending that state-funded education can do everything.”  Kaname glared. “And a thousand times more logical than private school  education, which merely cements inequality rather than changing it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On  practical terms, this school requires its private status to function.  That much is obvious.” Amane shrugged. “But on purely theoretical  terms, too, you take a very simplistic view of the world. As I said  before, intelligence is another kind of inequality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s one  that can genuinely be overcome by hard work, in part,” Kaname retorted.  “But pushing on a closed door is useless in terms of social status. For  the rest, at least it’s a genuine natural difference.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  still selecting a very small group, seemingly at random, in order to  promote their interests over anyone else,” Amane replied. “It would  still facilitate the propagation of an elite, would it not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  what do you suggest?” Kaname asked. “Are we going to pretend that  everyone’s equal now? Don’t make me laugh… some people have more  potential than others do, and that’s a fact. Treating everyone as if  they are identical is a ludicrous way of doing things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  no need to treat everyone as equal. But still, schools should be as  diverse as possible. Economically, perhaps, but in intelligence as  well. With the elite segregated, it’s damaging for the other schools.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  They can concentrate on the people they need to deal with, and the most  intelligent get proper treatment elsewhere. It’s mutually beneficial.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  may have noticed, but a few intelligent students can make a huge  difference to a class. Take that core away and the learning experience  is probably diminished. Of course, that’s all theoretical on my part.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’ve seen it. It’s a waste of time, they all drag each other down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  does that make for a healthy school?” Amane folded her arms. “Here, at  least, there is a diversity of ability and the recognition of different  talents. You reduce everything to a simple concept and narrow the  ability band. It’s as unreflective of real society as this school is  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And is that a problem? Provided the economic backgrounds vary, there’s no point in worrying about anything else…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, Momo-chan, what are they talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi jumped, looking around quickly. “Oh, it’s you, Murai-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The first-year nodded. “They’re having quite a passionate argument. What is it about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  about nothing,” Momomi replied, speaking more loudly than was strictly  necessary. “I’ve no idea. No sooner had they sat down, but they’re  arguing about something…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you have to talk about me as if I’m not here?” Kaname demanded, finally breaking away from their debate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  certainly talking as if I’m not there,” Momomi snapped. “But that’s  fine, I lost interest in that conversation long ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s hardly our fault. It’s an important ideological debate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  just an excuse to go on and on, which is unusual for both of you.”  Momomi sighed. “Can’t we talk about the play or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  play?” Kaname asked. “That boring thing? Why can’t we talk about  interesting things? I’ve been looking at that damn script for an hour,  I don’t even want to think about it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not my fault you have  a short attention span.” Momomi sighed deeply. “Honestly, sometimes I  wonder how many people here turned up for the play itself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did,” Murai said enthusiastically. “It looked interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you here, anyway?” Kaname demanded, squinting at the younger girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  see my interesting senpais talking,” Murai replied. “I wonder whether  my friends will ever argue about such interesting things…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her smile looks a little too crafty to me. </em>“Well,  I wouldn’t call this interesting,” Momomi replied out loud. “It’s all  so much bilge, anyway. So, how about the people? Made any new friends,  Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “A little more specifically than just that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can work with these people. But it’s not like I want to spend time with them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should be more polite,” Momomi chided. “It’s very important, you know.  Starting tomorrow, I’m going to force you to socialise with the others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you with her for even longer?” Kaname demanded. She didn’t specify the her, because she didn’t need to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  have plenty of people to talk to, as well.” Momomi folded her arms,  catching Amane’s interested eyes. “That’s a conversation for later,  though. How about you, Ohtori-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I’ve renewed acquaintances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “And you, Murai-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,”  Kaname interjected. “Why did I have to go to more detail but you let  Amane get away with that? That doesn’t even make sense…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m used to her, it’s not important. In any case, Murai-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  met a lot of interesting people, such as all of you, Nagasawa-san and  Koike-san…” Murai smiled enthusiastically. “It’s been fun. I hope I get  to work with different people in future!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Great,” Kaname muttered, resting her head in her hands. “Insincere cuteness overload…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. Well, that’s good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a momentary silence. Kaname took that as a chance to resume her  staring contest with Amane. For once, the other girl appeared to be  paying attention. <em>That’s strange. And in the debate earlier, as  well, she took part. Normally she’d just completely ignore this kind of  thing. Of course, that’s all the more reason to find a way to shut them  both up…</em>Momomi cast around for a topic of conversation, smiling  weakly. “Uhm, Koike-san critiqued my script in some aspects. Do you  agree that I was too literal in the translation of the puns and word  games?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “It’s fit for purpose. That’s all it needs to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t  that a lazy attitude, though?” Kaname pointed out. “We’re supposed to  be doing something amazing here, not merely decent enough to rub by.  That’s why I’m here anyway. You might not be as ambitious, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane raised an eyebrow. “You think a lot of a mere lower-school play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever we do, it might as well be good.” Kaname snorted. “That should be obvious. What’s the point in doing anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. <em>Here we go again. </em>“That’s all very interesting, but that doesn’t answer the question. What do you think, Murai-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Murai shrugged. “I don’t know, really. I don’t know what you’re talking about. I only just got the script, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, right… I’d forgotten.” Momomi frowned. <em>So how about Koike, then? That’s slightly odd.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can talk to Eida-san later about it. I’m sure she’ll have ideas.” Amane  leaned back, but kept her eyes open, locked on Kaname.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  right, I suppose.” Momomi’s gaze swept the room, finding the person she  was looking for. To her surprise, Koike was alone, reading through the  script. <em>I had her marked as the popular type. Perhaps her friends are simply elsewhere, but if that’s the case, why did she come? </em>“Say,” she began, cutting off the other two.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” Kaname asked. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That girl, Asayo Koike. What do you all know about her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shrugged. “In my class. A friend of Yuho’s, I think. At least they talk  to each other a lot. A lazy smart-arse in lessons. Makes sarcastic  comments. Very good at English.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think of her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Who knows?” Her eyes narrowed, and she glanced sharply at Momomi. “Has she been bothering me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, not really,” Momomi lied. “I was just curious, when she was alone there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then are you planning to add her to your social club?” Kaname demanded. She didn’t look like she was particularly fooled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you call it that, that’s what having friends is. But I don’t have a  lot of time, no does Koike-san like me or need me. So it’s fine.”  Momomi folded her arms. “Sometimes my innocent questions really are  innocent, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a good point, though,” Murai noted. “I’ll go and talk to Koike-san. Good afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted, watching her walk away. “What an obnoxiously good girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Momomi wondered, looking unconvinced.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shouldn’t you stop her?” Amane asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Koike won’t be pleased.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s not my business,” Momomi retorted happily. “It’s got nothing to do with me, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, break’s over!” Eida snapped. “Gather round!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only twenty minutes left,” Kaname muttered, standing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Oh, yeah…” Momomi frowned, rubbing her eyes briefly. <em>So many new people means this has been more tiring than I could have anticipated. The script writing was easier. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not polite to say that out loud.” Amane walked towards the stage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really? Do you think I care?” Kaname followed her irritably. “I was  telling the bloody time. No trauma inducing phrases there, though I  could use a few…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a matter of good manners.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And these two in the same room is getting worse than ever before. Just my luck…</em></span></p>
