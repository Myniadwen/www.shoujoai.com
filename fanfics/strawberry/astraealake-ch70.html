<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Very sorry  I'm late. I bring you Chikaru by way of apology, but don't get used to  her. I know that if she stays here too long, she'll turn into a dark  and manipulative character. The rot's already setting in. I mean, isn't  she just too nice to everyone to be true?</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So we’re here again, are we?” Momomi observed, smiling awkwardly. “As ever, Eida-san is something of a perfectionist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s a lot to improve on. Don’t have any misapprehensions about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Does that go for you, Koike-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course.” Koike snorted. “This is an art-form that takes effort and  time. Even for you two, it’s impossible to simply turn up with the  lines half-learned and fake it. People like me can tell the difference,  undoubtedly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your tastes haven’t changed,” Amane observed quietly. “I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. You shouldn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced between them, then shrugged. “Well, I take your point. But you  don’t have to take me so seriously, either. It was a casual complaint.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a waste of breath, in short. That’s reason enough to shut you up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I’m sure you yourself never say anything unnecessary, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane scowled. “This conversation, too, is unnecessary, is it not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.  I suppose so. But unlike pointless whining, this serves a purpose.”  Koike glanced at her innocently. “It’s important that Phareli-san knows  how I feel about this, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can assure you, that is unnecessary as well.” Momomi smiled pleasantly. “Shall we just get on with it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you like,” Koike replied, leaning back in her seat. “It’s all the same to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then, Koike-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. You two don’t have to tell me any time.” Koike closed her eyes.  “I’m taking a moment to get into character, thank you. I appreciate you  two don’t have that integrity, but some of us actually try to act.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Getting  into character?” Momomi scoffed. “Aren’t you the natural Malvolio? Just  read the lines as yourself, and it’ll be the best performance of that  role I’ll have ever seen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wasn’t necessary, especially from someone who ostensibly wants to get on with things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, your sarcasm wasn’t necessary either!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  your instruction was?” Koike queried. “Only it wasn’t, of course,  that’s the whole point. Besides, comparing me to Malvolio was fairly  low. For a start, I’d rather commit seppuku than run around crushing on  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That suits me just fine. My reaction, if nothing else, would match Olivia’s quite nicely…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is the final word that important?” Amane rubbed the bridge of her nose irritably. “It’s very tiring of you both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Well,  however I look at it, my relationship with these two is pretty strained  in these moments. I’m just glad, so glad, that we’re only together in a  few scenes. Anything else would just be unfortunate. </em>Momomi looked up briefly as Koike began, vaguely annoyed by her skill and intensity. <em>It’s  like she has no redeeming features, except perhaps her dramatics. She’s  loud, stubborn, cunning, manipulative, careless, antisocial,  obstructionistic and thoroughly impolite. She’s also irritatingly  knowing, pretty openly dislikes me and likes being mysterious and  annoying. I barely know her, but I can’t help but be irritated to heck  by her. She’s just damnably, unbelievably obnoxious, it’s almost more  than I can bear…</em>Momomi sighed quietly. <em>In others words, she’s  not unlike me, I suppose. The face I show to the world at large, in any  case. I’m pretty sure I’m not as annoying or lazy, though. But that’s  not important. I’m still stuck with her. And if she really is someone  like me, someone who is truly a manipulator rather than someone who  pretends to that personality, it will be very troublesome. Quite apart  from anything else, she was gathering intelligence on me before I  remembered she existed. And if it comes to it, that gives her quite the  advantage. I’m barely getting a feel for who she is, but I’m sure she  knows everything about me. That’s another disadvantage of becoming  known, I suppose. I should tell it to Kaname, just to be fair. What  does she want, though? That’s the most important question. Is she just  someone with a cool, disinterested attitude who is too proud to get on  with someone like me? Or does she actually have some reason to trouble  me? Either way, she isn’t telling…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi, Phareli! What did I  just say? Focus and put some effort in, already. I dislike it when you  insult an enterprise through being so damn lazy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that my line?” Momomi retorted. “There doesn’t appear to be a lot that you take seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unlike you, I know when it’s time to make a token effort. That’s more than you’ve done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m very sorry I’m not meeting your high standards.” Momomi looked down  at her script again, biting her lip. “And it’s Kiyashiki. Not Phareli.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The disowned child who disowns her family… so which came first? The chicken or the egg?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough, Koike.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  That’s enough, is it?” Koike asked, smiling unpleasantly. “That’s  interesting. But as she’s not doing any work in the first instance, I  might as well satisfy my curiosity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too bad. I won’t tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Either  way, I find it hilarious that you so openly run from your family,”  Koike noted. “That’s a classic kind of distancing device, isn’t it?  Suppressing the past may work wonderfully for you, but it’s lazy in the  extreme. And it won’t fix anything either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s there to be fixed? I don’t like my family, that’s all. People like me do exist, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  it’s effective enough. But it doesn’t befit the fearless, defiant girl  you’re made out to be. Reclaiming your past is more effective than  running away from it.” Koike chuckled. “Of course, I’m no rebel, so  this little speculation of mine is merely theoretical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mainly  theoretical, and far too over-complicated,” Momomi noted. “I’d rather  be associated with my mother than my father. That’s all there is to it,  there’s no dramatic statement there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? How boring.” Koike  shrugged. “In any case, Phareli, can’t you just start again? And show a  little passion this time around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you say I do unnecessary things…” Momomi looked down at her script, sighing again. “<em>Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face…</em>” <em>And  Amane, of course, is no help at all. I’m sure they know each other. For  once, Amane knows something about someone, even if it’s only  superficial. But she’s just sitting here, being annoyed by both of us  without taking a side or really protesting. That’s her sort of  response. She can be very frustrating at times, especially when other  people are around. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still no good,” Koike complained. “I’ve  no idea how you got this part, you know. I wouldn’t say you’re good  enough for it. But I suppose it’s what I said before, knowing a certain  senpai is useful…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough,” Amane said. “The audition was fair, whatever you make of that. She got her part and you got yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike  snorted, shrugging languorously. “Of course. This has nothing to do  with my abilities, and me though. She’s just not good enough, that’s  all. Isn’t it frustrating, Ohtori-san? You’re definitely going to be  held back by someone like her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s impossible, considering my own lack of experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you’re just the natural genius, aren’t you?” Koike pointed out. “Of  course your schooling in oratory probably helped, but really it comes  down to that. I must admit, that’s rather obnoxious of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t  you the obnoxious one here?” Momomi demanded irritably. “For someone  who complains about people who say unnecessary things, you sure take  your time insulting others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? Perhaps. Well, it depends on  your perspective. If it’s merely a matter of results, naturally we  should just practise.” Koike glanced at her, eyes bored. “But it’s  moderately interesting to argue with you both like this, don’t you  think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You missed your calling,” Amane said. “You should have joined the debating society.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  aren’t you missing your calling right now?” Koike sighed, shaking her  head in feigned regret. “It’s very strange, isn’t it? Now, of all  times, you decide to take an interest in a play. Unlike before, when-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was a whim. There’s no deeper meaning to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I can’t say it’s because of someone you wanted meet again, then?” Koike  asked playfully. “That’s too bad. Perhaps it’s someone who you’ve only  recently met motivating you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said, it was a whim. Don’t overanalyse that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you say so, Ohtori-san. But you’re hardly a whimsical person, now are  you? On the contrary, you’re trained to consider your every word and  action…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi slapped her leg with her script, scowling. “Oh, come on. Are we practising this or not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if I was taught to be perfect, I can still have whims. Don’t mistake that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I, of all people, should know that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop ignoring me!” Momomi glared at them both. “Whatever cute argument you can have, it can keep. I’m bored already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you want to, all of a sudden?” Koike asked. “I will if you’re willing.  But listening to you half-read your lines isn’t interesting enough to  keep me awake, so I do this instead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gritted her teeth,  incensed. “As if you’re any better, so one more time.” This time she  actually concentrated, attempting a somewhat sarcastic passion into her  words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To her surprise, Koike leaned back and closed her eyes  again without saying a word. Amane took up her lines and they ran  through the rest of the scene.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well?” Momomi demanded. “How was that? Have I met your agonisingly high standards?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  was acceptable. You still have a way to go, but at least you were  trying for once. Ohtori-san was better, but that’s to be expected of  the <em>genius.</em>” Her inflection was derisive, not praising.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just blinked impassively. “Then why don’t you begin again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will.” Koike opened her eyes and turned to the appropriate page, beginning to read again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed slightly. <em>I’m  not sure how to deal with her, which is undoubtedly her intention.  Going to the third-years and complaining is just far too weak and  pathetic. For similar reasons, I don’t want to go to Shion. She’d only  take it as a favour and make me do something else for her. Amane’s no  good either, thanks to her general indifference. But it’s not like I’m  going to let this girl say and do everything she likes, either. I’m not  that kind. I can’t repeat the phone trick, because she doesn’t have  anything incriminating to say…well, she’s a complete mystery. I don’t  even know what she wants. Under those circumstances, it’s natural that  she can get away with this. She comes across as so confident as to be  perfect; but that’s a façade, I know that, because I do something  similar. I just need to discover her weaknesses and-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, how was that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,” Momomi replied absently. “I’m sure it was very good, a lot better than anything I could do, naturally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on.” Koike looked at her with extremely irritated with eyes. “You  have a horribly short attention span. Sarcasm doesn’t help, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  much attention am I supposed to pay? It’s not even my lines! You do  your thing and it sounds fine to me. Or are you just picking a fight  for the sake of picking a fight, or what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wrong. How am I  supposed to improve when you’re like that?” Koike leaned forwards  irritably. “God, it pisses me off. Why did you even go for this? It’s  not like you pay attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mostly because you keep distracting  me. Besides, how much attention do you pay?” Momomi gave her a hostile  stare. “When you’ve done your part, you just lean back and stop  listening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m listening, idiot. I even close my eyes, because your voice is all that matters right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you are listening, you sure aren’t constructive about it. What advice  did you have to give me? I have a long way to go? That’s hardly  helpful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you were pressing me, the most general observation  would be like you’re anyone else reading Shakespeare,” Koike retorted.  “You’re too conscious of the archaic language, and too melodramatic,  with an unnecessary flair. Be more subdued, already, and less like the  umpteenth actor who thinks that reading Shakespeare automatically makes  them an artist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, you see, that’s actually helpful. Even if  you say you want to improve, though, you didn’t tell me that unto just  now. That’s no better attitude than mine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. I didn’t know  whether someone as delicate and noisy as you could take any kind of  criticism. I don’t want you to cry on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can take  constructive criticism, thank you very much. Pointless insults also  bounce straight off, so you can use whatever you have. It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I will, and so I won’t let you slack off any more. We’ll see if you come to regret what you wished for as time passes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if you have anything you could say to bother me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike  snorted. “You’re very proud. As if that’s a surprise. But for your  part, you’re even worse. Did you actually pay enough attention to give  me any constructive criticism?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. I didn’t think it  was necessary, considering the fact that you aren’t taking this  seriously at all.” Momomi folded her arms. “Insulting us both and  arguing all the time is pointless. I’m not going to expend energy  worrying about someone with that attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? But you’d like  my advice? That’s pretty hypocritical.” Koike scowled. “If it’s  something like that, I won’t expend effort on someone who isn’t  providing any effort themselves, either. If this is how you’re treating  it, there’s no point in me even bothering to turn up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  it’s obvious, isn’t it?” Amane glanced between them, crimson eyes  impassive. “Kiyashiki-san can pay attention and Koike-san can stop  insulting us. That’s all, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you still swoop into a  conversation as it pleases you, and dictates on something that has  nothing to do with you,” Koike observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course it’s to do  with me. I’m a part of this play.” Amane shrugged. “Though this is me.  It doesn’t really matter to me whether we go or stay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “Well, that’s nice to know. Now we’re all indifferent…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“However, it probably matters to Koike-san. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. Who’d be interested in a crappy junior production like this  anyway?” Koike folded her arms. “I have nothing to do with the time,  that’s all. Though anything would be better than this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you’re here. So why not make it good?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sure like to oversimplify things, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  still overcomplicate things, Koike.” Amane glanced at Momomi. “But this  is something that matters to someone like her. She takes it seriously,  so you shouldn’t be offended if she wants you to do the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you talking about?” Koike demanded huffily, looking away. “I told  you, this doesn’t interest me at all. It’s just boring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If it’s  so important to her, then what’s the point in being so  confrontational?” Momomi asked, giving Amane an annoyed look. “That’s a  very convenient excuse, but I don’t see it all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She doesn’t like either me or you. So it’s natural. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Disliking  you is a strong concept. I’d rather say that you are both very  irritating.” Koike glared. “Something you’ll both no doubt say of me,  so I’m sure you can understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I don’t dislike you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If it’s you, Ohtori-san, I could kill your mother and you probably wouldn’t bother to dislike me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  an irrelevant example, irrespective of factuality. You’re dodging the  point.” Amane crossed her arms, leaning back comfortably in her chair.  “We all want this play to be a success, don’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a very convenient truth.” Koike snorted irritably. “It doesn’t mean we like each other, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?  How about it?” Momomi inquired icily. “If you take this so seriously,  and are so bothered by my indifference, isn’t it obvious that you  should agree with her? I’m the one who’s allowed to be indifferent.  Otherwise you’d just me a hypocrite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch.” Koike gave her an unpleasant look. “Fine. This is what I wanted in the first place, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Koike-san…” Amane began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got it. You don’t have to say it again.” Koike picked up her script, and started to read again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my. Are we all friends now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced up at Shion. “Hardly.” Then her gaze shifted sideways, to a black-haired girl standing next to her. “Who is she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  Kiyashiki-san, that’s very rude of you,” Shion chided. She turned to  the other girl. “This is Kiyashiki-san, one of my acquaintances in the  second year, Koike-san from the same year, and of course Ohtori-san.  They play Olivia, Malvolio and Viola respectively.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  black-haired girl nodded politely. “It’s a pleasure to meet you all.  I’m Chikaru Minamoto, helping Shion-san with a few things. So I’m  afraid you may see my around from time to time.” She cocked her head,  smiling. “So let’s get on well, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed, rubbing the back of her forehead. “I see. Nice to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  murmured something inaudible while Koike grunted. “Tch. The moment we  actually get down to some serious work you interrupt us with something  superfluous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there’s only a few minutes left. You spent  most of that time arguing.” Shion shook her head. “That was very  disappointing. Eida-san wanted your blood, and if you’d gone on another  two minutes she’d have shouted at you at some expense to my pride.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, whatever. The situation’s resolved, isn’t it?” Koike asked. “Your pride has nothing to do with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I wouldn’t go that far. That said, I’m not sure why you are here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“These three are what you might call problem children,” Shion explained. “They’re talented, but have difficult personalities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oi!” Koike snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t talk about us as if we aren’t there!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re  just spirited, aren’t they?” Chikaru said innocently. “I’m sure you  wouldn’t like to be teaching anyone who wasn’t like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion looked down, smirking. “Well, that’s true enough, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  it would be, as if you ever taught us anything at all.” Momomi looked  up at them again. “So, why are you here talking, anyway? Just to  disrupt our flow?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t embarrass your senpai, Kiyashiki-san.” Shion chuckled. “Or I will tell Chikaru all your dirty secrets.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“However  she dragged you here, run away now!” Momomi instructed. “She’s the  stalker senpai who assembles computer files on students and trapped me  into taking part in this damned play! I can take it, but there’s no  point in someone from Lulim getting involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that true?” Chikaru smiled. “My, what an interesting hobby. Files, you say? Do you include body measurements in that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, actually. Even for me, that data would be… difficult to obtain. In a proper manner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s easier than you’d think, actually. I’ll show you later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be much appreciated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi buried her head in her hands. <em>Oh, great. This one’s even crazier than Shion. Just my luck.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  Shion-san’s told me quite a bit about you all,” Chikaru said. “I was  very interested, so it’s a pleasure to meet you in person. As I  thought, Spica has interesting students.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if you ask me,” Momomi said, “Lulim is far more <em>interesting</em>…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, thank you. But we’re fairly ordinary girls, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>By what kind of standard is that judged? Wealth, I could accept. Sanity somewhat less. </em>Momomi  looked around. Amane had her eyes closed and was probably asleep,  dreaming of horses, while Koike had also retreated into her shell. If  she was going to talk, it’d be on her own. Alternately, she could take  a similar stance and wait for Shion to go away…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Chikaru-san will  be helping us substantially with the costume design and making, as well  as other backstage work, so we’re indebted to her.” Shion put a hand on  her hip, looking down assertively. “She’s also a talented actress, so  we’ll be sure to take her advice whenever she can spare the time. I  hope you’ll be good and not give her any trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, I feel a  little flattered… I’m afraid I’m not so special as all that. I just  thought I’d help a little, and I only dabble in drama in any case.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, false modesty gets kind of boring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san, that’s rude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glared. “Well, I’m not someone who you can order around, you know. Who are you to tell me to be good?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can understand Kiyashiki-san’s attitude, so-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”  Shion raised a finger, shaking it gently. “I do like them to say what  they please, but there are limits. In Kiyashiki-san’s case, though, I  suppose she has some reason to be so arrogant. I’ll have to excuse my  kohai’s rudeness with something of an explanation…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you blackmailing me again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  at all. Nothing in your recent past merits blackmail, after all, now  does it, Kiyashiki-san? You’re a good girl, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. That doesn’t mean you wouldn’t misrepresent me.” Momomi looked  up hopefully at the Lulim girl. Sadly, she was looking between the two  of them with a casual spectator’s interest rather than any concern. <em>Damn detached girl…can’t she say something? This would be a good time for her to stop liking Shion.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perish  the thought, Kiyashiki-san. As ever, you are very uncharitable.” Shion  raised her fingers and waved briefly. “In any case, I’d better get on  with seeing the other groups. But as writer, you’ll be seeing  Chikaru-san more than most. So try to be more courteous in future.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  isn’t a problem. My tone may have been too humble, after all.” Chikaru  smiled at Momomi. “Well, I’ll look forwards to our next meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi knew when to lose with grace. “Of course. I have a few ideas for costuming myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chikaru  nodded, her gaze drifting sideways. “But I was surprised when I heard  from Shion-san, Ohtori-san. You don’t normally take part in activities  such as this one, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane glanced at her warily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s a very good actress, if not the most eloquent conversationalist,” Shion observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see. I’m glad. It’s good to have several interests, I think, and a lot  of people will be enthusiastic about Ohtori-san acting in a play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  quite convenient, actually,” Momomi remarked. “Her talents aside, the  similarity of appearance between her and Kaname is very noticeable,  don’t you think? That’ll make your job easier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s probably  true,” Chikaru agreed. “I’ve heard a lot about Kenjou-san, as well…”  She smiled knowingly, making Momomi blush despite herself. “She also  sounds like an interesting person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then we shall go and talk to her,” Shion said deftly, walking Chikaru away. “Work hard, you three.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, now I feel stupid about criticising your work ethic.” Koike snorted quietly. “Your senpai is even worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well, that’s how she does things. You know what gets me, though? I’ve  known her for a few weeks now, and I’m ‘Kiyashiki-san’. So why the hell  is this girl Shion was being sarcastic and distant about <em>this morning </em>has reached first name terms?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because she’s more likeable than you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  agreeing with everyone, yeah. Personally, I find her creepy.” Momomi  sighed. “But Shion’s easy to please. Anyone who takes an interest in  what she does and listens to her for long enough is someone she likes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like people everywhere. Isn’t that right, Ohtori-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  someone from Lulim? It’s a strange thing to me, considering this is  supposed to be the Spica play.” Momomi shrugged. “If it means less work  for us, all the better, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does that have to do with anything? Slacking off again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  just making polite conversation. Though I appreciate that’s a foreign  concept to someone like you, who only deals in rudeness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can be perfectly polite, but I see no reason in being so with you,” Koike noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then remind me, what exactly did I do to you to annoy you so much?” Momomi asked. “If I know what it is, I can do it again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Wouldn’t you like to know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it that again?” Amane asked quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  wish. It’s just her attitude that annoys me. Phareli-san rebels in a  fashionable way while retaining the same sense of entitlement that she  had before… this play has been a good example of that. Of course, the  nepotism of this school lets her get away with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do go  on about the same things, don’t you?” Momomi complained. “While, I  completely dislike your hostile attitude, so it’s fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed. “You’re being very tiring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked up and prepared a sarcastic reply before another of Hirai’s stammered announcements interrupted her. <em>Honestly,  what is the sense in having the shy girl read everything out? It makes  me wonder what Eida and Shion are here for. Perhaps this is their idea  of improvement for the poor girl’s character…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uhm…  Ohtori-san and Koike-san will be working together on Act 2 Scene 2…  Kiyashiki-san with Uemura-san and Nagasawa-san… Nagai-san and  Kenjou-san on Act 3 Scene 3…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stood, brushing herself off. “Well, I’ll see you two later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just nodded briefly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch.” Koike sighed. “I’m getting tired of this bloody carousel… well, enjoy yourself, or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye.” Momomi turned and walked away, snorting irritably. <em>Still  really annoying. Well, I’m sure Amane can enjoy her company. But when  do I get to the good scenes with Kaname, already? That’s the good thing  about having her play Sebastian, she wins in the end. Though that’s not  apparently enough for her…oh, well. She doesn’t look like she’s doing  too badly, either.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good evening, Kiyashiki-san,” Nagasawa said pleasantly, smiling at her. “Are you well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m good, thank you,” Momomi replied automatically. “And you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. This is Uemura Junna, a first year.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pleased to meet you,” Momomi said. “I’m Momomi Kiyashiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Uemura smiled. “Hi. Shion-senpai talks a lot about you, actually… I was very impressed by your acting before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, she does, does she?” <em>So  she makes up for playing informant to us by selling information about  us to others. Or is she talking about us as one would a pet project?  Either way, I’m beginning to take Koike’s point…is any first year here  free of her pervasive taint? </em>“Good things, I hope.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yep. She says you’re smart and beautiful, but stubborn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Really?” Momomi asked pleasantly. <em>I  guess this one half of Shion’s secret. If you know a lot of people who  talk to you, even on a superficial level, it’s much to your advantage.  I’m in difficulty now because I don’t know Koike, for example. But if I  knew a lot of people… </em>“Well, she talks about you all as well. She’s an interesting person, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  the break finally came, Momomi decided to remain where she was,  chatting to Uemura and Nagasawa. The conversation was shallow, but it  was something. <em>And if a certain someone wants influence, there are  worse ways to do it than to emulate Shion. She doesn’t have much in the  way of friends, but she has so many acquaintances. I wonder, though,  what would she have done if Isae was still here? </em>Momomi shrugged to herself. <em>Oh, well. It’s a moot point.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yo,” Kaname muttered, sitting down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, it’s the other one!” Uemura said enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname raised her eyebrows. “The other one? What the hell do you mean, the other one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She means the other one in relation to me, not Amane,” Momomi said hastily. “So it’s nothing to get upset about, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who said anything about Amane?” Kaname muttered. “I’m not second to you either, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t mean that, just that Shion-senpai always talks about you  together,” Uemura explained breathlessly. “She says you are the  talented, handsome but unbalanced one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am not unbalanced! Trust her to say what she likes with no regards for the facts…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, now, Kaname,” Momomi chided. “Don’t take it so seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not. It’s still annoying, though.” Kaname folded her arms. “How have you been getting on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll been doing really well,” Uemura replied happily. “Shion-senpai even said so earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Nagasawa agreed. “How about you, Kenjou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It went alright. I have the most mind-numbingly dull part ever, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just wait until your scenes with me,” Momomi noted. “Then things pick up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  should think so,” Kaname agreed. “Though I still have half a fear about  a last minute change of script. However I look at it, I’m playing the  guy, and this school prefers the alternative ending.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t  think that’s in danger. As long as I have strength, anyway.” Momomi  smiled. “This is what Shakespeare wrote. Everything else is for  fanfiction, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fanfiction? Of Shakespeare? Do people write that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. Probably.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, thanks for letting me know.” Kaname rubbed her eyes. “Now my mind is traumatised by the thought of slash boys lo-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi kicked her on the shin in a friendly fashion. Uemura looked between them, blinking innocently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname coughed slightly. “In any case, the great Ohtori-sama isn’t gracing us with her presence for once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Apparently not. I hadn’t really noticed.” Momomi looked around distractedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s no surprise. Her contribution to any conversation is generally  her superior silence, so there’s no reason for you to miss her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think I saw her leaving the room with Koike-san,” Nagasawa noted. “I’m sure they’ll be back shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With her?” Momomi asked sceptically. “They really didn’t seem to get on at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagasawa shrugged. “Perhaps that’s what they are talking about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever.  It doesn’t matter,” Kaname said shortly. She folded her arms, scowling  deeply. “Who cares whether those two are coming or going, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine,” Momomi agreed. “I’ll ask Amane-san about it tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No point. Forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Well, I have to talk to her about something, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  still don’t know why you have to talk to her about anything, actually…”  Kaname shook her head. “Or Koike, for that matter. I know what you are  like. You want to learn more about her, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mostly so I can use that information against her,” Momomi replied. “What does that have to do with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t bother. She isn’t worth the effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Nagasawa coughed. “This discussion can wait for another time, can’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you really think that?” Momomi asked, looking at Kaname’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blue-haired girl looked away, scowling at the floor. “Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, now you have me curious.”</span></p>
