<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Filler: Shinobu : Onee-sama<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  been almost two weeks since I’ve heard Yaya-onee-sama’s voice. I  heard the choir members say that she hasn’t been attending practice  for over a week now. I’m worried about her, but it really isn’t  my place to go and ask her about it. I’m nobody to her. So all I  can do is ask someone who might know.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was walking around the halls when I spotted Tsubomi-san, walking  towards my direction. I waved at her while calling her name.  “Tsubomi-san!” I could ask Tsubomi-san, she’s a classmate of  mine and she is part of the saintly chorus with Yaya-onee-sama.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looks at me and waves, she was in a wonderful pink dress with  red ribbons that complemented her hair. “Hi! Shinobu-san, What can  I do for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  blushed for a moment, nervous to ask my question. But strengthening my  resolve I asked away. “Is it true that Yaya-sempai has lost her  voice?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tsubomi  suddenly froze and blushed quite brightly. I instinctively swallowed  nervous of what that reaction of hers had meant. <em>‘I  does Tsubomi-san like Yaya-onee-sama?’</em> I continued to watch Tsubomi-san, she seemed out of it for the  moment. I wonder if something was wrong with Yaya-sempai that  Tsubomi-san can’t say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…  Um… Yeah!” She suddenly and nervously began saying. “She says  the doctor said that it may take a while for her to get her voice  back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What?!  Oh my… Poor Yaya-onee-sama…’</em> I thought sadly. Yaya-onee-sama was so nice and cool why did  something like this have to happen to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see… That’s too bad…” Was all I could say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hahaha…  Yeah it is. Maybe it is Kami-sama's way of saying if she doesn’t want to  use her beautiful voice he’ll give it to someone else who wants to  use it.” She laughed hard at that. I thought it was mean of her.  I’m told that Tsubomi-san and Yaya-onee-sama don’t get along too  well. I wonder why that is so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  was a little mean, Tsubomi-san.” I told her meekly. I didn’t  intend to speak it out… but it suddenly slipped out of my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… Yeah…  I guess so…” her laugh and smile disappeared almost instantly. I  decided to apologize.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry Tsubomi-san! I didn’t mean it like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled and looked out the window. “I know… But it was mean of  me…” so she said… which was something I didn’t expect to come  from her, at least if it was something that had to do with  Yaya-onee-sama. I found myself wondering about Tsubomi-san as well.  She wasn’t this quiet before. Something seemed off… I wonder if  something had happened between them and Yaya-onee-sama.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  see you later Shinobu-san. I want to have a shower and change of  clothes.” I nodded as she continued her walk towards her room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  soon found my thoughts back to Yaya-onee-sama. Tsubomi-san had just  confirmed that she had in fact lost her voice somehow and from what  she says it may be a while before we could hear Yaya-onee-sama’s  voice again. I wonder how she’s taking it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself roaming around the dorm house for a while and ended up  at the main entrance where I saw a security guard and a delivery man  had just exited the Sister in charge’s office. They then bowed and  exited the building. The sister spotted me and called me closer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes  can I help you Sister?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled as she looked at me before telling me her request. “Would  you go to room 212 and tell Nanto Yaya that there is a Package  waiting here in my office.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Room  212?! Yaya-onee-sama’s!?’</em> I was startled at first surprised to hear that the sister was asking  me to go and deliver a message to my idol… this is almost a dream  come true. I had to pinch myself to snap me awake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Ouch!’</em> wait… <em>‘that hurt!...  I’m not dreaming!’</em> this is my chance to talk to Yaya-onee-sama!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maehara-san?  Maehara-san?!” I realized that my thoughts had dazed me for a  moment seemingly causing the sister alarm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry… I got lost in thought.” I bowed and apologized to the her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  sighed, most likely disappointed at me. It was very rude to space out  in a conversation. “That’s all right. Please call her right  away.” She said as she turned toward her office once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  suddenly I thought that maybe I could bring her package up to  Yaya-onee-sama instead. “Excuse me?” I called to ask her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”  she paused and turned her head to look at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t  I just bring the package to her?” I asked twiddling my thumbs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  could… but…” She paused and opened the door to her office.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>but  what?’</em> I turned and  looked into her office. And was surprised that what greeted us were a  few big boxes that all had the ‘FRAGILE’ marked in big, bold, red  letters all over. I swallowed nervously and realized why sister only  asked me to call for Yaya-onee-sama. I’m quite clumsy with heavy  things… auw…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  go tell her then.” Was all I could say. I felt embarrassed that the  sister knew that I am clumsy and cannot be responsible for something  fragile. She just smiled sadly and patted my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  turned and headed upstairs where Yaya-onee-sama’s room is.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“208…  210… 212!” <em>‘I’m  here.’</em> I thought as I  tried to calm myself. I’ll finally get to see Yaya-onee-sama up  close. ‘I hope she’s here. I hope she’s here. I hope she’s  here.’ I prayed deep inside. I took a deep breath before I knocked  on the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was only silence for a few moments after the knock, I raised my hand  to knock again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  I’m coming.” Said a voice from the inside, it did not sound like  Yaya-onee-sama. I had assumed the worst when I heard it. <em>‘Oh  my Yaya-onee-sama has someone already. And they’re sharing the room  already!’</em> It took me a  few seconds to remember that Yaya-onee-sama was sharing a doubles  room with...</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door opened and I am faced with Konohana Hikari, Yaya-onee-sama’s  roommate and best friend. “Good Evening Sempai. This is  Nanto-Onee-… Nanto-sempai’s room am I correct?” I swear her eye  brow twitched when I almost said Onee-sama.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then nodded and said; “Yes it is.” I don’t know why but I feel  that Konohana-sempai looked annoyed for some reason. I’m told that  she’s really nice. But I think I’m going to trust my instinct  about her for now. And it was telling me to get my business done and  leave… Quickly! “A package was delivered for her just now. Sister  Mamasaka asked me to call her to pick it up in her office.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  nodded and opened the door wider revealing… Yaya-onee-sama, in a  very skimpy red tank top and tight blue jean shorts. I couldn’t  help but blush and force my self to swallow even though my mouth was  incredibly dry from being so nervous. I was completely stunned to see  so much of Yaya-onee-sama's divine figure. She looked and headed my way  after writing  something in her notebook.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  panicked… “Th-that wi-wii-will beeeeall. Th-th-thank  youforyourtime.” I quickly and badly said as I bowed and turned  away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>OW!”</strong> for a moment my head was struck with pain. I found myself on my knees  holding the left side of my head, where I realized I hit the door  frame with.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“auw…oh…auow….”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  soon realized that Yaya-onee-sama was in front of me, smiling. She  gently held my chin which made me yelp in surprise. But her hand  stayed where it was. With her other hand she took hold the hand that  was holding that side of my head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Onee-sama?”  I said without thinking. But then I found myself not minding it, when  I saw her smile widen. She gently lifted my hand away and gently ran  her hand thru my hair lifting it ever so carefully to check on the  possible wound on my head. Her hands let go and I could see her smile  soften a bit. She picked up her note book and began to write  something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>“<em>There  isn’t any cut. You should get some ice for that before it gets  swollen.”</em></u> Was what  she said. <em>'I guess it was true that she had lost her voice.'</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-y-yes…  I wi-will… Th-thank you.” I couldn’t help but stutter and  blush. I was so nervous and yet so happy at the same time. <em>‘Yaya-onee-sama touched  me. She touched me!!!’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a short while, I felt a little calmer now. Or at least enough not to  hit my head on the door frame again. I turned to leave after bowing  once more as a thank you and farewell. I turned and walked towards  the stairs to tell sister that I had given Yaya-onee-sama the  message.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  returned to my room, which I used to share with someone of the same  year. But she requested a room change with someone she got along with  quite well and I’ve been alone in this room for about a month now.  I didn’t mind really, It actually gave me more space and privacy…  especially since Motoko-sempai tells me that I sometimes tend to  space out and mumble when I’m day-dreaming. I did what  Yaya-onee-sama had advised and had gotten some ice from the kitchen  on my way back here. I placed them into an Ice bag and let it gently  rest on my head as I laid on my bed and awaited dinner.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Later  at dinner I found myself watching Yaya-onee-sama. To her right sat  Konohana-sempai and to her left sat Tsubomi-san. I don’t know why  but it was quite rare that Yaya-onee-sama was in the middle. Usually  Konohana-sempai was in the middle of the two, I wonder what’s going  on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  thing I’ve noticed is that Ootori-sama, has been looking at their  direction for the most part of dinner. I’ve heard rumors about  Ootori-sama and Konohana-sempai going out… but lately there were  talks about her talking to Yaya-onee-sama in private.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  hope I’m just thinking too much.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  next day… it was 5 in the morning when I heard the familiar and  very routinely sound of knocking on my door. I sat up awake and said  that I was up now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good.  I’ll wait for you as usual.” Said the girl by the door, who I was  sure is Motoko-sempai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  got changed into my jogging pants and tee-shirt, raced out of the  room after washing my face and picking up the shinai that  Motoko-sempai had given me to practice with. In a few minutes I  caught up to sempai who was swinging her sword to practice her  downward slash. She told me to do what she did…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  practiced for a few minutes. It was still cold this morning but I  could feel myself sweating already. I was feeling alright, the warmth  my body made with each swing, the feeling of getting a good exercise  from my muscles, and Yaya-onee-sama’s gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>EH?!!’</em> It took me seconds to realize, that Nanto Yaya… the Ace of the  saintly chorus and my big time crush was looking at my direction…  for the second time within 24 hours! To my surprised, Onee-sama  confirmed it… and waved at me… I blushed and lost my footing and  ended up on my behind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shinobu…  That was embarrassing.” Said Motoko, who sounded very disappointed.  She lectured me while I hang my head down in shame.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  we realized it, Yaya-onee-sama had approached us and showed me her  notebook. <em><u>“How is  your bump from yesterday?”</u></em> She had a soft concerned on her face. I felt like smiling but given  the embarrassing situation I couldn’t help it right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Iiiit’s  fine nona-now. Th-thank you…” I told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled brighter and wrote again. <em><u>“I  see. Good luck with your training then. Work hard alright?!”</u></em> She showed me the message and patted my head lightly. Causing me to  blush and smile at her concern and encouragement. And thanks to that  I was some how able to say “Ye-YES! Thank you very much!” without  stuttering too much. She then bowed and turned to leave waving till  she was a few feet away from us.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“… Onee-sama…”  I felt like drifting into a daydream… but soon found myself on the  ground again, after feeling something solid poked me from behind. I  turned to see Motoko’s bokken pointed at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sempai…”  mumbled fearfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shinobu…&quot; Motoko-sempai's voice sounded cold.  &quot;you’re drooling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My eyes grew wide in surprise. ‘<em>Eh?!’</em> I lift my wrist to wipe at my face and found out that it was true…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since  when?!!” I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since  you saw her…” she replied in a way that was very convincing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><u><strong>End  of Filler Story.</strong></u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s  notes: This was made as a filler story. As well as to feature a  fan-girling Shinobu and Motoko a little more. And maybe to give Yaya a  popular side, even if it was just one fan girl for now. They may or may  not have much of  a relation in the story... yet. But it makes a great read and more Yuri  lovin’wouldn't you agree?</span></p>
