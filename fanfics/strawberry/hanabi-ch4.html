<h1>Strawberry Panic! Hanabi (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cradlerobber.html">Cradlerobber Speedo-kun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/hanabi-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>There was a knock on the door and Yaya started slightly, knocked out of 
her concentration by the noise. The knock came again, and she smiled at 
her jumpiness, calling out a &quot;Come in!&quot; as she returned to her work. The 
door opened, &quot;Gee, I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re back so early, Hikari, I was 
sure that you&#39;d be late because of the student council thing.&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; There was a slight clearing of the throat, and the voice that 
spoke did not belong to Hikari. Yaya looked up, &quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry, I just 
expected it to be Hikari...&quot;

Tsubomi stood just beyond the doorway, right hand still lingering on the 
doorknob. In her left arm she clutched a crisp textbook to her chest 
along with a notebook, pink mechanical pencil clutched in her hand. She 
was biting her lip and looked slightly flustered, her movements 
completely paused.

Yaya stared back, strangely caught in the moment. But it had soon 
passed, and she shook her head to clear it, before speaking again, 
&quot;Well? Are you going to come in or not?&quot;

Tsubomi blushed furiously, embarrassed, &quot;Of course I am! I wouldn&#39;t just 
knock on your door for nothing!&quot; She charged into the room, closing the 
door with too much effort, and thudded herself down onto Yaya&#39;s bed. She 
glared, almost challenging Yaya to comment on her method of entry, but 
Yaya merely looked amused at her behavior.

&quot;So, what brings you here? Hikari&#39;s off somewhere... she&#39;s actually 
probably not done with all the Etoile stuff she had to do today.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t looking for her.&quot;

Yaya was a little surprised by the irritation in the other girl&#39;s tone, 
but was cut off from responding when Tsubomi spoke again, &quot;I came 
because I wanted help with my math homework... Hikari is awful at math, 
I&#39;d never ask her.&quot;

&quot;Ah... lemme see, you must have Kareda-sensei for it, right? It&#39;d 
probably be better if you asked her, though... she&#39;s really good at 
helping students out.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t want to ask her! I know you do well in math, and you did 
this stuff already, so I want your help.&quot;

Yaya shrugged, &quot;Well, alright, but I did take that class two years ago, 
so I&#39;m probably not too sharp on it any more.&quot;

But the textbook was handed over, open to the section of homework which 
Tsubomi had due the following morning. Yaya studied the page, and pulled 
out a fresh piece of paper. She nodded to the other side of the room, 
her eyes still regarding the problems presented, &quot;Drag Hikari&#39;s desk 
chair over, it&#39;ll be easier for me to show you if you sit right next to 
me.&quot;

Tsubomi obeyed, picking up the chair to bring over when it squealed upon 
being moved on the wooden floorboards. She set it down next to Yaya, and 
perched on the edge, leaning over the desk and the work being produced 
below.

&quot;Well, I did the first problem just to refresh my memory; what is it 
you&#39;re having trouble with?&quot;

&quot;Um, the part where you have to...&quot;

They worked, Yaya patiently showing Tsubomi how it was done, and Tsubomi 
following her lead. Problems were solved first by Yaya, then a few were 
done together, and finally Tsubomi took over, moving slowly through the 
page, Yaya quietly checking them as she worked on the next problem.

&quot;Well!&quot; Yaya stretched, &quot;I think you&#39;re getting the hang of it. Is that 
all there is for your homework?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Good &#150; I still have my own homework to finish!&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; Tsubomi flushed, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you still had homework to do.&quot;

&quot;Nah, don&#39;t worry about it &#150; there isn&#39;t much, and its just Japanese 
literature. Anyway, I don&#39;t mind helping either, helps break up the 
monotony of my own schoolwork.&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t want you to get behind...&quot;

&quot;Oh, please, I don&#39;t really care &#150; I don&#39;t really have to worry about my 
grades until next year if I wanna go to college.&quot; Yaya said with a wink.

But Tsubomi stood up suddenly, snatching back her homework and book, and 
pushed the chair away, looking angry, &quot;How can you say that? You 
shouldn&#39;t bother if you&#39;re not going to try!&quot; She picked up the chair 
and rapidly deposited on the other side of the room before huffing out 
of the room, slamming the door once more.

Yaya blinked, dumbfounded at the younger girl&#39;s abrupt departure. But 
she shrugged, deciding it was a bit par for the course as far as Tsubomi 
was concerned. And, besides, she did have to finish her own homework, 
even if she was not looking forward to it &#150; not to mention, it was 
doubtless she could get Tsubomi to be more agreeable even if she did 
follow her...

So it was back to the homework, at least for now.

The next day, Yaya was walking down the hallway of Spica&#39;s main 
building, headed for choir practice. She had not managed to finish her 
Japanese literature homework, and had only narrowly avoided detention &#150; 
Maeda-sensei was a big fan of the choir, and knew there was a concert 
coming up, a stroke of luck for Yaya.
One of the classroom doors rolled open, and Tsubomi stepped out, an odd 
look on her face.

&quot;Oh, hey Tsubomi.&quot;

&quot;Here!&quot;

Yaya looked down at Tsubomi&#39;s outstretched hands, hands which were 
tightly gripping a small white box with an iris bud pinned to it. She 
took the box, and gingerly opened it. Inside lay a pile of miniature 
cookies, and she smiled, &quot;Thanks, Tsubomi.&quot;

Tsubomi let her hands fall to her side and look away, her cheeks 
slightly reddened, mumbling, &quot;I just wanted to thank you for your 
help... I&#39;m sorry I got mad...&quot;

Yaya shrugged, &quot;You don&#39;t need to worry about it, I wasn&#39;t upset.&quot;

The pink-haired girl continued to look away, scuffling her feet on the 
floor, and said nothing.

&quot;Well, anyway,&quot; Yaya said, tucking the box into her schoolbag, &quot;We 
should get going, or we&#39;ll be late for choir.&quot; She turned, beckoning the 
other girl to follow her, and Tsubomi stepped up, falling into a steady 
pace close by Yaya&#39;s side. Behind them in the corridor, Hikari turned 
away. She supposed she could take a different route that day.</pre>
