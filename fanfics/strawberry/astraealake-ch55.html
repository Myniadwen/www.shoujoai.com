<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The wiki  article on the original Stopani short stories makes for interesting  reading. Tamao beat out Shizuma in most polls but Amane triumphed over  Yaya. I find this ironic when the fandom now appears to vaguely approve  of Shizuma and Nagisa but, with some exceptions, is cheering on Yaya to  stab her rival with an icepick. What's this got to with the story? Not  much. Perhaps Kanamomo can provide the icepick.</span></p>

Momomi paused, leaning against a tree. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Okay. Calm down. As much as you want to think that… it can’t be that. You know it can’t be that. </span></em>She closed her eyes. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m  just being over-optimistic, that’s all. It’s fine. I just need to clear  my head for a moment and calm down, because just because all the  classic pieces are in place doesn’t mean that’s the way it is, now does  it? The world isn’t that easy to interpret. Of course, I’ve no idea  what else she could have to say to me, but no doubt I’m missing  something obvious. That has to be it. Or perhaps something it would be  obvious only to Kaname and her warped logic. I don’t know. Just because  I don’t know what she wants, that doesn’t mean it has to be anything to  do with that…</span></em>She realised she was playing with her hair, and forced  herself to stop. She also resisted the temptation to run off and look  for a reflective surface. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Okay, calm down. Remember what Amane  said…perhaps it isn’t anything like that, but I may be running away  from the possibility, which is just as illogical as a fool’s hope. If  it is like that, well…I suppose I should approach her a little more  carefully and not press her. And then what? No, I can’t afford to think  like that either…there isn’t any foregone conclusions. I have to  examine everything logically. Above all, I have to make sure I don’t  make a fool out of myself, either way.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Right, well. Kaname has  called me out for a private meeting. That could mean anything. She  specified the lake as our location, which is somewhere of sentimental  value to us. But that could still mean anything. Whatever she intends  to say is obviously something she wants to keep fairly secret. But not  so secret she feels pressed to hide the existence of this meeting from  our friends. Note to self, must search the surrounding bushes for  Shion. That’s an aside, though. Kaname has been distracted all day, but  especially in the Church, showing she’s worried about something. That’s  probably what she wants to talk about. On the other hand, the thing  between Amane and I is definitely agitating her, so that may well be  all there is too it. No, that’s probably the most likely topic of  conversation. But we talked that over in lunchtime, and I thought  everything was resolved. And what could she have to say about that  which would be so private? I’ve no idea, really. If she wanted me to  stop going to see Amane, she could say that at any part of the day.  Does she intend to have a blazing row over this without interruption?  That’s a possibility, a pretty likely one. She did seem to be over it,  though, or at least much more reasonable than before. She skipped kendo  today, which is her new beloved pastime, and that’s unusual. Instead of  kendo, she’s off in the greenhouse with Serané. That’s the key, it must  be. It’s so very unusual, as the Etoiles really don’t let just anyone  in their greenhouse. So there’s probably a connection. But what could  Serané want that concerns me? My parents are gone, the war between them  and Serané is currently in a cold phase and she certainly has precedent  for directly approaching me. It’s not like Kaname to be used or  directed, either. On the other hand, it may be a complete coincidence  that these two events fall one after the other. It’s impossible to say  for sure. What Olesa said definitely implied that option, and when I  think about it the reactions of the others also match. They’ve been  saying…that all along, though, so it’s hardly anything new. What are  the odds that they’ve actually got it right this time around? All in  all, it’s really very unlikely that it has anything to do with that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>On the other hand, I can’t think of anything else that it is likely to be. </em>Momomi pushed her hair out of her eyes irritably, trying to think straight. <em>It  could be anything. It’s probably something totally unimportant. So  there’s no reason to get too worked up about this. That’s right. I  should just go and listen, without preconceptions. What is she gonna  say? “Actually, it turns out I’m not straight after all. So I’ve  decided to go out with you, as opposed to anyone else in a whole school  of possibilities to crush on.” Yeah, right. That’s likely. Her answer  was final and I should accept it. But if that’s the case, why is that  no one else accepts it? What was Amane talking about? The value of  hope, the importance of dreams? That’s just ridiculous, isn’t it?  Sometimes you lose, and when that happens clinging to that stuff is  childish and pointless. It’ll only hurt you and the other person, and  it foists unreasonable explanations onto them. </em>Momomi scowled at the thought. <em>What  if that was what she was feeling right now? With everyone like that,  and me pressuring her by using Amane to make her jealous, could she  really fake a confession to appease me? She wouldn’t. She’s strong,  independent, and she wouldn’t lie about something like this…but she  hasn’t been enjoying these past few days, now has she? And my obvious  disappointment must hurt her. If that’s what it is, though, that would  only hurt both of us a whole lot more. I shouldn’t have played those  stupid games with Amane. It was so immature of me… what was I thinking? </em>Momomi groaned. <em>Now I can’t even trust her words if she does confess. Great going, me.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Blast it. Thinking has been a disastrous policy so far, so shut up and walk. You’re going to be late as it is. </em>Momomi pushed away from the tree and set off for the lake, nervously brushing down her hair. <em>Well,  this is great, isn’t it? Now I hope she doesn’t anything about romance,  because if she does I’ll have to work out whether she’s being sincere  or not. Why do I have to make my life so complicated? </em>She tried to force down the apprehension churning her gut, walking through the forest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  paced compulsively up and down in front of the lake; hands tightening  around the bouquet she was keeping hidden behind her back. She forced  herself to take deep, calm breaths. <em>Crap. Am I actually going to do this? Am I actually going to confess to Momomi? Is that even possible for someone like me? </em>Kaname frowned, trying to remember what Serané had said. <em>What  was it…just tell her, simply and honestly, give her the flowers, and  explain the situation. Right. There’s the fucking problem. Explain the  situation, isn’t that wonderful? Any idiot who can string a few words  together can manage a variation on “I love you” or “wanna go out with  me?” but both of those carry certain expectations along with them. On  the other hand, I have to explain my rather complicated feelings, which  aren’t going to be easy for her to bear. No one ever said “I may love  you, I’m not sure, get back to me on that one” in any films or books.  Nor have I ever encountered “can we go out so I can work out whether or  not I’m bi”? I mean, even if that’s someone’s intentions, they probably  wouldn’t say it in as many words. But I have to say it in as many  words, as Momomi became aware of what I thought before and now I have  to own up to my increasing confusion. And through all of this, I have  to avoid coming across like a jealous idiot who’s doing purely to keep  her away from Amane. On top of that, I’m terrible at expressing honest  sentiments. Just the idea of saying something like personal is so…  well…embarrassing. Just make me immature? Am I too young for this? This  is annoying. It sounded a lot easier when Serané was talking about it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She checked her watch. <em>Damnit,  she’s late. What am I supposed to do? Brood? I’m already feeling  terrible. I’m not sure this is a good idea, either. Is this too soon?  What are my reasons? My own sincere feelings or just a stupid reaction  to everything Amane said? And is it even a good idea to use Momomi for  this? If I end up disappointing her, that will be really crushing for  us both. I don’t want to have to do that to her, but the whole point is  that I need an honest answer. Shouldn’t I have done that before,  though? If I was able to decisively know my feelings, everything would  be a lot easier. Should I have waited until I’d made sense of that?  This way, I’m risking my friendship on my own bumbling ineptitude. And  what if I don’t have an answer, even after one date? What am I supposed  to say then? </em>Kaname groaned and closed her eyes, trying to smother  those thoughts. But they kept bubbling up, like gases from the depths  of a foetid swamp, which was something she felt like at the moment. <em>Besides,  I suck at things like this. I’m passive, weak-willed and defensive, and  I lie to others and myself all the time. I’m not like Momomi, who can  just say something and assert it on the world. I’m not like Amane, so  grand and confident in her own arrogance. I’m not a strong person. Am I  even going to be able to say it? If I choked, that’d be horrible, and  mangling my lines would be even worse. I don’t blush gracefully. But  what am I supposed to do? Run away?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname checked her watch again, wincing. <em>Damnit,  she’s still not here! This glade is currently eroding my courage moment  by moment as it is! Damnit, but these trees are a whole lot scarier  than that stupid story with the giant clock and the big hole. Who on  earth favours execution by complex clockwork and moving walls when a  sword is so much quicker? That’s hardly the point, though…when is she  going to arrive? Hell, what if she doesn’t show? The last time I told  her to be here for an important matter she forgot completely and  insulted me to Olesa while I was standing in the rain. This probably  has bad karma. But still, she might not show up at all, one way or the  other. Perhaps she’s worked it out. What would she think of me? What is  she going to think of me? I’m going to come across as an oblivious  idiot at best, a jealous, possessive fool at worst. And whatever she  says, perhaps her feelings have changed. I’ve never beaten Amane yet,  so isn’t it a bloody law of the universe that I have to lose now as  well? Even if she hasn’t, she might be annoyed at me for changing my  story all of a sudden. Well, she probably will be. This isn’t enjoyable  for her. Mightn’t she just reject me on principle? Especially if I  don’t word it right…and I am not good at exact wordings, either. I just  know that the moment I stumble I’ll start self-justifying by bringing  up Amane and whatever else, and then I’m finished. What then? This  could ruin our friendship. Perhaps I’m the one who should run away? </em>Kaname closed her eyes and shook her head vigorously. <em>I  can’t do that, damnit! I’ve committed myself, and I have to do this! I  will do this! Why would I be scared? If I can’t do this even under  these favourable circumstances, I’ll be a failure forever. But still-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, Kaname.” Momomi walked slowly forwards, looking at her. Her face was stiff.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname whirled, glad she’d been facing Momomi when the girl had walked in. “Eh… hi, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi.”  Momomi’s eyes flickered downwards, taking in the fact that both of her  hands were behind her back, then returned to her friend’s face  expectantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well…uh…” Kaname tried to find words. <em>Damnit, I came up with like fifty scripted variations? What happened to that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what did you want to talk to me about?” Momomi asked. Now she looked worried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah….  that’s to say…” Kaname closed her eyes. “Well, you know earlier,  something I’d always intended to do, but I never actually did, you  know… that’s to say… thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Thank you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank  you for your feelings, because even if I didn’t accept them then, they  were a wonderful compliment… and, well, that can’t have been easy for  you… after what I said, but you’re always so brave, so I wanted to  thank you for that,” Kaname managed. Her cheeks felt like their muscles  had seized up. <em>Cheek cramp? Is that even possible? Ahahaha…</em>“Butyour  friendship, as well, that’s important too! And the way you listen and  care and the fact that… well, you know… forget it, what I’m trying to  say is, thanks for everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No problem,” Momomi replied quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it’s not like I’m saying that because I’m-” Kaname broke off from her  hasty explanation. “Wait. This isn’t what I meant to say at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry. I’m not good at this stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. But it’s okay. I know what you want to say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do?” Kaname managed to choke back a sigh of relief. <em>Well, this makes things easier.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And it’s okay,” Momomi continued, looking away. “You don’t have to pretend for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s jaw dropped. “Hey, wait! What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I just thought… you know… that you were going to say ‘<em>I like you after all</em>’  or something like that. But that’s okay. I don’t want you to force  yourself.” Momomi smiled weakly. “But I’m probably completely wrong  anyway, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, you are, damnit!” Kaname replied indignantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh…  sorry… forget it.” Momomi turned away altogether, staring at the floor.  “Sorry about that. I just… never mind. So what did you want to talk to  me about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… that’s to say… I like you after all.” Kaname  frowned, feeling this needed a little substantiation. “Probably. Maybe.  I’m a bit confused about my feelings, but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chucked quietly. “I told you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not finished, damnit! I mean it! I think…” Kaname gritted her teeth.  “Look, I’m still not sure exactly what I feel about you, but… well… I  may like you, I know I can’t stop thinking about you and I liked  everything that we did together… whatever I’m doing, it’s not  pretending, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look, Kaname… I’m sorry about Amane, I won’t see her any more, so you don’t have to-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damnit, would I pretend to be anything for your convenience?” Kaname demanded, cutting her off. “Look at me, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned to face her. Her eyes were moist and she stabbed her friend with a look of pain, anger and sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But… well…” Kaname tried to collect her words. <em>I’m not striking the right tone here. </em>“Listen,  I know I’ve been a jealous bitch about you with Amane, but that isn’t  the point. Ever since you confessed to me, at first I was scared, but  it also made me happy… and then I started to wonder…” Kaname closed her  eyes for a moment. “Fuck. I’m no good at this shit. But I like you,  okay? Really, really. Even if I’m just a friend, which I’m probably  not, it’s hard to tell, because I want to… well, do a lot of things  with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi made a little choking noise, shaking her head slightly. “You aren’t very good at this, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  caught her feeble smile. “Well, no. But still… well, I got you these.”  She pulled the bouquet out from behind her back, holding them out.  “They’re from the greenhouse, apparently grown for this stuff. Well, I  tried doing something like you did, but I’m not good at this, so I  kinda went for the simple option.” She took a step closer. “Well, take  them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi grabbed the bouquet hesitantly, looking slightly dazed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rubbed the back of her head awkwardly. “Red roses for love, right? Even I know that one…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi lowered them, staring at her friend. “Are you… serious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname managed a smile. “Come on, Momomi. I’m always serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked like she was about to burst into tears, and <em>this </em>came  easily. Kaname took three steps forwards and threw her arms round her  friend.” God… you’re still over-sensitive, you know that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tentatively returned the embrace, staring over her shoulder. “If you’re pretending, I’ll definitely kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. I wouldn’t pretend for your convenience.” <em>When she’s in my arms, it feels so warm and comfortable…it has a calming influence. </em>“But I’m still a bit of an idiot, so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You think I don’t know that?” Momomi closed her eyes. “I mean, it, though… if you’re lying I really won’t forgive you ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you don’t start taking me seriously, I won’t forgive you.” The flowers rubbed against her back. <em>What if the stems break? Well, screw it.</em></span></p>
“Yeah, yeah…”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, well… we go out, at some point, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Presumably, yes. Next Saturday?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.” Kaname scowled. <em>Damn. I should have waited till Friday. Now I’ll be distracted and impatient all of tomorrow…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll find something to do in town, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Kaname touched her head gently. <em>It feels nice…is this why she brushes my hair? I should try that with her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  rested her head on Kaname’s shoulder, looking like she wasn’t going to  move any time soon. Not that Kaname was complaining. “But… well, if you  don’t mind telling me… what made you change your mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you know,” Kaname grunted. “The usual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Is any part of this anything like usual?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know.” Kaname grunted. “But it was just… you know… the fact that,  well, I miss you when you’re not around… and how jealous I was getting…  and the fact that I missed all those little things you used to do, and,  well… generally. I may be stupid, but I’m not that stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t make any sense, so I’ll take your word for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry… for not realising earlier. But I’ve never been good at this stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll forgive you… eventually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked. “You’re still cruel and unusual. Let’s sit down, shall we? Feels like we have a lot to talk about…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just nodded, untangling herself and sitting down, facing the lake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sat next to her, looking out over the glittering surface. “The last  time we did this, you told me about your family… nostalgic, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rested her head on Kaname’s shoulder again. “A little, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  tentatively put an arm round Momomi’s shoulders, pulling her closer.  Something told her that was the right thing to do. “That wasn’t such a  long time ago, but it feels like it was in another life or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Momomi agreed. “Just remember we also had a blazing row here. It’s not all happy memories.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ruin the mood, why don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But one thing hasn’t changed. I’ve always felt safer when I’m around you… and I’ve always felt invincible in your arms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname flushed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something like that?” Momomi teased. “Is that better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat.”  Kaname frowned. “Well, I’m glad. For me, you’ve… well… I don’t know…  you care about emotions. But I never knew whether I ever offered  anything, when I was… well, myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably.” Kaname sighed, looking up at the sky. “I’m no good at saying things. It’s a problem for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not exactly good at protecting myself or anyone else,” Momomi pointed out. “This is fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.”  Kaname closed her eyes, enjoying a heady sense of euphoria. “Actually,  that was easier than I expected… it must have been harder for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fatalism  is useful.” Momomi breathed out gently. “Of course, now you’ve given me  hope, which is more dangerous and incriminating than pregnancy in some  ways.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s fine. Being indebted to you wouldn’t be so bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They watched the lake for a while longer, enjoying the silence. “You know, I can see the point now,” Kaname remarked. “It <em>is </em>kinda pretty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smirked. “You just noticed? By the way, though, I’ll still talk to  Amane, at least for a while. You won’t stop me that easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damnit.”  Kaname scowled. “Not fair. Don’t I, like, own your soul now? I’m sure  someone mentioned that while mooting the concept to me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I sold my soul long ago,” Momomi quipped. “It went very cheaply.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn. You too? I could hardly give mine away. Still not sure why you insist on Amane, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you’re my girlfriend, I still need friends as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname flushed again. <em>Girlfriend, huh? I could get used to that. </em>“Well, I know that. But why does it have to be Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  not?” Momomi prodded her on the neck. “Because she looks like you? Or  because she’s really intelligent? Or because she’s really sporty? Or  because she’s really popular? Or-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I get the idea.” Kaname  frowned. “Well, I’ll live. But now I’m morally justified in knocking  her off her horse and jumping up and down if she kisses you again.  Don’t underestimate that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, aren’t you sweet and  protective?” Momomi remarked, shaking her head. “You know, after it has  stopped being cute I’m going to have a seriously possessive, jealous  girl on my hands, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Well, enjoy it while it’s  still cute, then.” Kaname snorted. “I’ve always thought that a partner  who isn’t at least a little possessive is basically someone who doesn’t  care.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re more like the with-me-always kind, which <em>sounds </em>really  sweet until you notice it’s really crazy as well,” Momomi remarked. “I  mean, think about all those sappy romances. Am I the only one who finds  two souls as one really… well… disturbing? Romance subsumes your  individuality and turns you into a collective consciousness. Don’t do  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m with you there. That’s why it’s good that we’re so  different.” Kaname looked at the clouds. “How to put it… like ying and  yang, that’s a good place to start, but not exactly. That implies a  balance. Order and chaos is wrong as well. Instead, I’m chaos and so  are you… chaos is disunited, right, that’s why it’s chaos. So basically  we’re screwy, psychotic and generally dangerous to be around when we’re  apart, and when we’re together it gets even worse. But that’s probably  interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Oh, great. How romantic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  smirked. “What did you expect me to talk about, the red thread of fate?  Give me a break, life isn’t that clear cut even for normal people.  We’re the red cat’s cradle of yarn-related confusion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled at that. “I suppose I should be glad you believe such a thing exists at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  I’m trying to be romantic here. If I said there are probably several  thousand other girls I could happily date in Japan at a minimum, that  wouldn’t be very romantic, now would it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite. There you  go, the secret of the soulmate principle. A usual lie used to excuse  being in a bad relationship, bad behaviour or a twitching desire to get  into someone else’s pants.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More or less,” Kaname agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  one of the nice things about you,” Momomi murmured. “Considering you  get embarrassed so easily, I’m probably safe from unwanted advances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And probably wanted advances, as well.” Kaname frowned. “I’m the one who has to worry, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You see, this is why stereotype is so useless…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, is Kaname still sore because she’s so much like a guy? You shouldn’t be. It’s very cute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, even I have a little womanly pride as well…” Kaname sighed. “Oh, well. Whatever works, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Poor Kaname. Well, you’re a beautiful person anyway, so it’s fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  very easy for the porcelain doll of femininity to say,” Kaname  retorted. “The problem isn’t whether or not I’m beautiful. It’s the  fact that everyone, even Serané, appears to have forgotten that I’m  actually a girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. Be fair to us, it can be hard to  tell from time to time,” Momomi teased. “What with the trouser fetish,  the short hair, the kendo, the violent tendencies and the way you  absolutely refuse to compromise your dignity under any circumstances  whatsoever…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. Those are all sexist, aren’t they? Why can’t women be proud and controlled? Or wear trousers, come to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s the case, surely you don’t care about womanly pride?” Momomi asked. “Isn’t that just a bunch of sexist associations?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe,”  Kaname admitted. “But I blame society. They forced on me, and whatnot.  I’m sure if you worked at for long enough, you could find somebody to  blame but me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably,” Momomi agreed. “But don’t get too hung up about it. We all like our Kaname-kun just the way she is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah. That’s what I’m worried about…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The flowers are nice,” Momomi said, changing the subject. “You got them from the greenhouse, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  nodded. “Apparently Serané grows them for this purpose. She says  flowers are always good, for some reason. They’re completely useless  and fade away after a few weeks, but their romantic effectiveness is  only matched by the female love of chocolate. Or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you <em>were </em>getting help from Serané-sama…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yeah. That was for research, though, research!” Kaname shrugged. “I  make use of available resources, what else would I do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s kinda cute.” Momomi chuckled. “Of course, <em>I </em>came up with everything myself…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m better prepared than you, then,” Kaname retorted. “I spent a lot of time worrying over this, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I appreciate it. Better late than never, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  forgive me for being the confused bisexual, as well.” Kaname pouted. “I  get all the crap hands in life, you know? I’m sure I’m going to be hit  by lightning or something now I actually managed to confess to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I think dating me is your divine punishment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. Right.” Kaname frowned. “We’re not going to do more clothes shopping, are we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps  not immediately,” Momomi said, frowning. “But I’m determined that more  clothes shopping will indeed feature in the near-future. There are a  load more cute outfits I want to try with you”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… see. Something to look forwards to.” Kaname frowned. “But what do you want to do on the actual date?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure,” Momomi admitted. “We’ll have to think about it. How about  you? Did you make any decent plans with all your preparation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… that’s to say… not <em>exactly. </em>To  be honest, I was so obsessed with confession in itself that I forgot to  even think about what comes after it.” Kaname frowned. “Tennis?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, no, you don’t. I’m not spending my first date letting you kick my ass at a game I can’t play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine, fine. Just as long as we don’t go to another sappy but mind-blowingly illogical movie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Though, when I think about it, you’d probably look really good in tennis clothes,” Momomi mused. “That’d be worth seeing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dream on.” Kaname looked up again. “Well, I could ask Serané or something, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “On that note, what do you want to do about the others?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed. “Well, those three will have to know. They’ll just bug us to  hell if we don’t tell them. And I’m fine with strangers, too, I  suppose, but the idea of just walking round the school holding hands or  whatever is kind of weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose that’d interfere with your  cool-girl look,” Momomi teased. “But I suppose that’s as much as I can  expect, too. Personally, I’m fine with anything, so I’ll go with your  limits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks. I guess.” Kaname sighed. “And… well… not to  spoil the mood or anything, but I’m still a stupid little girl, you  know. If it isn’t, you know, working for me-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. That’s  fine.” Momomi smiled, rubbing her head against her girlfriend’s  shoulder. “Do you really think you could fool me anyway, Ka-na-me-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just as long as you understand.” Then Kaname blinked. “Wait, chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  if it doesn’t work, I’m sure to know as well. All a girl can ask for is  a fair chance, I suppose. I have to be mature about this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks.” Kaname sighed. “I’m just annoyed I have to jerk you around like this, but I’m not a naturally certain person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine. I’m pretty sure all relationships work out like this. Even if it doesn’t play out, we can still be friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now who’s being gloomy and defeatist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just considering all possibilities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, I’ve been doing that for days. It gets too depressing after a while. I’m sure you’ve gone through the same phrase.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty much. Even if I don’t like to admit it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, I’ve been thinking and happiness is probably statistically  improbable.” Kaname smirked. “You can call me the emo queen now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“King, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bah. You just had to make up for the slip on chan, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have to consider your reputation, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “It’s getting late. Shall we head back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">By  way of reply Momomi fell backwards, landing on the grass and looking up  at the sky. “Forget it. It’s not like I could sleep right now anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hope that’s a compliment to me, not a measure of your new-found  apprehension.” Kaname looked down at her, smiling. “You’ll get grass  stains all over your clothes, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like you did earlier? Don’t think I missed that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn.  Caught.” Kaname lay down next to her, looking up at the dusky sky.  “Well, fine. We can stay here until we get too cold and then play hide  and seek with the Sisters, if you insist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds good to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was joking. The power of love versus the Sisters… that isn’t even a  contest.” Kaname folded her hands behind her head. “I heard a guy once  dared to confess to Sister Kawakami, and not in the Christian sense  either. She beat him to death with a hardback copy of the King James  Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t spread malicious rumours, you know. Sister  Kawakami would never risk a good copy of the Bible like that.” Momomi  looked up at the sky, smiling. “But this is the kind of time when I  think, when is the last time we ever looked up at our world? Watching  the sun set and night begin… more people should do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think the problem is that people just don’t look generally, not even  around them at other people half the time,” Kaname observed. “Even if  they do, they can look without seeing. That’s practically the story of  my life, or that’s what I’m feeling now, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded.  “I know what you mean, but maybe it’s fine, you know. It’s precisely  because we don’t watch the sunset very often that it’s so beautiful to  the eye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps. But if you start to think like that, you can  have anything any way you want, right? You just have to phrase things  right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still have no sense of romance.” Momomi prodded her on the cheek. “And stop sitting on that hand, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you… oh, right.” Kaname pulled her left hand out from under her  head, placing it rather self-consciously on the ground. Momomi took it  gently with her own free hand. “Like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like that.” Momomi brushed her thumb over Kaname’s bandaged knuckles. “Honestly, you have no sense of timing at all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her hand was warm. <em>To  me, lying on the earth and looking at the sky and with her warmth  beside me, this is all very dreamlike. Is any of it real, or is it all  some phantom imagining? I’m not sure. But it is enjoyable. </em>“It’s pretty…” <em>I’m  not sure whether I mean the lake or the falling sun or the stars in the  sky or even Momomi close to me, hand on hand, heads close together. How  would you put it, this feeling? We’re sharing the unguarded  vulnerability that two people experience when they lay down close to  each other. It isn’t a sexual thing, a matter of clothes or no clothes.  But right now, I don’t really have any defences. Because right now, I  don’t need any defences. By and large, they would only get in the way  of what is most important.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m not exactly sure what is  most important. It’s not something I know well enough to frame with  dramatic words. But I’m having fun, all the same. </em></span></p>
