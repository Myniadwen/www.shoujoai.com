<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>“So, you’re back.”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, did you miss me?” Momomi asked sarcastically, shaking out her hair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  put her head against the wall, closing her eyes languorously. “On the  contrary, I’ve been savouring the time you’ve been away. That peace is  gone, now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what have you been doing?” Momomi asked,  collapsing onto her bed. “Staring at the door and working out the  biting things you’d say to me when I arrived?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I took the chance to think,” Kaname said. “Certainly, that might be alien to you. But it pleases me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You?  Think?” Momomi laughed sarcastically. “You are many things, all of them  unpleasant, but you are no thinker. I see it with every step you take.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like earlier,” she continued. “What on earth was that? She didn’t say a thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  one was the leader,” Kaname said. “She didn’t need to say anything.  There’s no point in defeating the lackeys. You must take down the  leader, and they fold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s all very well,” Momomi said. “But breaking the nose of a supposedly innocent girl does not make you look good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She deserved it,” Kaname said. “I enjoyed it. And I’m not afraid of the sisters.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  do you manage not being thrown out?” Momomi asked rhetorically, folding  her arms behind her head. “It’s unreal what they tolerate in you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My mother. That and the sisters understand more than they let on. They see past the superficial, unlike you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It would take a mind infinitely subtler than mine to see reason in your madness,” Momomi said. “That’s because there is none.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case… you seem to know a lot about this,” Kaname said. “I doubt they would have talked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I saw it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m flattered. Stalking me now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be arrogant,” Momomi said. “But I have my reasons for becoming  concerned with that group. For my own interests, not because of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re having problems with them, aren’t you?” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can hardly talk,” Momomi said. “What punishment did the Sister give you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, they said they’d isolate me, and I’d be moved out of my room,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re kidding? When are you going?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not,” Kaname said. “I laughed so much they changed their minds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  now I’m isolated from the class for the next two weeks,” Kaname said.  “Being taught by sixth years with free time instead. And I can’t leave  my room at other times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They don’t get it, do they?” Momomi said. “I wish I got gifted with a punishment like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But don’t skitter away from the topic,” Kaname said. “You’re having problems with Olesa’s group too, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m planning to deal with it,” Momomi said testily. “Someone that stupid, can’t be too hard to deal with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God,  but I hate that bitch,” Kaname said softly. “The worst kind of idiot.  She’s a weakling, but she’s got strong friends. They’re dumb, but she’s  smart. Regardless, they always and only attack lone targets, five to  one. And they pick on us, not because they have something to gain, but  because they find it fun. What sense does that make?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re getting to you, aren’t they?” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least I broke that stupid girl’s face,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The doctor said it wouldn’t cause any lasting damage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should have punched harder,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  look a mess yourself,” Momomi said. “That’s why it’s stupid. Not just  the sisters. But fighting five to one, that’s really stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, how about you?” Kaname asked. “What’s your grand plan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to outthink them,” Momomi said. “<em>I </em>can  do that. When I have proof of their behaviour, a record of everything  they’ve done, then they’ll be in trouble. I can blackmail them or  simply hand it to a Sister, or even our year. Or perhaps the Etoile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I doubt you’d ever go and beg any of those for help,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yes,” Momomi said. “I’d be uncomfortable with that. But Olesa doesn’t know that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a great plan, apart from that,” Kaname said. “Except for one thing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She turned and walked forwards, leaning down and looking intently at Momomi’s face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? That’s creepy, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  suddenly lunged forwards, dragging her up by her hands. “You’re so  weak, I can do this,” she said. “And this.” She hugged a struggling,  furious Momomi, feeling brown hairbrush against her cheek, hand running  down her body. Abruptly, the gasped and went stiff, moaning slightly.  Then Kaname let go, and was rewarded with a hard slap. She ignored it,  pushing a frightened Momomi down and pulling up her jacket at the  waist. “Your stomach,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t touch it!” Momomi said, kicking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  stared down at the patchwork of bruises. “That’s why you’re late,  right? You went to confront them. And it didn’t end well for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just picked an unfavourable situation,” Momomi said. “I’ll work on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You need to see a nurse, at least,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t pretend to be concerned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be concerned?” Kaname asked rhetorically. “If you take so much care in  my business that you spy on me, I can only return the favour. Besides,  I want you to remember one thing.” She pushed Momomi onto the bed,  looking down at her with intense eyes. “You’re <em>my </em>enemy. I’ll be the one to bring you down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  enemy,” Momomi said as Kaname turned away. “That’s pretty funny, isn’t  it? Trash picking on trash, really. I guess you can do not better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shrugged, walking across the room and sitting on her own bed. “I hate  you, Momomi. And I do think I’m holding you back. That makes it all  worthwhile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly,” Momomi said. “Holding me back from what? I  told you before; I’ve no intentions for this school, but to survive it.  I want no friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You said so before,” Kaname said. “But, to  be frank, that sounds like the affected attitude of someone who has no  friends, and so pretends they like it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve no  friends either,” Momomi said. “And you’d say the same thing. In your  case, it’s because you completely and utterly lack anything approaching  social skills, restraint, and possibly sanity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I’m alone  because I’m messed up,” Kaname said. “Cracked, you could say. And I  genuinely enjoy it, because I’m so messed up. But you… I’ve never seen  such a smooth liar. You have no excuse, and no reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you,” Momomi said. “I have a reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  last time, I got close to people,” she said, folding her arms and  glaring at the ceiling. “It didn’t end too well, for me. Because of my  stupid family. That’s all there is to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s it? Fear of your family?” Kaname said scornfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better  that, but with independent thought, than to be so screwed over by them  that they define you,” Momomi said. “That’s what you’re like. That’s  what I hate about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve chosen,” Kaname said. “Don’t mistake that. And I chose this way, because I know what I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you lack the initiative to change it,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?  Is there any point in change? No matter what I did, do you think anyone  we know could ever come to tolerate me? Let alone like me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  true,” Momomi admitted grudgingly. “Sometimes the past matters. And  even if I wanted friends, I’d have no luck either. Because of you, in  no small part.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We chose our paths ourselves,” Kaname said. “Don’t pretend anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed, tilting her head and looking at the other girl in silence for a  few heartbeats. “You know, you say more here with words than you even  do with fists, outside.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I miss the days when I was alone and happy here,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. I miss more things about last year than you could ever imagine,” Momomi said. “I hate it here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you’re the only person worth talking to I’ve ever met, here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re like me,” Kaname said. “I can’t think of any terms more damning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, then shrugged. “Yeah. I’ll bet you thought you were unique. You were that foolish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Not that I’m like you, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or me you,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be terrible,” they said, at once, then glanced at each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, I still find it odd,” Momomi said. “If you hate me so much, then why-” she fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Realised that what you were going to say was apt to be reversed?” Kaname asked. “And perhaps you wouldn’t like the answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha.”  Momomi bit her lip and closed her eyes. There was a few moment’s  silence, then she sighed. “Ah, I can’t do it. But it’s okay. We don’t  want friends, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s for sure,” Kaname said. “They’re all so <em>stupid.</em> But the way they crowd around Aname, and just drift and do everything normally… people are irritating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane  especially,” Momomi suggested. “If I had the kind of popularity she  did, I’d use it. She wastes it. And I’d even make people happier, by  using them. But… my point. We don’t want friends. But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An enemy’s okay,” Momomi said. “We can talk to an enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve always had enemies,” Kaname said. “It’s the only way to know you’re alive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And when I’m dragged back to Italy, I won’t miss an enemy,” Momomi reasoned. “We talk to each other a lot, even so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yeah,” Kaname said. “I’ve talked to you more these last six months than  I probably managed in the year and a half before that, with everyone  else put together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” Momomi said. “But you’ve been here  ever since the start of first year? That’s hard to believe, even now.  You really are stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Real unpopularity starts at the  beginning, and from then on,” Kaname said. “With a sufficiently bad  start, they’ll never give you a chance to recover. You went through the  same process, just in the middle of second year. It comes to the same  thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose it does,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My empty room was the only thing I had to look forwards to,” Kaname said. “That’s gone, now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I can certainly understand the melancholy with which one returns to  this room. But you say that so much I often wonder whom you’re trying  to convince. Don’t you like having an enemy?” Momomi smiled. “Am I too  much for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes I get tired,” Kaname said. “You’re doing well for someone so injured, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This wouldn’t stop me,” Momomi said dismissively. “It hurting doesn’t stop me talking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  are you talking because you’re hurt?” Kaname said. “I imagine that you  might need diverting, from dwelling on the circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  actually pretty smart,” Momomi said. “Outside, you just seem dull. But  you’ve got quite the incisive, over-analytical mind. You’re completely  wrong, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If no one cares what I think, why should I tell them?” Kaname asked. “But you care.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get presumptuous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the same,” Kaname said. “But I’m tired. This has been a hard day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll grant that,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes, alone is hard. And because, I need distracting. So do you. So I’m going to tell you a story.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A story?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a story about a girl,” Kaname said. “A story I hate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m listening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it begin with a man. A kind of gangster, a piece of lowlife trash with  no redeeming features whatsoever. Violence was his way, and theft, and  murder. If he wanted something, he took it. And he came upon a woman  that he wanted, and he took her. By force. He lacked the capacity for  anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her, wide-eyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the  woman was something,” Kaname said. “A Catholic. A fanatical, zealous,  insane Catholic, as thick in faith and insanity as he was in violence.  So of course, she couldn’t have an abortion. Because the words of a  stupid book and some old idiots in a far away country she’d never been  meant she had to have a child born of violence, a child she hated, a  child that had no right to life. A girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, isn’t that  inspiring, that she lived?” Momomi argued. “Someone like that, being  born regardless? It’s like a life, stolen, from this world…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  put a hand against the wall, staring at it ferociously. “Theft is the  right term. That child should never have been born. And from that  moment on, the world had no time for her. It extracted the highest  price it could for her stolen right to life. It still does that. She  never found anything worth living for. But she survived. That struggle  became her life. Her mother hated her with a passion, regarding her as  a sin and a bastard, ugly creature without merit. Almost as  incandescent as her hate for the father. Regardless of that, and  regardless of the law- he had the luck far better men than he deserved-  he took the child away. I’d call that the most responsible thing he  ever did, but nothing good ever came of it. Regardless, until eight  that child was his child, whenever he remembered, which wasn’t often.  She was always alone, and learned to live alone, except when he was  there. Then she learned how to be beaten, abused, and destroyed in  every conceivable way. But he also taught her how to fight. The best,  or the worst, thing he ever did, from the only thing he ever knew. And  she remembered. She became harder than he could have imagined, because  now she’d stolen life she had no intention of giving it back for  anyone. But that was when it began. The faults and weak-points, that  made her more an animal than human.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What happened to her?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ask  what happened to him,” Kaname said. “I said until eight. Then he got  himself killed. No one mourned his passing, least of all his child. But  the authorities wouldn’t let a little girl die alone. And somehow,  belatedly, they dragged the kicking, screaming, twisted creature back  to her mother. Grudgingly, hatefully, furiously, on both sides, she was  taken in. By her mother had no love for her. Love was something she  read about in books, after her mother taught her to read, but mostly  something that recurred in the Bible. In a world without love, that  girl had no time for the love of any God, only hate. In any case, her  treatment was no better, except that the beatings were less hard,  simply due to lack of strength. And…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s it,”  Kaname said. “At the age of twelve, she was sent to a private school,  far away, and out of her mother’s sight. It was well out of her  mother’s financial means, or inclinations, but the child insisted, and  took scholarship tests. She passed. If nothing else, she was smart and  strong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s hard to believe a story like that could be real,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you could see the girl, you’d believe it,” Kaname said. “She has no  restraint, no social skills, no understanding of people, no love and no  friendship and no goodness to give. She’s tough and strong and smart,  but she can only use those talents to hurt others and herself. She’s  been taught nothing but the capacity to take and receive harm, she has  no ability to do good. She’s been cracked, warped, distorted, broken  through. She barely lives as a human being. People merely see the  surface cracks, and think her strange. But she’s been shattered to the  core. That is the penance. That is the price, for being a sin of birth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did her mother tell her that?” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was the only thing she ever got right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s wrong,” Momomi said. “If I ever meet her, I’ll slap her, and tell her that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you a Catholic, too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  birth, not inclination. But I know sin. That’s a circle of sin, a  stratified tower of hurt on hurt, crime on crime, an insult to humanity  if not God. But the child there is the only innocent. There is no  Original Sin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An interesting type of Catholicism,” Kaname remarked, holding her knees in her hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Meet  my eyes.” Momomi stared her down steadily after she turned round.  “That’s not Catholicism. That’s bloody common sense, the rarest thing  in this world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. Its not that kind of story, though, whatever you want. It’s the darkest parts of humanity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it… just a story? An imagining?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You make your own mind up,” Kaname said. “I’m flattered, at least, that it inspired so much eloquence in you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that was an act, you’ve earned my rise to it,” Momomi said. “I’m very, very distracted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…  if that girl was real,” she said slowly. “I’d love to meet her, I  think. Anyone who could live a life like that would be so strong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that girl was real, she’d only hurt you,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I’d fight back. But I’d still be glad to meet her,” Momomi said. “Whatever happened.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, don’t tell anyone that story,” Kaname said. “It’s a story  that should never be told. And I never have told it before. But you  don’t understand how broken some people can become. You need a warning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand it,” Momomi said. “I’ll embrace it. This world should be one where that story can be told as a mere remembrance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s only a story,” Kaname said uneasily. “Don’t take things so seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi got up suddenly. “That worries you, doesn’t it? But, you know, even we have emotions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  easier,” Kaname said, looking away. “If you don’t take it seriously. If  you laugh or snort. That means it doesn’t matter. To me, too. But if  you take it seriously… I have to, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi walked over to  her, looking down. She felt… what? Something. Something she found  difficult to place. She hated Kaname. She liked Kaname. As she hated  and liked herself, because Kaname was like her. They fought. They  called each other “enemy”. They sparred verbally with every breath.  Contempt and mockery artfully mitigated every show of concern. But the  concern was there. And when they reached out to each other with their  words, what they meant to say and what they said were two different  things. Kaname had told that story as a show of strength. Momomi wanted  to think that it was a lie. Perhaps it was. But her intention had been…  betrayed. Her words were twisted by that uncanny way the boyish girl  she hated touched her, with words designed to hurt. And she reached  out, and Kaname shied away, and was afraid. And that scared her. Why?  “Suddenly, I think we’re a lot less strong than we like to think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  froze for a moment, poised between conflicting instincts and emotions.  To fall one way, or the other… which was better? She didn’t know, and  the struggle felt like it was pulling her apart. If that was happening,  everything she’d done for the past six months wouldn’t help. Maybe.  But… too much thinking. She closed her eyes, and flung her arms round  Kaname’s neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The girl went stiff, gasping slightly. One hand  reached out and touched Momomi’s arm, then she froze again as Momomi  laid her head against her shoulder. “It’s okay,” the brown-haired girl  said softly. “It’s okay… just once… for my to hug my enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked down. “Stop it,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And it casts my own wounds into relief. Who am I doing this for? You? Or me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay… it’s okay…” Momomi said softly. She wasn’t sure who she was trying to persuade. “To be a girl. Just once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop it… stop… it hurts…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  stomach twinged with pain. She ignored it. “You can stop me,” she  whispered. “If you don’t want this, hurt me. Throw me off, toss me  away, you’re so much stronger, you’re so strong. But I don’t want that.  Do you want that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t… get it,” Kaname said in a low voice. She stared at the floor. “How?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you expect me to run away?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m the one running away. I like that… but you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  okay,” Momomi said, more simply. She reached out and touched Kaname’s  face. Tears. She felt a rush of shock. A rush of fear. “Why…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you were me…” Kaname choked, “you’d hate that touch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  turned, looking at her with those eyes. Hard blue eyes, framed by blue  hair. Even streaked by tears that face was strong, harsh, and  independent. Everything she wished she could be. But she could see  through the mask that had cracked in tears and suffering, and there was  anguish beneath. It resonated with the pain she bore in her heart, and  for an instant she couldn’t move. This… this was what she’d done to  Kaname.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay,” Kaname said. She turned fully, and threw her  arms round her. For a few seconds, they held the embrace, then they  fell down, brown hair spilling across white sheets, the world wheeling  around them. For a heartbeat’s breath, that was all they needed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What  would this be, for it to be a new moment? I can only imagine. But it’s  a new moment for me, too, when I really think about. I had a sister,  and though we were close, once, we never did this. What is this? Why am  I doing this? I thought I could understand this, but I don’t understand  anything at all. I’m pained. I’ve been pained since… to long. And I run  away. Only now, I’m turning to it. And for what? This… violent, cruel,  crude, savage, cultureless, guiless hateful creature… and here and now,  those words are so far away. I can’t feel the passion, the anger. Was  that ever real? It’s like the world is different, here. All I can see,  say, is strong, tough, wilful, independent, and that’s everything I  want to be. Is she that? Am I just saying that? Why does this moment  feel like a prism? Everything’s distorted. There’s nothing I can know.  It’s… scary. I have everything planned out. I’m always in control, I  never let anything but that happen. Except with Kaname, when I’m flying  on my wit alone, only we always know what’s going to happen. There are  rules. No, not rules. An understanding. I’ve broken that, clean  through. We’ve no idea what we say, what comes next. That’s so  frightening. And yet, so exhilarating.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But this must be what it feels like. To have a family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A little,” Momomi said, collecting herself. “But not that much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s all I have to go on,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One day, for you, things will be different. That’s my promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t put much stock by it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yes, that was right. That was how they’d return to this world.</em> “You won’t, which is why I’m right,” Momomi said serenely. “You wouldn’t know anything about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re so oversensitive, though,” Kaname said. “It’s ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Says the girl who cried.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  cry for myself. There’s no shame in that. But that you’re so effected  by someone else’s sorrow, when you should use it- that’s weakness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. When I take on the burden of your sorrow. That’s strength. You, who can’t even bear your own pain- that’s weakness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not sure,” Kaname said. “I’m tired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No, things had changed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I’m not through yet. I’m fighting. One day, I’ll win. Then, I’ll tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I’ll wait, I guess,” Momomi said, feigning a tired patience. “You’re not giving me much choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you?” Kaname asked. “Still running away?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  said nothing for a few moments. To her surprise, her heart was  pounding. “I’m… sorry. I still need to run, and I need to think. Now  I’m thinking, at last. One day, I’ll tell you. That’s a promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop making promises,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get  used to them,” Momomi said. “This is the first time in six months I’ve  felt like guaranteeing anyone anything. I’m not going to stop just  because of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What time is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. Can I get up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought you’d never ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Later,  they’d spar again. Later, they’d exchange the whispered thoughts of  twisted and incisive minds. Later, they’d again be the two enemies who  saw themselves in each other. But for a few minutes, in that place and  that time, they were silent, a silence of thoughts they could never  commit to words. Because one, then the other, they’d reached out. For a  moment, they’d touched. And the world had changed forever. That echoed  in their thoughts.</span></p>

“You’re not doing anything.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve finished.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  it’s terrible, no doubt,” the sixth year said irritably. “You’ll stay  here the same length of time, regardless of how much you rush, you  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname didn’t answer, simply sliding the sheet of paper across the desk. Then she returned to her meditations. <em>Momomi…  that girl has confused me. I’ve either been checkmated, or got Momomi  but good, or maybe both, or something else. It was excruciatingly  embarrassing, and confusing. My only</em><em>consolation is that Momomi  too lost control. So no doubt we’ll never suffer to speak of it again.  Mutual hypocrisy is our motif, but that’s just too painful to discuss.  No, not entirely painful. That’s what’s so confusing. I can’t believe I  lost it like that. It makes no sense. After all these years in control…  what is it about that girl? She’s dangerous. Incredibly dangerous. She  just messes with my head, in a way that has nothing to do with her  being clever and everything to do with her merely being herself. Just  like Aname- but like Aname, my passionate hate isn’t hate through. But,  no, I don’t admire Momomi that way. At the same time, she makes me talk  just by being her… it’s like her opinions matter to me, or something.  It all makes no sense- especially as- it’s almost fun to be around her.  This is- bad. I need to find some subtext. Some way to get away from  her. But I don’t </em>want <em>to-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Full marks,” the girl said grudgingly. “How do you do it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then your history book. Pages 117-126, take full notes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t bother to reply to that, simply pulling out the relevant book,  turning to a fresh sheet on her pad of paper, and beginning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s wrong with you? Cat got your tongue?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname didn’t reply, scribbling down her first note without looking up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  senpai sighed irritably. “You’re allowed to talk, you know.” She waited  for a reply that did not come. “Fine. It’s lunchtime in fifteen  minutes. You can take a break then. And I’ll expect you to actually  speak, at that point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This one’s annoyingly curious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  are you afraid of being punished, or of your seniors? You never talk at  all, when you’re being punished. I guess that’s fear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now if that was Momomi, I’d rise to it. But you’re not Momomi. Not even close.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m distracting you, then. I’d congratulate you on your conscientiousness if you weren’t a vicious bully.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You’re not very bright, are you? But I don’t get it… why </em>are <em>you talking to me? </em>She looked up for a moment. <em>Yes.  Sympathy, of all things. Hard work can excuse a lot of things, it  seems. That, and this girl would just love to get through to me on some  level. That’s not going to happen.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never mind. Just keep working.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  kept working in a detached manner until lunch break, then stopped and  simply rested without saying a word. She wondered idly what Momomi was  doing. Probably eating alone in the canteen, or planning another  suicidal confrontation with Olesa. It wasn’t of much importance. And  surprisingly, she didn’t find the image that funny, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you have a lunch?” the senpai asked eventually, after growing bored of watching her implacable subject.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Idiot… fine. I’ll go get one when the Etoile arrives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etoile?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At  least one of them should be visiting you. No doubt you’ll receive a  lecture from her, and won’t say a word. A waste of their time…” There  was a knock at the door. “Ah, here she is.” The senpai stood and walked  across the cabin, opening the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned slightly. <em>As  she said, a waste of their time. And everyone’s. This is so futile.  They’d expel me if I wasn’t from my disadvantaged backgrounds. Looks  good in reports, but by God it pisses me off…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just let me through. It’s not that hard, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sat bolt upright. <em>What? What’s she doing here?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  didn’t bring a lunch, did she? She just does it to be awkward, I’m  sure. Well, I have one here, two in fact. Aren’t you lucky that I came?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi! What are you doing? I can barely stand your company in the dorms!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you go hungry, then you’ll be even more irritable!” Momomi shot back,  stepping past the protesting senpai. “And if you did do this just to be  a pain, I’m not letting you have your way!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the one being a pain! No one wants you here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  Well, I don’t want to be here,” Momomi said. “But I’m doing it because  I enjoy being a pain. So you’ll need a better argument than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “You’re not going to go away, whatever I say, right? So fine. Come in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait a moment!” the senpai said angrily. “You don’t just barge in here-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  walked past her and sat, lowering the tray and folding her arms. “Here.  You’ve no idea the trouble it took me to bring that all the way here,  so you’d better be thankful. I haven’t even spilt the soup.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t ask for this,” Kaname said. “Though despite that, you’ve taken  some care to bring the food I like. Very considerate of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The way you eat, it’s easy to tell what you like,” Momomi said. “I have to pick it out of my hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stuck-up snob, you are. I thought only servants fetched and carried?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  only a thug would be here in the first place,” Momomi said. “And if you  wanted slavery, you should have joined Miator. As it is, I’ve doubly  lowered myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The senpai opened her mouth to shout, and paused suddenly, just watching.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s right. That’s her. That’s my weak-point. </em>Kaname took a sip of her soup. <em>But you’re not smart enough to use it. </em>“You’re right. Even first-years would have got this here sooner, and less cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’d have dropped it half-way there to punch someone,” Momomi said. “Consider it a relative measure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t have brought it at all. I don’t have that much time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, quite. Always in various punishments, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But thanks. It’s appreciated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, then snorted. “Now <em>that</em>, I don’t believe.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“When  you can call politeness a particular way to unsettle the enemy, you can  deny the true thanks underneath for quite some time. But from that day  on, somewhere…we knew it was there. Gratitude for each other. That’d  we’d met each other. Small things, pebbles piled up, shifted a trickle  of the water that was the river of our lives until, step by step, we’d  diverted a raging current, then everything. Something like that?”  Momomi smiled, twisting a blade of grass in her fingers. “But it was  you, not me, who placed the first pebble.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You built on those foundations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I did. But I needed them to be there.”</span></p>
