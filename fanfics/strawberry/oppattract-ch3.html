The whole class was surprised that Nanto Yaya, Spica&#39;s greatest 
delinquent, was early this particular morning... something that very 
rarely... No! It never happened before. She sat slouched on her table 
resting her head on her folded arms as she feigned sleep facing the 
window. She had been there a while and her roommate Hikari no where in 
sight yet.

Worriedly one of their more braver and concerned classmate, for their 
new and seemingly kidnapped new classmate that is, walked up to the girl 
and asked; &quot;Where&#39;s Konohana-san?&quot; the tone of her voice suggested that 
of strong aggression as she put up a brave front, while her legs were 
actually visibly shaking in fear.

But the raven haired girl ignored her. She had sensed the well hidden 
tone of panic embedded in the girl&#39;s voice, being feared most of her 
young life... she had learned to pick up even the slightest hint of fear 
from a person. The girl then decided that she was in a good mood, but 
since anything she could and would do will definitely scare the most 
girls... she decides not to respond, hoping the girl&#39;s fear will get to 
her before she actually tries to do anything to turn her mood sour.

Unfortunately for Yaya the girl was than she had expected and even more 
concerned of the blonde transfer student than her own well being. The 
girl placed a hand on Yaya&#39;s shoulder and pulled her up so that she sat 
upright. She bared her teeth as glared angrily at Yaya hoping that she 
could somehow intimidate the delinquent enough to respond.

&quot;Where&#39;s Konohana-san!?&quot; the girl asked again this time in a sort of 
angry voice. Yaya found it clever of the girl to hide her fear from 
herself by getting herself angry it wasn&#39;t original but it was &#39;well 
executed&#39; she noted. But Yaya was not the least bit threatened by the 
girl, instead she seemed rather amused.

She smiled at the girl, who immediately took her hand of the raven 
hair&#39;s shoulder as if the girl her hand was almost burned. &quot;I&#39;m sorry; I 
was a little sleepy... what was your question?&quot; Yaya asked in a very 
refined tone.

The girl swallowed audibly, her angry quickly dissipated and forgotten 
as the fear she tried to keep inside burst out with a vengeance and was 
now terror... absolute terror. She&#39;s heard of all the things that Nanto 
Yaya, nicknamed after some poisonous flower because of the paralyzing 
fear her aura seems to induce to her fellow students with a mere touch, 
look, smile or word, but she always thought that it couldn&#39;t possibly be 
true... and unfortunately for her she was dead wrong. And regretted 
everything she did for the past three to five minutes.

Just then the door opened and revealed a cheery blonde girl. &quot;Good 
Morning Everyone!&quot; she happily greeted her classmates aloud as she 
closed the door behind her. As Hikari headed to her seat her face beamed 
happily despite pretense of her voice to sound even the tiny bit upset. 
&quot;Yaya-chan! Why did you leave me behind?&quot;

This surprised everyone... Hikari was... more than ok. She looked better 
than when she came in to introduce herself to the class yesterday. And a 
common thought plagued their minds at that moment. &#39;Did she just call 
her Yaya-chan!?!&#39;

But the raven haired girl just kept smiling as she turned her attention 
to her blonde roommate. And instead of an answer she stood and pushed 
her desk closer to Hikari&#39;s, sat down, and urged the blonde girl to take 
her seat.

All the surprised eyes of their classmates fell on Hikari for a moment, 
before they moved to Yaya, and back again. They were all more shocked 
and confused. Hikari nervously walked over and sat on her seat only to 
almost stand up again when she felt the weight of her raven haired 
friend lean on her shoulder. She looked and noted that the girl had her 
eyes closed, both hands took hold of her left hand playfully tickling 
her palm and wrist.

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot; she softly called to her as she withheld the tiniest hint 
in her voice that the raven hair&#39;s attempt to tickle her was working.

A soft and gentle; &quot;Hmmm?...&quot; was Yaya&#39;s only response.

&quot;Everyone&#39;s looking at us...&quot; Hikari said her nervousness obvious in her 
tone.

Yaya opened one eye and shot an evil one eyed glare at everyone in her 
sight range which caused them all to look away and quietly take their 
seats. She then closed her eye again and asked if anyone else was still 
staring. Hikari felt sorry for her classmates and decided to tell the 
raven haired girl that no one was even if there were still a few. They 
remained like that for a while; the blonde girl was now quite red faced 
from embarrassment and from holding the laughter that the raven haired 
girl was very erotically trying to tickle out her.

The door then opened and their homeroom teacher slowly walked in for her 
first class. This was one of the rare days that she isn&#39;t in the mood to 
be playful and actually lets the class greet her normally, or at least 
she had expected them too. She soon realized that everyone&#39;s attention 
was locked at the two girls who sat on the last two seats at the back of 
the room. But more importantly at what one of those girls was doing. 
Misato instantly blew a fuse.

&quot;NANTO-KUN!!!&quot; the purple haired teacher yelled out so loud it was heard 
by the whole 2nd year floor.

&quot;Hm?&quot; Yaya lazily opened her eyes and looked at her teacher; anyone 
would have sworn that she was smiling inside from the way her eyes 
gleamed happily despite the blas&eacute; look on her face.

Now even though Misato Katsuragi was a very tolerating teacher, she was 
fun, athletic and in tuned with her students even with other delinquent 
students... but delinquent students never seemed to be quite the real 
description of Nanto Yaya, as much as she wish it did as it would 
probably make her life much more easier. The raven haired girl was 
different from all delinquents you see... she ruled them all in the 
shadows with an Iron Fist or at least that&#39;s what this purple haired 
teacher thought and believed.

&quot;Would you PLEASE... Get off your seatmate and put return your table to 
where it was so that I might begin classes.&quot; She said as she tried to 
hold off any and all aggression from her voice. A part of her told her 
that the raven haired girl wouldn&#39;t listen to her. But that was easily 
forgotten and/or ignored.

Yaya let a soft and short giggle escape her lips before actually and 
surprisingly doing as her teacher requested. She then took her seat and 
resumed her feigned laziness by pretending to sleep while the annoyed 
teacher started class. To Misato&#39;s surprise she was oddly disappointed 
that Yaya had actually obeyed her order and would sometimes be caught by 
her other students mumbling to herself about it for the rest of that 
day.

Hours later, Yaya had decided to leave class early leaving before the 
lunch bell rang and Hikari at the mercy of her very curious classmates.

&quot;Konohana-san?!&quot; they called as they hovered around her desk.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Hikari said wearily.

&quot;What happened yesterday?!&quot; One girl asked.

&quot;Are you okay?!&quot; asked another.

&quot;Did she hurt you?&quot; and another.

&quot;Why is that delinquent nice to you?&quot; and another, all at the same time.

Hikari looked confused not sure of what question she heard first, who to 
answer and what to answer. She turned from girl to girl unsure of who to 
answer first.

A twin tailed girl decided to assist the poor nervous and almost panic 
stricken blonde. &quot;Girls! Girls! Calm down. You all are asking more 
questions that poor Konohana-san can hear.&quot; She said quite calmly.

The blonde girl turns to her rescuer and smiled. &quot;Thank you! 
Tousaka-san.&quot;

Rin returned her smiled before she said; &quot;If you want to thank me you 
can start by satisfying our curiosity. So... what happened?&quot; Tousaka Rin 
had known Nanto Yaya even before they entered Spica. They were 
classmates most of their elementary school life. But it was a 
coincidence that they were sent to the same school by their families, 
though she can be sure that the Nanto heir was sent her for a bigger and 
more complicated reason than her own. But in all their years together 
she had never seen the raven haired girl act so seemingly affectionate 
before, or at least not to another person. And so as much as it was none 
of her business... her curiosity told her to make it her business.

And so under the pressure of her very curious classmates, Hikari had no 
choice but to tell them all that had happened. She told then all that 
happened concealing the extremely juicy details in well chosen and 
thought of words or skipped a few moments of the event here and there. 
She told them of what Yaya did to annoy their homeroom teacher enough to 
make her shout out loud this morning. And...

&quot;... she then helped me purchase the things I needed and gave me a tour 
of the dormitory.&quot; Hikari finished her story.

Most of the girls held a blush and some with their mouths wide open... 
either in disbelief or an odd sense and mix of envy, disbelief and maybe 
even some pity. From the looks in their eyes they had many other 
questions to ask but could not quite word them yet. And Hikari decided 
she&#39;d take this opportunity to get away from them and find some safety 
around Yaya. She quickly got up with her purse and rushed out of the 
classroom, declaring a &#39;see you later, I&#39;ll go on ahead.&#39; to her 
classmates without once looking back.

Meanwhile... Yaya was under a Sakura tree just right outside the school 
cafeteria. She had brought a book with her and pretended to read it, 
while she was actually trying to take another nap. She then heard 
footsteps approach her... but decided she will pretend to ignore the 
presence, especially since from the way this person walked she was quite 
sure the person had walked in a way that ruffled the grass more than 
necessary to announce her presence. What better thing to do to annoy 
someone who wants to be noticed.

This new person stopped in front of Yaya and remained silent for a 
moment. She didn&#39;t react to the presence one bit, even when the new 
arrival&#39;s shadow covered her book. It took only thirty six point forty 
one seconds for the person&#39;s patience to wear thin.

&quot;Yo! Nanto Yaya-kun.&quot; greeted the tall blue haired girl.

&quot;Ah!...&quot; Yaya looked up and recognized the person, her boyish short hair 
style obviously still there that it was almost tempting her to laugh at 
again when she instantly recalled what she had done to make her cut it, 
but then with a pretentious forgetful look and an almost anime tilt of 
her head she followed saying; &quot;...Who are you again?&quot;

This enraged the already impatient senpai. &quot;How could you still forget?! 
I&#39;ve told you my name about four hundred thirty nine times to this 
date!&quot;

&quot;Eh!? So many times!&quot; Yaya said as she feigned a very fake look of shock 
and surprise.

&quot;Yes... quite...&quot; the taller girl gritted her teeth trying to hold her 
anger.

Ignoring the fact that her blue haired senpai&#39;s patience was dying she 
adds; &quot;I&#39;m surprised that you&#39;ve kept count...&quot;

&quot;The only reason I do is to reiterate to you how bad your memory is.&quot; 
The taller girl said, the tone of her voice clearly venomous.

But the raven haired girl seemed unaffected by this and said; &quot;Ah... 
sure it is...&quot;

&quot;Well you better remember it from now on! My name is Ootori Amane! 
Oo-To-Ri A-Ma-Ne!&quot; She said quite loudly, not particularly caring if she 
was heard by anyone other than the raven haired girl in front of her.

&quot;I see... so what&#39;s does the temperamental Prince of Spica, Kaname-chan 
want with me?&quot; Yaya asked as she stood up and faced the taller girl.

&quot;It&#39;s Amane!! Not Kaname!!&quot; yelled the blue haired girl and had this 
been one of those animes on people download off the internet, one 
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if her ears let out steam or if her mouth spat 
fire.

&quot;Yes... yes... Amane-chan.&quot; Yaya said lethargically.

&quot;Che... I feel like a wasted my breath on you...&quot; she paused and gave 
herself time to pout at the raven haired girl before; &quot;And that&#39;s 
Ootori-sempai to you!&quot; She corrected followed by a distinct angry growl.

&quot;Yes... yes...&quot; Yaya said uncaringly before muttering; &quot;Who could forget 
name like that, Idiot...&quot; low enough that Amane wouldn&#39;t hear it or at 
least not clearly.

&quot;Did you say something?&quot;

&quot;No I did not... A-ma-ne-chan.&quot; Yaya purposely pronounced each syllable 
clearly and slowly to fuel the taller girl&#39;s already hot temper.

&quot;I said... that&#39;s O...&quot; Amane was about to yell at the raven haired girl 
when Yaya suddenly touches the top of her head and compares her height 
with her&#39;s.

&quot;Ah! Amane! Did you grow another centimeter?!&quot; Yaya asked looking 
convincingly surprised.

&quot;WHAT!!!&quot; Panicked by the information Amane stands straight and tries to 
compare her height with Yaya&#39;s.

Taking that as her cue the raven haired girl bends her knees just a tiny 
bit and relaxes her body so as she doesn&#39;t seem that tall. In a few 
seconds Amane notices a distinct difference in her own height compared 
to the last time she checked.

&quot;Oh! MARIA-SAMA!!! I grew even taller?!&quot; Amane yelled out with a mixture 
of anger and sadness.

&quot;No... I was lying.&quot; Yaya said blandly as she innocently looked away 
from the blue haired girl whose eyes seemed to be close to tears.

It took the taller girl a few seconds to realize her deceit and Amane 
could only...; &quot;NAAAAANNNNTOOOOOO!!&quot; loudly, very loudly, growl out 
Yaya&#39;s name.

The raven haired girl turned around from her and pretentiously covered 
her ears.

At little ways from the two... Tousaka Rin and Hikari were together as 
they began their walk out of the cafeteria. Hikari hung her head 
apparently still a little disappointed at herself because she wasn&#39;t 
fast enough nor did she have enough stamina to out run the her twin 
tailed classmate earlier. What seemed to gloom the blonde girl the most 
was that her talent for hiding, one thing she thought she was good at 
didn&#39;t seem to work for Rin... she and she even hid inside the skeleton 
locker of the science lab. She wondered if this girl was could smell her 
or wash she magician or something.

&quot;I just noticed Konohana-san, You bought two sandwiches and juices.&quot; Rin 
noted as she took a short glance inside the plastic bag the blonde girl 
had in hand. She had really meant was to ask why Hikari had bought two, 
but realizing her error she decides not to correct herself, it wasn&#39;t 
that important a question, but if the girl could pick up on the 
suggestive nature of her words it would help to continue a conversation.

Hikari nodded; &quot;Yeah... I couldn&#39;t find Yaya-chan inside the cafeteria 
and I thought maybe she hasn&#39;t eaten yet.&quot; She answered in a soft almost 
hushed tone.

Rin couldn&#39;t help but smile and thought that Nanto was one lucky bitch 
to catch such a sweet girl&#39;s attention. She then threw those last 
thoughts away and realized that Hikari might be something good for the 
raven haired girl. After all it was just the blonde girl&#39;s first twenty 
or thirty hours in Astraea Hill and already the delinquent girl is 
showing some change.

&#39;Yeah... it would probably be nice if she changed some of her attitude.&#39; 
Rin thought to herself. &#39;With a few tweaks in her personality and a year 
or two for her popularity to spread, she just might become Etoile.&#39;

&quot;Um... Tousaka-san.&quot; Hikari softly called out to the twin tailed girl, 
immediately breaking her out of her thoughts.

&quot;Yes?.. Ah!&quot; It took a few seconds for Rin to realize that she had been 
called with her family name, something that she wanted rectified 
immediately. She turned to the blonde girl and placed her arm on the 
girl shoulder in a very friendly manner. &quot;You can call me Rin. We&#39;re 
friends now right?&quot; she said with a smile.

Hikari beamed, happy to hear the word. &quot;Thank You, Rin-san. Please call 
me Hikari.&quot;

Rin nodded in approval before noticing the two arguing figures from 
afar. And noticing her attention waver Hikari turned to see what had 
stolen her new found friend&#39;s interest from her. She was ecstatic for a 
moment when she saw the unforgettable image of her roommate.

&quot;Ya!...&quot; The young blonde was about to run towards her Yaya and ask her 
to eat with her... when she noticed that her raven haired friend was 
talking to another person.

Noticing the blonde&#39;s diminishing excitement at the sight of the tall 
blue haired girl she decided to fill her in with all the known and 
possibly untrue speculation and details. &quot;That&#39;s Ootori Amane, A.K.A. 
Prince of Spica, 4th year, loves horse back riding... Etoile candidate 
if Shion-sama can get her to run.&quot;

&quot;Etoile?&quot; Hikari mumbled confused by the new term.

&quot;Ah! It&#39;s a position held by two girls, who are elected from and by the 
three schools. It&#39;s almost like a place in the student council but with 
different responsibilities.&quot; Rin explain it as simple as she could.

Scratching her head a little Hikari responds sheepishly; &quot;I don&#39;t really 
get it but it sounds hard.&quot;

The twin tailed girl lets out a soft giggle in agreement.

&quot;By the way... why doesn&#39;t Ootori-san seem to be afraid of Yaya-chan 
like the other girls?&quot; Hikari asked as she watched the taller blue 
haired girl yell as the seemingly uncaring raven haired girl.

&quot;Hmmm... I&#39;d say it&#39;s her size.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot;

&quot;Amane-san is tall after all... maybe the height gives her some courage 
most girls don&#39;t.&quot; Rin said her voice clearly saying that her words were 
not a statement but mere speculation.

&quot;Height... huh?...&quot; the blonde girl mumbled out absently.

&quot;Or maybe she&#39;s just so angry at her she forgets Yaya is scary.&quot; The 
twin tailed girl said again in speculation.

Hikari looked at Rin and noticed how her eyes gleamed as she looked at 
the two.

Rin felt her gaze and turned to her side and looks at Hikari. &quot;Is 
something on your mind Hikari?&quot;

The blonde girl nods and asks; &quot;Are you afraid of Yaya-chan, Rin?&quot;

&quot;Not one bit.&quot; Rin straightforwardly replied as she smiled proudly 
towards Hikari.

Relief filled Hikari, she was happy to know that her new friend was not 
afraid of Yaya. Her new concern was if her raven haired roommate 
disliked the twin tailed girl.

Back under the cherry blossom tree, Amane was trying to sermon the 
lessons of becoming a better person to Yaya, which was clearly not 
working as the raven haired girl decided to ignore her and tried to 
occupy her time and mind by reaching for a pink blossomed branch just 
over her head.

But Amane wasn&#39;t one who appreciated being ignored. &quot;We&#39;re not allowed 
to take those you know.&quot;

&quot;I want it.&quot; said the shorter girl as she gave the taller one a blas&eacute; 
look.

The blue haired girl lets out a weak sigh before she reached up for the 
branch and breaks it off.

&quot;Here.&quot; She said indifferently as she handed the branch to Yaya.

Unfortunately for the blue haired girl Yaya knew almost perfectly what 
would immediately get on her nerves. Pointing at the branch a few inches 
above the one Amane had just taken she said in a monotonous tone; &quot;I 
wanted that one.&quot;

Amane looked up and clearly saw that if the raven haired girl couldn&#39;t 
reach the first branch there was no way she could reach this one. &quot;Why 
bother, it&#39;s the same thing!&quot; she said again trying to hand the broken 
branch to her kouhai.

Yaya does take it but again points at the branch. &quot;I want that one!&quot; she 
repeated in the same monotonous tone.

The taller senior just leers down at the girl to try and make her give 
up. But in an odd twist... she sees the smaller girl give her a pleading 
smile and said; &quot;sen-pa-i...&quot;

And before she could realize what she was going to do, she had jumped, 
grabbed and broken the branch, landed and handed the branch to her.

Yaya looked down at the branches in her hands for a moment before she 
looked at girl nicknamed prince. &quot;You actually took it... don&#39;t you know 
you&#39;re not allowed to take them?&quot; she said with an undetectable hint of 
amusement.

&quot;What is that supposed to mean!? You wanted them didn&#39;t you?!&quot; she 
defended, trying to lay blame to the raven haired girl for wanting the 
branch.

&quot;This and that have nothing to do with me. I only said I wanted them.&quot; 
Yaya turned away from her and smiled to herself, absolutely happy that 
she had tricked her blue haired senpai again.

&quot;Why y-you... y-you... y-you...&quot; she stammered the word frustrated that 
the annoying kouhai had once again made her embarrass herself.

&quot;Ah!&quot; Yaya noticed that Hikari with Rin as the distance. &quot;Hikari!&quot; She 
calls to her and motions for her to come closer.

The twin tailed girl noticed the unmistakable color of a blush on 
Hikari&#39;s cheeks as they walked closer to the two girls under the cherry 
blossom tree. The raven haired girl quickly walked up to the blonde and 
swiftly moved behind her before wrapping her arms around her almost 
possessively. This only makes Hikari blush even more.

&quot;Have you eaten lunch yet Hikari?&quot; she asked the blonde girl with a soft 
and semi seductive voice.

Hikari swallowed a nervous gulp, before she looked at her roommate and 
said shyly; &quot;Not yet. Would you...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Would you... like to join me?&quot; she asked as she lifted her plastic bag 
within Yaya&#39;s field of vision.

Without a thought, the raven haired girl immediately nods in agreement 
and leads her under the cherry tree&#39;s shade. The two sit down, the raven 
haired girl completely ignoring the presence of two other girls as 
Hikari handed her the second juice and sandwich. The blonde and the two 
other girls watched as Yaya consumed the sandwich with ease and grace, 
something unusual to do when eating a simple bread meal such as this 
one.

Noticing their gazes, Yaya shoots Rin and Amane a look before stating; 
&quot;Are you going to gawk or eat?&quot;

The two looked at each other before sitting themselves in the tree&#39;s 
shade and taking their meals out of their small bags and joins the two. 
Most of the meal&#39;s conversation was between Rin and Amane. As Yaya was 
set on taking a nap while resting her head on Hikari&#39;s lap as soon as 
she finished her meal with the blonde watching the girl&#39;s peaceful 
sleeping face.

&quot;Is she always like this?&quot; Hikari asked Rin.

The twin tailed girl spared a look at the sleeping delinquent; &quot;Not that 
I know of...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen her so tame.&quot; Added Amane. She scratched the back of 
her head oddly confused at the delinquent kouhai&#39;s behavior. &quot;If she 
wasn&#39;t annoying the hell out of me just earlier, I&#39;d probably say this 
isn&#39;t the same person.&quot;</pre>
