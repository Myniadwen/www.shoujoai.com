<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Emphatically/definately/ not a second date chapter. Keep telling yourselves that, girls.</span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">This is almost a date, isn’t it? </span></em>Momomi looked across the table at her friend, watching as she started on her miso soup. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">In  this kind of situation, the two of us alone and opposite each other in  a restaurant, it’s impossible to deny that thought. This is definitely  almost a date. What’s missing is the understanding that it is one,  because Kaname knows with her certainty that it is not. Unfortunately,  I lack that certainty, which is what makes things so incredibly  difficult. If we were just friends, that would be fine. If I felt these  things for her but kept them in check and she knew about it and  accepted that, that would be painful… but I’d be able to live with  that. If we were a couple, that would be brilliant, but that isn’t  going to happen. However you look at it, she’s made her opinion clear  more than once. To judge by my family, I should be glad that she can  intellectually if not instinctually tolerate me. But even when I can  acknowledge that, my feelings won’t let me escape that easily. I don’t  even know how to define them but they know how to mess with my head. I  need to say it, even if only to confirm the truth I already know. But I  can’t say it, because I can’t risk losing her. That other option, that  she’s so shocked and disgusted she can’t stand to be with me any more,  I wouldn’t be able to accept that. I might as well go back to Italy and  learn to hate myself. Am I doing her too little credit? All the same,  it would be disconcerting. If a male friend was like that with me- not  that I have one- it would definitely be something I’d be a little  worried by. That’s human. </span></em>Momomi sighed. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Shion, I know it was  you, and I appreciate the thought, but you haven’t made things any  easier at all. You’re just opening the same old wounds. But… what the  hell. I’m here now. I might as well do what I can, if only so I can go  to bed tonight knowing I did something. And as you’d put it, there’s no  such thing as too much information.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What are you brooding about now?” Kaname asked between mouthfuls.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why not guess for me?” Momomi teased. “Where’s the fun in things if I just tell you everything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you think I have the genius needed to penetrate your messed up skull, you’re mistaken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it wasn’t very important anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Whatever.” Kaname sighed. “So, I’ll be having your fish. What do you want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned, looking thoughtfully at Kaname. “Half your rice, and half your natto.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Huh? What’s with that? Can’t you just pick one or the other?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t want two of any one thing. Besides, I wouldn’t want to deny you  of any one thing, either.” Momomi smiled, leaning forwards slightly.  “It’s better this way, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “Why do you have to make everything so complicated?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pulled her friend’s rice towards her. “Why do you have to make such a fuss? You should learn to share.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I hope you haven’t forgotten that this whole thing is a big favour to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi took rice from Kaname’s bowl, even though there was plenty left in her own, mostly because she could. <em>It’s fun to screw around with her head, just a little. </em>“I’ll pay you back. But do you have to make such a fuss over the fact that you’re eating my fish?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  do you have to make such a fuss about fish?” Kaname demanded. “It’s  hardly logical in itself… you’re as difficult as always.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As are you. This is fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose I’ll just have to live with it, whether or not I find it fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  carried on eating, wondering how she could steer the conversation in a  useful direction. “Tell me, Kaname… did you have any childhood friends  or somesuch? I never was very clear on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rolled her  eyes. “What do you think? A poor person’s poor person in a poor area,  first the daughter of a disliked yakuza and then of an equally disliked  secretary of similar circumstances… and in myself, weird. No, I never  had anything like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No-one at all?” Momomi asked, slightly surprised. “Surely there must be someone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  shrugged. “I knew a lot of people. I hurt them and they hurt me,  physically, mentally and emotionally. I scraped by. But there was never  anyone who you’d really call a friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s pretty cruel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Life’s  pretty cruel. Well, in part I brought it upon myself. When people  dislike you the path of least resistance is to act cool, like you don’t  give a damn. And then they dislike you even more, and… well, you get  the idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “Childhood is a very idealised time of life, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  nodded. “I’ll say. People always think that just because they’re short,  they’re saints. But children can be some of the cruellest kinds of  people. I’ve always thought that’s a sort of reflection on what people  are really like, our natural state. It’s cliquey, competitive, with a  dominant leader and outsiders to be targeted. Quite the microcosm of  countries in this world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More of your philosophy. But I know what you mean; it is like that, isn’t it? There’s no such thing is innocence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged. “I wouldn’t say that. I’d say there is, and innocence is just ignorance of consequences. If that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re  far too cynical for our age. We must sound like two particularly  nihilistic old women, not teenage girls with our life ahead of us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smiled at that. “I’ll say. Does that make us naïve or mature before our time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just troubled, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I noticed that before, but the way you speak… you were the same?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blushed, realising that she’d let on more than she’d meant to. <em>As if Kaname doesn’t know anyway. </em>“I’m  pretty sure I’ve said before. I was almost locked at home, and educated  there, so I never really had any friends. Again, I had people I knew,  but I wouldn’t go so far as to call them friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smirked. “If that’s the case, surely you shouldn’t be too surprised over me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I <em>was </em>homeschooled. I’d imagined that you’d scraped by, as you had to come into contact with other people your age.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  be too fooled. I had to spent some time in a classroom with them. That  was it.” Kaname started eating her first fish, with a definite air that  she knew there was one more to come after this. “But you’re the one who  should be surprising me. I’m pretty inexperienced emotionally, I don’t  mind admitting that. But you’re always a lot more assured.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled, feeling conflicting emotions. <em>It’s amazing that </em>Kaname <em>can  bring herself to admit something like that to me. And it’s nice that I  look so assured, except for the fact that I’m not, not really. I  thought she was the assured one…</em>”Do I really come across that way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. You’re the one who does the whole people thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  funny, but I always saw you as the assured one. Because you don’t care  what people think about you, so you’re very confident.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname laughed. “So, either we’re both assured, or neither of us are assured. Let’s go for the former option, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “That sounds best. After all, if we can fool each other, it’s as good as true confidence, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll  probably know, but I wonder, is there even such a thing?” Kaname  frowned. “Does Kariya feel the same doubts as everyone else, but hides  them so well that no one can tell?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not sure. But it would  probably be nice if that was the case, wouldn’t it?” Momomi looked  across the table at her friend, ignoring the taste of the food she was  eating. That wasn’t important.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose that would be nice,”  Kaname agreed. “But there’s a difference, all the same. You’re my first  friend, I suppose. It’s embarrassing to say that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And even if I had sister, I’m your first friend as well.” <em>I  don’t like that word but I shouldn’t be surprised. No, I should just be  glad that I figure at all in her world. I can’t imagine what things  would be like if Kaname hated me. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname closed her eyes.  “God, that’s so embarrassing, isn’t it? We shouldn’t even be talking  about it… but now that we are, I’m totally blaming circumstances for  everything. It’s got nothing to do with us! It’s all the fault of our  surroundings, which isolated us, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s even true.” <em>Kaname’s  embarrassed face really is cute, and I’m sure I’m the only one who gets  to see it. She just scowls and glowers when other people embarrass her,  but she’s not so combative with me anymore. Of course, she’s still  Kaname, so…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s like… I don’t know… our isolation policy in  the Edo period, Sakoku. Faced with a hostile and potentially aggressive  world, in which all contact seems to be leading up the point of  military conquest, we have to choice but to limit contact with the  outside world. That’s the best way to protect our thoughts and feelings  and way of life and castles and stuff. So we keep everyone at arm’s  length on a island, if we see them at all, and only trade for useful  things like tea and gold and homework assignments we missed because we  were asleep in class. It’s a good defensive method, smart tactics.  Without intelligence and a grip on our culture and importance and  talents and interesting personalities, no one’s going to try and take  control of us or use us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed. “You know, that doesn’t  fully make sense. Sakoku was adopted as a result of internal pressures,  wasn’t it? Christian peasants being difficult, because of missionaries  from the outside world. So doesn’t that just mean we’re afraid of how  we might change as a result of the people around us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  looked surprised for a moment, then nodded. “Of course. That’s only  sensible, as Christian peasants are difficult, and having a stable  country and mind alike are both pretty useful. It’s better not to be  taken over, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’s hard to say whether that would  have happened, or not. People are complicated.” Momomi rested her head  on her right hand, feeling relaxed. “Of course, either way, the whole  thing was blown open by big gunboats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s you, isn’t it?”  Kaname replied easily, eating more of her fish. “When you kept arguing  with me and bugging me and sparring with me and snapping at me and who  knows what else, that’s definitely the show of force to break through  my defences. The carrot of your nicer moments comes later, when you’ve  opened trade and brought wealth and oranges and suchlike, but first you  smack a big stick around, just like in diplomacy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As ever, your  metaphors are entertaining. But I think this one falls down, because  far from being intimidated, the besieged Port Kaname pulled out its own  cannons and gave as good as it got in a massive artillery duel that  lasted over a month.” Momomi smiled and swallowed more rice. “Though if  that had happened in real life, history would have been a lot more  interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “No, it holds good in that I’ve  always wanted our history to be like that. Honestly, in an age where a  sword’s time is done, you can’t just sit behind your defensive veil and  hack each other up or even practise with blades. It’s time to work out  how to blow stuff up. Just like Kariya and kendo, it’s an art that is  after its time. There’s no point, you have to concentrate on getting  real weapons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I hope you’re not advocating the illegal possession of firearms,” Momomi chided. She watched her friend, eyes affectionate. <em>When  she’s like this, she’s… I don’t know…a wonderful person to be around.  Inventive and quick and smart and interesting, she always has something  funny to say, both from her own observations and from how she’s always,  always on her dignity, ready to change the story here or make up some  nonsense there to cloak the impression that she’s talking nonsense. But  it’s entertaining nonsense, and so confidently delivered that I don’t  care, it’s a lot more interesting than anything anyone normally ever  says to me. And her face is handsome and her eyes are bright and her  hair falls over her face like that, in that brilliant shade, she has a  something, a presence. I’m acutely aware of her existence, and I can’t  help but watch her. She’s beautiful and challenging and brilliant like  a star, but that doesn’t cover it. I could think about her for-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“…  so it’s the only thing to do. When people come knocking I let loose my  secret weapon, a personality I’ve honed for years, and sink their ships  and take the wind from their sails by puncturing them, until they’re  not enthusiastic enough to fight on. That’s what they should have done,  as well. Isolation should be a time to develop a stronger self. Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi blinked herself out of her trance. She resisted the urge to slap herself on the cheeks. <em>That would be too conspicuous. All the same…idiot, idiot! Kaname’s right, I’ll be writing mushy poetry any day now. </em>She  was blushing slightly, she knew, which must look odd. But Kaname didn’t  seem to have noticed. “Well, you’re right. But it can’t last forever, I  think. Countries may survive without trade, but they won’t really  thrive. At worst, they should be like seeds, preparing to bloom into  flowers the moment the time’s right.” <em>Not bad for a quick way to cover oneself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  suppose so,” Kaname conceded. “But sometimes it’s not internal change  you’re waiting for, but external change. When the temperature and  humidity and light intensity are just right, they can flower. That can  be difficult, especially for delicate flowers like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>It’s  not fair that she can make me feel like this. I want to be able to  complain to someone about it. Even though- no, especially because- I’m  still smiling. </em>“So, basically, you’re my sun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked embarrassed. “It’s sounds so weird when you put it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  it’s true,” Momomi said. “You were and are the right person, the right  conditions. I really am a delicate, picky flower who’s saying that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d  mock that, but I don’t really have any right to.” Kaname sighed. “This  is a slightly different topic, but what I meant when I said that you  were assured was that you really do understand people and emotions. If  you’re a delicate flower I’m a weed, tough and strong, but with any  subtlety. A long way from pretty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I think you’re pretty.” That  slipped out before Momomi’s brain really engaged, and then she  scrambled to cover herself. “Relative to others, it’s not just a matter  of softness and fragility. You’re a tough person, and that’s enough,  isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose it should be. But I do envy you. I don’t  feel like I have any emotional understanding… that’s why I was so  troubled back then. I can’t judge friendship, as you’re my first  friend, so I didn’t know what to make of anything.” Kaname looked  unusually melancholy. “And at the end of the day, I didn’t understand  anything at all, did I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re past that. We both made  mistakes.” Momomi shrugged. “And don’t be too jealous. I wish I was  less sensitive, because this empathy is a pain. I cry too easily and  even when I have something important to say, no one will take me  seriously, because of that. I want to be someone who can hide to  protect myself, but I can’t. So I really do envy your strength.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  laughed shortly. “Typical. That’s always the way, isn’t it? People  always want the characteristics they don’t have, because they don’t  have them. Well, provided we have one of each, it’s fine, I guess. I’ll  be your support, but I need you to tell me about the emotions of  others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>How can I be a brilliant empath when I can’t even understand my own feelings? </em>“Alright. But I don’t think I’m anywhere near as good as you make me out to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And don’t mind me if I screw up,” Kaname said. “This is my first time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Badly chosen phrase. </em>“With a friend, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname nodded. “It’s not like I’m nervous or anything, but I’ll get something wrong. Heck, you’re no different, so it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess so.” Momomi took a breath and decided to take a chance. “Say, Kaname, what kind of boys do you like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Say what?” Kaname demanded, startled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a simple question, isn’t it? If you don’t like girls, you must like boys. So what kind of boys do you like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What the hell kind of discussion is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  curious.” Momomi stuck out her tongue. “It’s reasonable enough, isn’t  it? Isn’t this what girls are supposed to talk about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  embarrassing,” Kaname said, glaring. “I’m definitely not going to be  drawn into such a shameful conversation for your convenience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not <em>your convenience</em>. I’m just making conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, have you ever told me what kind of girls you like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi felt her breath catch in her throat. “I don’t remember. Not specifically, I don’t think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname folded her arms. “Then I don’t have to answer either, do I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Come on, come on. This is a perfect chance. </em>“Do you want to know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. I’m curious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned. “You know, if I tell you, you’ll definitely be obliged to tell me what kind of boys you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll accept that. This is a big clue to the identity of your so-called cute girl that you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well…  I like taller girls. I’m not sure why, but I do. And I generally prefer  the more masculine ones, as well. I like short hair. I guess the more  female ones are nice to look at, but that’s not what I’d look for in a  girlfriend. I guess I really do need someone to hide behind, being as  emotionally vulnerable as I am. And…” Momomi took a breath, “they’d  have to be the same age as me. I’m not interested in a senpai-kohai  relationship, either way. I prefer romance to be kept between equals,  even if that’s old-fashioned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname frowned. “That so totally  sounds like Amane, you know, it’s unreal. I mean, if they ever took her  to a matchmaking session the in-laws would think they were being  conned…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re much the same, though, aren’t you? And I do like blue hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname looked at Momomi with surprise, her face change slightly as she went over her friend’s words again-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi broke. “What’s with the face?” she teased. “Are you the one thinking weird things now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname blushed. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi just looked amused, flicking a strand of her hair away. “You’re way too easy to tease.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Idiot!  Idiot! Idiot! I should commit seppuku now and save myself the worry,  because I’ve only made things more difficult for myself. What the hell  was that? Talk about cowardice…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You really shouldn’t joke about things like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sorry,  Kaname,” Momomi said, keeping her smile somehow. It was pretty fake and  she hoped her friend couldn’t notice. Well, Kaname was a self-declared  idiot when it came to emotions, she should be okay. “You’re just so  cute when you blush that there’s no way I can resist.” <em>Now I’m just contradicting myself, but it’s not like I’ve given myself any choice.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  as playful as ever,” Kaname noted. “I’ll forgive you, but only because  this is your celebration. Otherwise there would definitely be hell to  pay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted. “I’m sorry, already. You’re still a drama  queen, and all… in any case, you owe me now. Tell me what kind of boys  you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, even if you ask I don’t have an answer.” Kaname folded her arms. “Its not like I know very many boys, now do I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, come on. You have an imagination, right?” Momomi teased. “You don’t <em>have </em>to be gay at Astraea. Picture the kind of guy you like. Visualise! Visualise!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  rolled her eyes. “How embarrassing. I’m not really interested in that  kind of stuff anyway. I’m still young, and it’s all a waste of time as  it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So Kaname hasn’t reached puberty yet. Well, that figures.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  not it!” Kaname flushed hotly. “Seriously, though, you have to admit,  nothing could be further from my relevant existence. I probably won’t  be in such a situation until university.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, come on. You’re being boring. Even if you have to make something up… I gave my opinion, so be fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Your opinion was entirely made up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  not true. It was mostly accurate, actually.” Momomi leaned forwards.  “Now, spill it. Even if you have to make it up. What type? A tall,  strong bad boy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shuddered. “Don’t make me sick. I hate that kind of person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then  what?” Momomi pressed. Kaname’s free hand was actually tracing little  circles on the table out of embarrassment, which is strangely  delightful. “It’s not like I’ll laugh at you or anything. I’m in no  position to laugh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I told you, I don’t know! I don’t think  about this stuff…” Kaname strengthened herself on that thought, shaking  her head. “I mean, really, isn’t it just a waste of time and effort?  It’s about biology, this conversation shows that, but people make it  all so needlessly complicated…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“An unusual opinion to hear from  such a prude.” Momomi smiled. “Maybe it is just as well you don’t know  any guys, it sounds like you’d be horribly promiscuous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  flushed but stood her ground. “That’s why I have no interest in it,  it’s very primitive and disgusting. But people talk it up in all sorts  of protracted ways and make a ritual of it… I just wouldn’t bother  altogether.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I think it’s more complex than you think. There’s  more than just physical attraction to… say, well, the Etoiles, for  example. I can’t say I understand it, I mean, I’m thirteen…” Momomi  tried to gather her thoughts. “But there’s something there to  understand. Don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps,” Kaname conceded. “But I can’t shake the feeling that it’s all so much work and pain. Look at them with your parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, aren’t we the same?” Momomi looked away. “We had to struggle with my parents as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They won’t be able to rest though. They’ll always have problems…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  that’s not love, that’s homosexual love, isn’t it? You have it a lot  easier.” Momomi sighed, deflating slightly. “Sorry. That wasn’t called  for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I don’t know anything complicated. But it’s all a  little little beyond me, and so I don’t bother to think about it.  That’s all, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What would you do…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi sighed. “What would you do if you thought you liked someone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I definitely wouldn’t screw around. I’d tell them. I told you before, I hate wishy-washy people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  what sounds most dramatic,” Kaname said with a smile. “But in reality,  I doubt I’d find it that easy. I’m so emotionally stunted I’d have a  very hard time of it in reality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi collected herself. “You’re still dodging the question, though, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re annoyingly persistent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  annoyingly evasive. Come on, Kaname, at least you don’t have to  describe the perversion of liking other girls out loud. You have it  easy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, around here, you seem to be the normal one, if you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, Astraea isn’t the world. Don’t be too jealous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright, sore subject. I get it.” Kaname shrugged. “Well, I don’t know… I really don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I won’t drop the subject. Just make something up to tell me, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why are you so interested, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  a girl thing.” Momomi smiled, feeling a little daring. “I want to know  the kind of person I’ll be losing my Kaname-kun to.” <em>God, I’m  fricking bipolar about this, aren’t I? Manic depressive indeed…I know I  feel like a melancholy maniac whenever I look at her now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not  much chance of that around here,” Kaname noted. “But… I don’t know. I  guess- though it’s embarrassing to say- a more retiring kind of guy. I  don’t like being pushed anywhere, I’d want to be in control.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  giggled. “You say that, but aren’t you the emotionally stunted one?  Surely you’ll need a guy to sweep you off your feet to make you realise  your feelings?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I knew you’d laugh at me,” Kaname said sulkily.  “But I suppose you have a point. In any case, I wouldn’t mind being  taller than him. And I don’t like muscular guys, to be honest. Long  hair’s quite nice…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname’s into bishies,” Momomi concluded,  covering her lips with her hand under the guise of leaning on it. “I  guess you really do always want to be the man in a relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“God, don’t sound too much like someone who’s raided Serané’s shoujo manga collection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even  so, I doubt many such people exist in reality. That must be troublesome  for you… though I’m in the same position.” Momomi gave her friend a  teasing look. “If you want an effete guy, isn’t it easier to just fall  for a girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You make that sound so simple. If you like butch girls, why not fall for a guy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because if there’s a mannish girl in front of me, I probably won’t have to look around too far.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I won’t speculate on that. In any case, that’s your answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thanks.” <em>I’m still not sure why I asked…it must be the masochist in me. And what to make of her answer? Well, Kaname’s always Kaname. </em>Momomi looked around, blushing and wondering whether anyone had listened in on their extremely private conversation. <em>When  I think about it, this totally wasn’t the place and time. Can’t let  Kaname notice that, though, or she’ll crucify me. Even if it wouldn’t  be bad to die seeing her embarrassed face, all in all, I’d rather live. </em>“Hmm… how about Araldo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname almost choked on her soup. “Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  don’t get more reserved and polite guys like him. Sure, he might try  and talk big as if he knows something about people like me, but he  folds the moment you talk back. And he’s pretty, isn’t he?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“God, know. Don’t try to set me up with your cousin, that’s just weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not trying to set you up,” Momomi said reproachfully. “I’m just commenting. Well, how about it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“God no. He’s like three years older than me, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So that’s a factor for you as well…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not like I’d mind a small difference, but dude. I’m barely legal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In Italy… no, actually, it might barely be legal if he’s less than three years older.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Have you made a study of those laws? Don’t think about it too much.” Kaname made a face. “You’re making me feel ill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  raised the subject,” Momomi pointed out. “But when you’ve got nothing  to do but study, you study all sorts of different things. Including  things your tutors may not have intended.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Unpleasant mental images.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I was referring to the state of sexual laws world-wide. I don’t know what it is you’re muttering about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case… no one like Araldo. I mean, he has nice yes, I guess, but  that’s about it. I don’t like totally wet, submissive guys any more  than I’d like guys who think they’re so cool and always in control of  the situation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose you don’t know any boys, though. Just like you said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged. “Well, I know the type of person I like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Based on the people you know? I suppose us poor girls can serve as guides…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wonder what a male you would be like,” Kaname said. “Somehow, I can’t imagine it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m hurt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“However I look at it, you’re the doll-like girl’s girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you’re one operation short of being a guy, so don’t get too uppity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “Whatever. We’re finished.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked down. “We’re finished,” she echoed. <em>What  a waste. I ate all that food without even tasting it. Heck, I may even  have eaten fish without noticing. If I throw up later, I’ll be able to  guess later. </em>She pulled out her money before Kaname could say anything, and raised a hand. “Do you have change for this, please?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t even think about paying for me,” Kaname muttered angrily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hey,  don’t enforce your stereotypes on me,” Momomi said in a bored voice.  “Just because you’re the alpha male, that doesn’t mean you get to pay  for everything. This is the modern world, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course I’m not paying for you, but I can damn well pay for myself…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Let  me be a spoiled brat.” Momomi closed her eyes and pouted. “If you like,  I can owe you a favour. But I’m not going to have any chances to spend  this after today, so I’m determined to waste it now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname growled. “It pisses me off when you act like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  your pride is annoying as well,” Momomi snapped back. “There’s pride  and then there’s stupidity. Don’t mistake this for charity, because I  wouldn’t do that. Calling it charity is just the whiny pride of the  poor who don’t have anything to hold onto but their pride, and you’re  not that pathetic yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “You’re pretty blunt,  aren’t you? As arrogant as ever. Well, I guess I should expect that of  a rich brat like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, yeah. Call me what you like, I  could care less. I’m just taking a leaf out of your book.” Momomi  scowled. “When I do something stupid, you don’t mince your words, you  tell me how it is. This is the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that would make sense if you understood. But you’ve never wanted for anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  mean you always understand? You’re the self-proclaimed emotionally  stunted one, that’s how you deal with the things you don’t understand!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I always understand enough,” Kaname retorted. “That you need to stop being a damn idiot!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And that’s my position on you right now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Arrogant <em>and</em> self-righteous!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  my line!” Momomi snatched the change without looking. She had intended  to tip the man, but now she was almost too pissed off to care. She  threw a few notes down and stalked out with Kaname, bickering as she  went.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Does she always have to be so…so stuck up? Can’t she  just accept something from me without questioning it? That’s all I  want, because I know myself. I have so much I want to give her, but it  will always be this. Or worse than this. It makes me want to write  angsty poetry after all.</em></span></p>
