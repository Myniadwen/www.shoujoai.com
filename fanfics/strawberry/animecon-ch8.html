<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 8 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ninemil.html">ninemil</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&quot;Well, there&#39;s your answer,&quot; Chikaru commented, staring at the pale blue 
Etoile stone lying on the council chamber table, the light in the 
ceiling above reflecting on the smooth sapphire surface as it rocked 
back and forth gently where Shion had placed it.

The pretty Lulim girl sighed, and looked at her colleagues either side 
of her, sitting back in her chair in disappointment. Shion hung her 
head, feeling ashamed and thoroughly embarrassed. Her entire career at 
Spica had revolved around the day she would lead an Etoile from Spica to 
the Astrea Cathedral. Having succeeded, here she was only to see the 
pair concede the position a mere week later. She felt like a failure, 
kicking herself for placing her trust so completely in Amane. Surely if 
she&#39;d looked harder she would have seen this coming. Kaname and Momomi 
had been right all along.

Uncharacteristically, Miyuki remained completely silent, her dark eyes 
shining as the three girls waited for Sister Mizue to arrive. The 
thoughtful sixth year held in her hand a rolled up parchment tied neatly 
with a green Miator ribbon, a source of intrigue for Chikaru who hadn&#39;t 
been aware of any presentations being scheduled for the morning meeting. 
After all, they&#39;d not had breakfast yet, so surely it couldn&#39;t be 
anything time consuming. Meetings with the Sister present took long 
enough as it was, their heightened formality dragging everything out.

The heavy wooden doors swung wide as the intimidating figure of the 
Dormitory administrator strode into the room, the three girls standing 
and bowing politely,

&quot;Good morning Sister,&quot; they chimed.

&quot;Good morning Council. I trust you have something for me to take to the 
staff today?&quot; the grey haired woman asked, her tone it&#39;s usual coarse 
self.

Shion gestured at the table, and she hung her head as she replied,

&quot;Ohtori-san has also relinquished her position, stating she is unable to 
continue alone in Konohana-san&#39;s absence from Astrea. Spica apologizes 
for failing its sister establishments.&quot;

The Sister regarded the fifth year in dismay, replying in a troubled 
tone,

&quot;Astrea accepts the President&#39;s apology. This chain of events wasn&#39;t 
easily predicted, despite the careful vetting the staff gives to the 
prospective Etoile candidates before the election process begins. Spica 
should feel no shame as a result, no could have seen this coming.&quot;

She wrapped her finger nails across the table top in thought, 
considering the intricate pendant as it lay on the polished surface 
before her. Looking for inspiration, she asked,

&quot;Immediate suggestions?&quot;

Miyuki nodded at the Sister, and Mizue motioned for her to share,

&quot;I see two prospective solutions, both temporary measures until 
Konohana-san&#39;s return in January.&quot;

&quot;Please elaborate Rokujo-san,&quot; the old woman replied.

&quot;Firstly, we have the option of reinstating the former-Etoile as a - &quot;

Sister Mizue cut Miyuki off with a curt rejection,

&quot;Unacceptable to the staff. Your other suggestion?&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s eyes glittered as she motioned with her free hand,

&quot;Everyone in this room knows the true result of the Etoile election. 
Were it not for Hanazono-san&#39;s theatrics, it would not have been Spica 
crowning an Etoile this year.&quot;

Miyuki paused, allowing the words to sink in,

&quot;I put it to the council that we instate Aoi-san and Suzumi-san in the 
interim, using the former-Etoile as a guide to get the job done 
efficiently until something permanent can be discussed for the new term. 
It should sit well with the students that voted for them, and give 
Hanazono-san the chance to repay her debt to the school for her 
disruptive behaviour.&quot;

The old woman looked at Miyuki, considering the motion. Chikaru had 
tipped her head, nodding silently as she played the idea over as well, 
noting the huge potential for ulterior motive from the Miatorian 
President, but recognizing the common sense in the suggestion at the 
same time.

Things had played perfectly into Miyuki&#39;s hands she thought.

Shion remained silent, her head hung low and her eyes on the floor. She 
would have nothing to do with this discussion she decided, her pride and 
her choices having created the problem they were now attempting to fix.

Sister Mizue nodded in satisfaction, then proclaimed,

&quot;I&#39;ll put it to the staff, although I see no problem with the motion as 
it stands. Both girls were vetted extensively, especially Aoi-san given 
her relative unfamiliarity with the school system, and both performed 
extremely well in the Election process.&quot;

She turned to Miyuki,

&quot;See that they&#39;re both present in the council chambers after the evening 
meal. I&#39;ll return with the school&#39;s decision then. Are there any other 
matters of business before I leave?&quot;

Miyuki nodded,

&quot;Just one Sister; I would like to present Miator&#39;s bid for the Christmas 
Ball. I would also ask that Spica present theirs. Since Lulim held last 
year&#39;s Ball, they are ineligible to hold the event this year. I believe 
it would be sensible to move on this now while you are here to offer 
guidance, since we are fast running out of time and I don&#39;t feel we can 
wait until the Etoile&#39;s replacements have settled in.&quot;

The Sister looked to Shion,

&quot;Can Spica outline its proposition Tomori-san?&quot;

The blonde sixth year bowed her head again, mumbling quietly,

&quot;With events surrounding Hikari&#39;s departure and the time spent locating 
Amane, I - &quot;

The grey haired woman cut in,

&quot;Has Spica prepared a presentation Tomori-san?&quot; she demanded again.

Shion shook her head, sullen and subdued.

&quot;No Sister, we have not.&quot;

&quot;Miyuki,&quot; the Sister motioned, and the dark haired Miatorian pulled the 
green ribbon loose and unfurled the parchment across the table, 
revealing a carefully drawn floor layout covered with annotations and 
notes. She had gone to great detail Chikaru noticed, already having 
included the d&eacute;cor, the layout of the head table, the letter head on the 
flyers, even the colour of the balloons. Chikaru was impressed, although 
somehow, looking at the plan she felt a spark of recognition, but 
couldn&#39;t place it.

Sister Mizue nodded, carefully studying the document, taking in the 
financial estimates and the seating plans. She looked at the sixth year, 
impressed by the amount of work she&#39;d done.

&quot;This is very detailed Miyuki; excellent work.&quot;

She frowned as she read further, then asked,

&quot;And you can corroborate these financial estimates?&quot;

The Miatorian nodded,

&quot;I have written quotes ready for assessment Sister.&quot;

The old woman cut in,

&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary. Since Spica is unprepared and time is running 
short, we move on Miator&#39;s bid.&quot;

And with that, she nodded politely to the three girls and took her 
leave, striding down the corridor towards her office.

Watching the Sister go, Chikaru caught Miyuki smiling to herself.

- - - - -

Chiyo raised a closed hand to the door in front of here for the fifth 
time, and for the fifth time in succession, she dropped it again, unable 
to go through with knocking it.

She&#39;d already tried this the night before, only to have panicked and 
left the corridor when some of the older Lulim girls had appeared on the 
way to their Dormitories on the level above. Chiyo had spent several 
minutes before that attempting to pluck enough courage up to face 
Kagome, but had failed then too.

She simply had no idea how to approach the conversation, and her little 
heart sank as she realised she still had no idea now either. What was 
she going to do, casually stroll up and apologise for emotionally 
scaring the Lulim first year for life?

She sighed, and fiddling with the front of her uniform skirt, she bowed 
her head. If only she were strong and confident like her one-sama; she&#39;d 
know how to handle this.

Then to her surprise, a loud click came from the door in front of her, 
and the handle started turning. Her face went bright red and she looked 
side to side for an escape route, her blue eyes wide in panic. But 
before she&#39;d managed to convince her little legs to move the door swung 
wide open, and Kagome&#39;s pretty face stared at the Miatorian before her.

&quot;Chiyo-chan?&quot; she asked in her small voice.

Chiyo scratched the back of her head nervously, and looked about in a 
distracted fashion.

&quot;Hello Kagome-san. I was about to knock...&quot;

Kagome looked at the other first year with her usual startling gaze, her 
deep green eyes seeing straight through the Miatorian as though she were 
looking directly into the other girl&#39;s soul. Chiyo shivered, hating the 
way the Lulim girl did that.

&quot;But you&#39;ve been outside Kagome-chan&#39;s door since she finished drying 
her hair.&quot;

Chiyo baulked, and dipped her head in shame. Shuffling her foot briefly, 
she looked up and with a pensive expression she replied,

&quot;I came to apologise to Kagome-san, but didn&#39;t know how to say it.&quot;

Kagome looked at Miatorian, her expression unchanged. It was then that 
Chiyo realised the Lulim girl, stood in her checked uniform ready for 
breakfast, was without her teddy bear.

Her heart sinking, Chiyo asked in a small voice,

&quot;Where is Ohshibaru Kagome-san?&quot;

Kagome stared back, her brown curls framing her face,

&quot;Ohshibaru has gone away, Kagome-chan is going to school without him 
now.&quot;

Chiyo felt the pang of guilt, wondering how much damage she&#39;d done to 
the bear in her fit of rage.

&quot;Is he okay Kagome-san?&quot; she asked meekly,

Kagome looked at the Miatorian with bemused eyes, replying in a 
matter-of-fact tone,

&quot;He&#39;s a stuffed toy Chiyo-chan, why wouldn&#39;t he be?&quot; And with that, she 
took the other first year by the hand.

&quot;Why are you using Kagome-san? Do you not like Kagome-chan anymore?&quot;

Chiyo looked stunned,

&quot;You should go to breakfast now Chiyo-chan, it&#39;s almost time for the 
prayer and Chikaru-senpai is giving it; Kagome-chan would like to be on 
time as Chikaru-senpai has been very good to Kagome-chan of late.&quot;

And as she closed her bedroom door with her other hand, Kagome dragged 
the bewildered Miatorian down the corridor towards the breakfast hall.

Tamao sat alone in the lounge, curled up in the corner of one of the 
long beige sofas, her shoes arranged neatly on the floor before her, the 
fourth year&#39;s legs gathered beneath her long Miatorian dress. In the 
upperclassman&#39;s lap lay her trusty cerulean poetry jotter, the book left 
open at a blank page, the parchment still pristine and unmarred. In her 
right hand, hanging idle in the vast expanse around her was the black 
resin fountain pen she always used when writing, the glinting gold nib 
still yet to strike the page.

The dark haired girl sat statue still, her deep blue eyes lost 
somewhere, her mind slowly retracing the previous evening&#39;s encounter 
with her fellow upperclassman.

Over and over the scene played; the look in Nagisa&#39;s eyes, the warmth of 
her skin, the sound of their breathing falling into rhythm, the 
uncomfortable subtext in Nagisa&#39;s voice.

The sudden immediacy of it all, the marked shift in tone.

She&#39;d push the thoughts from her mind, trying to form the beginnings of 
her next piece for Literature club, only to find her subconscious 
undermining her, returning to the same point and clouding her mind like 
a fine mist waiting to be chased off by the morning sun.

She&#39;d come to the lounge to escape, to find some respite from the 
suffocating noise in the Dormitory. There were so many triggers there; 
the smell of Nagisa&#39;s perfume, her untouched bed, the red head&#39;s pretty 
pink pyjama&#39;s folded neatly atop her pillow, the soft linen garments 
commanding Tamao&#39;s attention from the corner of her peripheral vision.

Everywhere she&#39;d looked in that room, the same memory sprang back, her 
skin tingling, her face flushed and her stomach knotting with an 
underlying guilt.

She&#39;d come to the lounge to escape.

And yet even here, she realised, the loaded nib still swimming in the 
void around her, as far from the red head&#39;s presence as she could get 
without stepping into the cold wind outside, those words and feelings 
still plagued her mind.

Pen left idle, her usual inner place of literature-consumed solace 
unreachable, Tamao sighed as she looked down at the blank page before 
her.

&quot;I can&#39;t...&quot;

- - - - -

Nagisa shivered in the frosty air, rubbing her arms and stomping her 
feet as they waited for the traffic to stop so they could cross the road 
leaving the station. The sun was high in the afternoon sky, its rays 
struggling in the cool winter air, and as the girls breathed, it left 
warm trails floating around them. The couple had left Astrea not long 
after lessons had finished for the day, Shizuma having kept to her word 
that she&#39;d take Nagisa to visit the illusive figure she&#39;d spoken of the 
previous afternoon.

The area they travelled to was near the school, only thirty minutes away 
on the train despite the girls riding during peak hours. When the pair 
had stepped through the station exit, Nagisa found herself looking at 
rural suburbia, the streets lined by dainty detached housing, each 
building sporting its own garden and a token willow tree, along with the 
usual shrubbery and painted garage door. Between the domestic looking 
cars parked on each drive way and the young children playing ball or 
chasing each other around, it reminded Nagisa of something from an 
American television show, all idyllic and serene looking.

She gazed around, wondering in curiosity what kind of woman could be so 
inspiring to her tempestuous girlfriend when they lived in a place as 
ordinary looking as this.

The girls had changed out of their uniforms as they were travelling 
during school hours, Shizuma looking comfy in a long brown skirt, knee 
high leather boots and a fluffy grey jumper with a ruffled cowl neck, 
topped off with her black cashmere overcoat. Nagisa wore a pastel dress 
and her long woollen wrap, regretting the thin cloth the dress was made 
of in the icy breeze. The girls chatted as they walked to their 
destination, Shizuma having explained it wasn&#39;t far from the train 
station.

&quot;So the woman I&#39;m going to introduce you to has been an inspiration for 
me since Kaori&#39;s death,&quot; Shizuma started, &quot;She helped me realise that 
there was nothing wrong or obscene about the relationship I&#39;d been in, 
at a time when my mourning was over shadowed by my inability to express 
it openly.&quot;

She sighed as she added,

&quot;It was difficult for me; I loved Kaori-san deeply, but very few of the 
girls at the school knew how involved we actually were, and certainly 
there were no adults, no one on staff that I could confide in about it. 
I&#39;d have been kicked out of the school just for muttering a hint of the 
things we&#39;d done together.&quot;

Shizuma smiled fondly, her mischievous side reflecting on the many 
visits to the Sister&#39;s office having been caught breaking curfew or 
organizing late night meetings.

&quot;So while I was in my loneliest of places, in my deepest of depressions 
this woman confided in me about her own past and a present that until 
that point, she&#39;d kept well hidden from me and most of the other people 
that knew her. Even now there are people she works with every day of her 
life that would drop dead with shock if they knew she had another woman 
as a lover.&quot;

Shizuma pulled her coat tighter around her as the wind picked up, 
continuing the story,

&quot;Through her story I came to see my relationship with Kaori in a 
different light, and although it didn&#39;t necessarily make dealing with 
the pain of losing her any easier, it allowed me to understand myself a 
lot more.&quot;

Nagisa tried to imagine someone so understanding and empathetic, 
struggling to picture a woman that could understand another&#39;s feelings 
so clearly and that was prepared to divulge their own secrets so 
trustingly to help a friend&#39;s pain. Amazed, she listened intently as the 
story developed,

&quot;She&#39;s a lot like us, having lived a very similar life when she was our 
age.&quot;

Nagisa fiddled with her lose red locks which Shizuma had insisted she 
left down for a change,

&quot;She studied at Miator just like us, and then went on to a place at 
University where she found herself developing a relationship with the 
European student she shared a room with. Over the four years they were 
at the University together, the two girls became closer and closer, 
finding more and more in common, building a true relationship around the 
drunken night that had started them down their path together. They moved 
into their own flat during the second year, living like husband and 
wife, studying together, sleeping together, paying the bills and buying 
their shopping like an average couple. For those four years, they were 
blissfully happy.&quot;

Then Shizuma&#39;s smile diminished slightly, her story telling mixed with 
her own fears for the future,

&quot;Then came graduation and everything changed; her girlfriend had to 
return to her own country, and as her parents had planned, the woman was 
forced into an arranged marriage, moving into their new marital home, 
from where the married couple continued the husband&#39;s family business, 
working as a research funding organization whilst raising their first 
born child. Although the woman was happy with what she&#39;d gained and 
loved their little daughter dearly, inwardly she was desperately lonely 
and longed for her girlfriend&#39;s lost companionship.&quot;

Nagisa was sullen at this turn in the story, and listened hopeful that 
events would change again.

&quot;And that was her world for the next six years until she turned thirty. 
Then, at her birthday party, she ran into her girlfriend from University 
again. The actual meeting at the party was awkward, neither knowing 
really what to say to each other. But they traded contact details, and 
as time went on, they slowly resumed communication, sending emails and 
private phone calls when they had the opportunity.&quot;

Shizuma stopped Nagisa as the younger girl almost walked straight out 
into the middle of a busy interchange, and she smiled at the fourth year 
for being so swept up by the former-Etoile&#39;s tale. Waiting for the road 
to clear, they crossed, and then the older girl continued,

&quot;Eventually they arranged to meet in secret, and after that night 
together, they restarted their relationship. They began seeing each 
other more and more often, and eventually things became awkward when the 
woman&#39;s husband became suspicious. One night he followed his wife and 
caught the women together. Things became so inhospitable at home 
afterwards that the woman had to send her daughter away to boarding 
school in the fear that if she didn&#39;t, the young girl would suffer from 
watching her parents fight night after night.&quot;

Shizuma seemed subdued as she recounted this part of the tale,

&quot;The woman started staying away from the martial home for longer and 
longer periods of time, until eventually the husband&#39;s attitude began to 
change. He realised that he was unable to change his wife&#39;s nature and 
unable to face the shame of divorce and fearing for the successful 
family corporation they&#39;d built together, along with their daughter&#39;s 
emotional well being, the couple eventually came to a compromise; the 
husband and wife continuing to work together, raising their daughter as 
any other family would, portraying a normal, happy existence to the 
world around them while the husband arranged for his wife to live with 
her girlfriend in secret when she had the chance to get away. Inwardly, 
the husband still very much loved his wife, and over time came to terms 
with what she was. The woman in return came to respect her husband for 
his understanding, and they rediscovered their relationship as that of 
two close friends, working towards a common set of goals. Since then, 
their corporation has raised large sums of money for cancer research, 
and their daughter is one of the most promising students at her school, 
with a healthy career ahead of her when she leaves University.&quot;

Shizuma ushered Nagisa to the left at as they crossed another junction, 
the wind rustling through the bowing trees above them,

&quot;The woman and her girlfriend have, in the mean time, lived together 
happily for over eleven years now, continuing their cosy life from 
University in the house that I&#39;m taking you to.&quot;

Nagisa was dumbstruck, not aware that such things could go on in the 
world, unable to comprehend the ability to fool everyone around the 
married couple so well. She pondered the thought as Shizuma directed 
Nagisa a short way along the cul-de-sac they&#39;d turned into, before 
motioning her up a long paved driveway in front of her.

&quot;Until this woman told me her story, I&#39;d considered her the same as 
anyone else I knew, completely unaware of her secret life with her 
girlfriend. As I got to know them together as a couple, I realised that 
they were just like anyone else, and realised that Kaori and I hadn&#39;t 
been any different either. I knew then that I didn&#39;t need to hide my 
grief, that there wasn&#39;t anything wrong about the feelings I&#39;d had for 
her. And through that woman&#39;s story, I came to terms with what I was and 
learnt to move forward.&quot;

Shizuma sighed, a heavy feeling playing on her heart.

&quot;Don&#39;t misunderstand, it didn&#39;t stop me missing Kaori, and it didn&#39;t 
stop the desperate loneliness, but at least I was able to express those 
feelings finally.&quot;

Sympathy in her eyes, Nagisa looked pensively at Shizuma as they passed 
neatly arranged flower beds and shrubs on either side of the winding 
drive way,

&quot;She sounds like a truly amazing woman,&quot; Nagisa said, awestruck by the 
story. Then it suddenly dawned on her that it was time to stop walking; 
the girls standing directly outside the house at the end of the drive 
that Shizuma had directed them up.

The building before them was a cosy looking bungalow, set further back 
from the road than the other neighbouring houses, with a huge front 
garden and a well kept lawn. The house had a front veranda with a 
hanging sofa, cute french shutters, pretty lace curtains and a large 
looking back garden hidden by a high hedge that ran around it, skirting 
the garage wall to the right.

Shizuma smiled, her emerald eyes gleaming as she rang the door bell,

&quot;She is,&quot; she replied.

And after a moment&#39;s pause, a shadowy figure appeared through the 
frosted glass, walking toward the door. Nagisa swallowed nervously, and 
as the door sung open, Shizuma beamed,

&quot;Nagisa Aoi, I&#39;d like you to meet my mother, Mina Hanazono.&quot;

- - - - -

Nagisa stood in the doorway in shock for a moment, before realising that 
her jaw was hanging wide open, promptly clamping it tightly shut. She 
bowed politely, looking at the woman before her in awe.

Shizuma&#39;s mother returned the bow with a gentle nod, and then welcomed 
the fourth year with a soft voice,

&quot;You must be Nagisa,&quot; Mina smiled, &quot;It&#39;s wonderful to finally meet you. 
Please, come in.&quot;

The woman stepped back as she ushered the two girls into the hallway, 
Shizuma kissing her mother on the cheek gently as she passed. The 
former-Etoile slipped off her overcoat and motioned for Nagisa to hand 
over her wrap, before disappearing into the house beyond to hang them.

Acutely aware of her appearance before a member of Shizuma&#39;s family, 
Nagisa straightened her dress out, fiddling with her loose hair 
nervously.

Mina watched the red head, smiling warmly at the fourth year,

&quot;You look perfectly radiant Nagisa, relax,&quot; she said, prompting the 
fourth year to blush in embarrassment. Mina chuckled pleasantly and 
turned as her daughter reappeared.

&quot;I&#39;ve left them in the spare bedroom Mother.&quot;

Mina nodded and embraced her daughter lovingly,

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you,&quot; she said, returning the kiss before leading the 
two girls into the kitchen.

&quot;How was the trip?&quot; she asked, walking across the warmly lit room, 
rounding the counter to fill a kettle from the sink located under a wide 
window behind the wooden panelled work surface. The kitchen had a homely 
rustic feel to it, and Nagisa could smell pastry of some sort baking in 
the oven.

Shizuma shrugged as she ran her fingers idly over the black marble 
counter, before perching on one of the breakfast bar stools,

&quot;Same as usual; crammed trains and lots of stuffy looking business men 
giving us odd looks.&quot;

Mina laughed, putting the kettle on to boil before turning to face the 
couple.

&quot;That&#39;s no surprise; two young women as beautiful as yourselves should 
turn heads.&quot;

She regarded Nagisa directly, the red head standing at the counter 
feeling awkward. She was stunned at how informal Shizuma and her mother 
were around each other, but manners dictated that she didn&#39;t behave the 
same way, and unsure of how to act, she stood silent, waiting to be 
addressed.

Shizuma and her mother bore a startling resemblance; the older woman 
having the same distinct hair colour as the Miatorian, although she wore 
hers at shoulder length and without the fringe, instead sporting a 
central parting with her silver hair falling lose, framing her pretty 
face. Her features carried the same elegant grace as her daughter, with 
high cheeky bones, sparkling blue eyes and the same slim figure. Were 
the observer in a dimly lit room with the two Hanazono women, they could 
be excused for confusing the pair as sisters. Up close however, Mina&#39;s 
face was criss-crossed with the fine lines of age, her eyes carrying the 
knowing sparkle of a lifetime&#39;s experience and wisdom.

Mina smiled back at the red head regarding her,

&quot;I take it from the petrified look on your face that Shizuma didn&#39;t tell 
you who she was taking you to meet today?&quot; She grinned at her daughter 
with playful eyes before remarking,

&quot;You&#39;ve scared the poor girl half to death.&quot;

Shizuma smiled coyly before wrapping her arms around Nagisa&#39;s shoulders 
from behind, squeezing her gently and whispering into the fourth year&#39;s 
ear,

&quot;Relax Nagisa, you&#39;re not in front of Sister Mizue now.&quot;

Mina chuckled and shot back,

&quot;I would like to think I don&#39;t compare easily to that old hag no.&quot;

Nagisa blushed again, and stammered,

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry Mrs Hanazono; I&#39;m just a little stunned.&quot; She turned 
to Shizuma, adding &quot;I had no idea you were talking about your Mother 
earlier. I&#39;m awe struck.&quot;

The kettle announced it was ready with a loud click, and Mina turned to 
deal with it,

&quot;Can you pass me some cups honey,&quot; she asked, pointing her daughter to 
one of the wall cupboards near Shizuma&#39;s head. The former-Etoile 
reciprocated, passing the china piece by piece to her mother over the 
counter,

&quot;So you&#39;ve been telling tales on me have you Shizuma?&quot; the woman asked, 
and Shizuma replied with a wry smile,

&quot;Something like that Mother. Nagisa is struggling with the world a 
little at the moment. I thought spending some time with some normal 
people might help.&quot;

Mina glanced side ways and grinned knowingly as she prepared the teapot, 
pushing her falling hair back behind her ears,

&quot;As normal as you could call anyone I guess.&quot; She replied, shaking a 
packet of tea leaves before tearing it open and adding it to the pot,

&quot;Well, Emmie&#39;s out getting some things we need for lunch at the moment; 
she&#39;ll be back shortly so you&#39;ll get to meet her then.&quot;

Nagisa felt a little awkward at the mention of the woman she presumed 
was Mina&#39;s lover, but smiled all the same. It felt weird knowing that 
Shizuma&#39;s mother was with another woman; yet also very reassuring at the 
same time and the fourth year took a deep breath whilst trying to settle 
her nerves.

&quot;On the way here Shizuma told me a little about how you&#39;d helped her 
after Kaori-san&#39;s funeral,&quot; Nagisa said, bowing her eyes politely as she 
continued, &quot;I really admire the way you did that. I wish I could talk to 
my Mother about my feelings in the same way.&quot;

Mina looked up from the tea pot for a second, trading a glance with her 
daughter before responding,

&quot;Grief is a powerful emotion Nagisa; it can do horrible things if you 
don&#39;t deal with it properly.&quot; She looked lovingly at the sixth year 
across the room, &quot;A mother knows when her daughter is in pain, I just 
did what I needed to do in order to help her deal with that.&quot;

She considered something briefly, then added,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for your situation, I know how that feels all too well. I 
could never talk to my mother about Emmie either.&quot;

Finishing up with the tea pot, she lifted a tray with everything on and 
asked,

&quot;Shall we go somewhere more comfortable?&quot;

The girls followed Mina through from the kitchen to an open plan living 
room that overlooked the back garden through sweeping patio doors. It 
was filled with two cosy looking sofas, an expensive looking dining 
table and chairs, an entertainment centre and a black grand piano in the 
corner. The walls were covered in framed photographs featuring a 
black-suited Mina, a well dressed gentleman and various other people, 
some of which Nagisa recognised from the television and media. The vast 
majority of the pictures however were of Shizuma, Mina and a European 
looking woman with long brown hair. Mina motioned to one of the larger 
photos as she put the tray down on a coffee table located between the 
two sofas, remarking,

&quot;That&#39;s Emmie in the middle.&quot;

Nagisa peered at the photo, taking in the slender figure and attractive 
face of the woman, the happiness in her eyes as the three of them; Mina, 
Emmie and Shizuma, stood arm in arm in the back garden, laughing at 
something out of shot.

The scene looked wonderfully idyllic.

&quot;She&#39;s very pretty Mrs Hanazono,&quot; Nagisa said quietly, admiring the 
woman.

Mina wore a fond expression, and replied,

&quot;Yes, she is,&quot; after which she started serving the tea. Turning from the 
photo, Nagisa came to sit with Shizuma.

As Mina concentrated on pouring, the former-Etoile squeezed her 
girlfriend&#39;s hand reassuringly and smiled at the red head, mouthing the 
words &#39;I love you&#39; to the fourth year. Nagisa took another deep breath, 
rolling her eyes and exaggerating her nerves so the former-Etoile could 
see, and Shizuma nodded her head in understanding.

Mina looked up as she passed the cups out.

&quot;So how are you finding Astrea Hill then Nagisa? It&#39;s your first winter 
there isn&#39;t it?&quot; She asked, sitting back in the sofa opposite, holding 
her cup and saucer.

Nagisa bit her lip and tried her hand at settling into the relaxed 
atmosphere,

&quot;Yes Mrs Hanazono it is. Um, how am I finding it?&quot; Her eyes sparkled as 
she regarded the sixth year sitting next to her with a sideways glance, 
&quot;Well, the Etoile of the time tried kissing me in front of the entire 
Dormitory on my first day, so I&#39;m sure you can understand if I say it&#39;s 
been a bit of an eye opener.&quot;

Mina&#39;s face spread wide with amusement and she shot her daughter an 
exasperated look as she exclaimed,

&quot;Shizuma!&quot;

Nagisa continued,

&quot;Since then she&#39;s thrown me into a swimming pool, bored me half to death 
with French and continued to embarrass me at every possible opportunity, 
the last occasion being the time she declared her love to me in the 
middle of the Etoile election ceremony before dragging me off the 
stage.&quot;

Mina&#39;s slender frame shook as she laughed heartily, watching her 
daughter as the former-Etoile blushed, looking away and mumbling 
something very rude under her breath. Mina admired the fourth year&#39;s 
courage and her strength of character, despite the fact the young woman 
obviously felt very awkward. She continued the subject, adding,

&quot;She&#39;s always been a bit compulsive, although I have no idea where she 
gets it from.&quot;

Nagisa smiled as her girlfriend squirmed,

&quot;I&#39;d already heard about the ceremony incident from Sister Mizue 
admittedly,&quot; Mina explained, continuing to smirk with amusement. &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t get the old bat off the phone for an hour as she lectured me on 
how disruptive Shizuma&#39;s actions at been. I really struggled during the 
call and burst into hysterics as soon as I put the phone down,&quot; she 
grinned. &quot;Emmie said it was typical Shizuma; always fashionably late.&quot;

Shizuma sat red faced for a moment, then replied in her defence,

&quot;Well I couldn&#39;t let the letch Nagisa dorms steal her could I?&quot;

Mina smiled, replying in a patronizing tone,

&quot;Well if you weren&#39;t such an air head honey, you wouldn&#39;t have let 
someone as cute as Nagisa loose in the first place,&quot; prompting both 
girls to blush at the same time.

Mina regarded the younger girl with fond eyes,

&quot;You know she&#39;s not shut up about you since summer?&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s mouth dropped open, and she looked at the silver haired sixth 
year in surprise. Mina continued,

&quot;I don&#39;t get to see Shizuma often, but every time I&#39;ve spoken to her 
lately it&#39;s been &#39;Nagisa this, Nagisa that,&#39; or &#39;I&#39;ve really upset 
Nagisa, I feel so awful Mother.&#39; You certainly made an impression!&quot; Mina 
chuckled.

Shizuma snapped back, her cheeks now a deep shade of burgundy,

&quot;Are you done with embarrassing me already Mother? You&#39;ll be fishing out 
the baby photos next!&quot; Shizuma scowled, but the sound of the back door 
rescued her from Mina&#39;s reply and further torment.

Three pairs of eyes turned to the sound of keys on the kitchen counter 
before the brown haired woman from the photos entered the room, Shizuma 
standing and greeting the newcomer with open arms,

&quot;Save me Emmie, they&#39;re picking on me!&quot; she said, giving the European 
woman a huge hug. They embraced for a moment, Emmie kissing the sixth 
year on the forehead fondly before replying in a soft french accent,

&quot;Yes I heard. Fashionably late wasn&#39;t it?&quot; prompting Shizuma to blush 
again and shoot Emmie a dirty look as she sat back down next to Nagisa,

&quot;I don&#39;t love you anymore either!&quot; she muttered.

The french woman grinned as she rounded the other sofa, leaning over the 
back to greet Mina with a tender kiss,

&quot;I couldn&#39;t get the sauce, but everything else is here.&quot;

Mina smiled back,

&quot;Thank you. Was it busy?&quot;

Emmie shook her head as she straightened up, removing her coat and 
turning to take it through to their bedroom. Much like the Hanazono 
women, Emmie was slender and graceful, her long brown hair tied neatly 
in a French plat, her face attractive in a western sense, all dark eyes 
and soft lips. She wore a pair of suit trousers and an expensive looking 
blouse, very much the fashion conscious woman.

&quot;No, it was pretty quiet; I got a bottle of wine too.&quot;

Mina called through as the brown haired woman disappeared briefly,

&quot;Good idea, although the girls are returning to school before curfew,&quot; 
then she shot Shizuma a more serious look.

&quot;Speaking of which, if you&#39;re going to drink my champagne honey, can you 
try and avoid the imported vintages that cost me an arm and a leg in 
future?&quot;

Shizuma covered her face and curled up in embarrassment, causing Mina to 
laugh again.

&quot;You know you can&#39;t hide anything from your Mother,&quot; Emmie chuckled as 
she returned to the living room, perching on the sofa&#39;s arm next to 
Shizuma&#39;s mother as she regarded the fourth year sat next to Shizuma.

&quot;So this is the infamous Nagisa?&quot; she asked, stretching her slender hand 
out across the table to the red head,

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you.&quot;

Nagisa shook the hand gently, smiling back,

&quot;Likewise, thank you.&quot;

The french woman leaned back, looking at Mina,

&quot;Shall I start on dinner my love?&quot; she asked, pushing the sleeves of her 
blouse up in preparation. Mina nodded, returning her tea cup to the 
tray.

&quot;I&#39;ll come give you a hand quick,&quot; then turning to the girls she said, 
&quot;Excuse us for a minute.&quot;

And as the two women left, Nagisa tipped her head into the soft back of 
the sofa, looking sideways and smiling at her girlfriend, finally 
beginning to feel herself relaxing.

Shizuma smiled back, and ran a finger down the fourth year&#39;s cheek.

&quot;She&#39;s amazing,&quot; Nagisa muttered, wishing her Mother was even remotely 
similar.

- - - - -

&quot;Ohtori-san, Ohtori-san!&quot; called a breathless voice from the edge of the 
paddock.

Amane reigned in Star Bride, and turned to face the panting student 
resting her hand on the white railing as she bent double, trying to 
catch her breath,

Amane turned the horse towards the young girl, calling,

&quot;Yes?&quot;

The blonde haired third year stood upright, and between wheezing breaths 
she replied,

&quot;There&#39;s a telephone call for you at the stable. Someone asking for you 
by name.&quot;

Amane looked back across the muddy field before nodding her thanks to 
the younger student, snapping the reigns and galloping her steed toward 
the painted wooden building. The powerful beast crossed the distance 
quickly, and dismounting smoothly, Amane wrapped Star Bride&#39;s reigns 
around the paddock railing in a slip knot before jogging over to the 
open stable doors.

The telephone was hanging off the hook, the receiver resting on a barrel 
of hay next to it. Snatching up the hand set, she put the phone to her 
ear,

&quot;Hello?&quot;

There was no immediate reply, and Amane repeated again,

&quot;Hello? Who is it?&quot;

A soft voice replied, sounding choked and very quiet,

&quot;Amane?&quot;

The Spican&#39;s blue eyes widened in recognition, and she replied in a 
desperate tone,

&quot;Hikari?&quot;

But the voice didn&#39;t reply, and after a moment&#39;s awkward silence, the 
receiver rang off, the line going dead with a crackle and a hiss before 
the long tone kicked in.

Amane stood for a second, her brown eyes gazing at the floor, her heart 
hanging like a lead weight in her chest.

The handset slipped from the fifth year&#39;s fingers, and with an 
excruciating look on her face, she slid down the wall, clutching herself 
as she dropped to the floor below.

&quot;Hikari...&quot; she repeated, tears welling in her eyes.

- - - - -

&quot;And then Shizuma looks the man straight in the eyes and asks, &#39;Please 
sir, can I have my ice cream back?&#39; at which point the rest of us nearly 
died with embarrassment!&quot; Mina said, peering through streaming tears of 
laughter, trying to keep a straight face long enough to finish the 
story.

Nagisa, Emmie and Mina burst back into hysterics, while Shizuma buried 
her face in her hands, silver hair falling forward as she rested her 
head on the dining table before her, rocking back and forth in 
disbelief.

Looking up she exclaimed,

&quot;Mother!&quot; The smile behind her eyes was undeniable, and she struggled 
herself to remain serious,

&quot;Please stop, I&#39;m dying here!&quot;

Mina wiped the tears away from her cheeks, the fits of laughter slowly 
subsiding, and she rested her head in her hands for a moment while she 
recovered.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry honey, it&#39;s not like I get the opportunity often is it,&quot; she 
smiled, flicking her hair from her face.

The four sat around the solid oak dining table, the leftovers of their 
afternoon meal scattered between dishes across the table top, their 
empty plates testament to their full stomachs.

Nagisa leant sideways, wrapping an arm around her girlfriend&#39;s waist 
before fondly kissing the former-Etoile on her burning red cheek.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Shizuma-sama, really I am. But you were so cute when you were 
little,&quot; she grinned, adding in a squeaky voice,

&quot;&#39;But I really like ice cream mister!&#39;&quot; and the three women burst back 
into laughter again, Nagisa gripping her stomach as her eyes glazed 
over.

&quot;I hate all of you!&quot; Shizuma yelled as an exaggerated scowl took to her 
face, shaking her head in mock dismay, grinning herself before throwing 
her serviette at her Mother playfully.

The girls sat back in their chairs, smiling and chuckling softly, 
feeling sated after dinner and pleasantly exhausted from the long 
afternoon of constant jokes and teasing.

&quot;The meal was delicious; thank you Mother, thank you Emmie-sama&quot; Shizuma 
offered politely, still harbouring her pretend scowl. Nagisa added her 
thanks in a small voice.

Shizuma stood and started collecting plates and cutlery,

&quot;At least in the kitchen I won&#39;t have to listen to you embarrass me any 
further,&quot; she grumbled, taking the first load through.

Emmie did likewise, taking the roasting tin and serving dishes, leaving 
Mina and Nagisa to themselves.

The silver haired woman smiled as she regarded Nagisa over the rim of 
her wine glass, sipping it slowly.

&quot;She&#39;s completely different since she met you.&quot;

Nagisa tipped her head, looking thoughtful as Mina continued,

&quot;After Kaori&#39;s death, she was an empty shell. For almost a year and a 
half, every time we saw her she was sullen and withdrawn,&quot; the woman 
brushed her hair back,

&quot;But ever since summer, she&#39;s been a totally different person. Smiling, 
happy, always whittling on about you for one reason or another.&quot;

She smiled,

&quot;I&#39;ve been desperate to meet you.&quot;

Nagisa looked away, blushing a little.

&quot;You&#39;ve been very accommodating Mrs Hanazono. Today has been really 
nice,&quot; she said, then adding politely, &quot;and as Shizuma-sama said, the 
food was wonderful.&quot;

Mina smiled again, tipping her glass to Nagisa in thanks for the 
compliment.

&quot;I didn&#39;t get the opportunity to meet Kaori-san, I&#39;m glad things have 
been different with yourself.&quot;

The red head bowed her head politely, hearing the name nowhere near as 
uncomfortable as it used to be.

Nagisa leaned forward in curiosity, peering at one of the photos on the 
wall that caught her eye. The smartly dressed, formal looking woman in 
the picture was a stark contrast to the casual mother-of-one that sat 
opposite the red head at the dining room table now.

Shizuma&#39;s mother followed Nagisa&#39;s gaze,

&quot;That&#39;s my husband and I with Prime Minister Koizumi,&quot; Mina explained, 
&quot;presenting a cheque to the International Cancer Research Federation. It 
was one of the landmarks for the Corporation.&quot;

Nagisa looked at the picture in awe, sighing at the gravity of the event 
and the size of the sum written on the oversized card board cheque. She 
looked at Mina in admiration,

&quot;You must have been so proud,&quot; she said, almost speechless.

Mina&#39;s face was written with dismay as she replied,

&quot;No, actually.&quot; She paused, looking down at the table, twisting the stem 
of her wine glass back and forth as she explained, &quot;That was during one 
of the worst periods of our marriage, not long after my husband had 
discovered my relationship with Emmie. I&#39;d just sent Shizuma away to 
boarding school.&quot;

Nagisa returned her gaze to the picture, her face taking a sad 
expression.

&quot;I can&#39;t imagine what that must have been like,&quot; she mumbled softly.

Mina sighed and stood, pushing her chair under the table before 
motioning Nagisa to join her on the sofas.

&quot;I won&#39;t pretend any of it was easy. There was a time five years ago 
when I couldn&#39;t honestly say I knew my daughter at all,&quot; she remarked, 
taking a seat opposite the fourth year. She leant forward, hands clasped 
around the wine glass before her,

&quot;I&#39;m a lucky woman Nagisa; I&#39;m blessed with a wonderful daughter and a 
loving partner to spend my life with. My husband is a very understanding 
man, and the company we&#39;ve built has achieved amazing things and helped 
many, many people. But it took a long time and a lot of pain before we 
finally reached this cosy situation.&quot;

She considered the fourth year, looking the young woman up and down with 
a shrewd eye,

&quot;Do you know why Shizuma brought you here Nagisa?&quot;

Nagisa was surprised by the question, and looked at the woman in 
confusion.

Mina explained,

&quot;Nagisa, in three months time my daughter graduates from Astrea, at 
which point she could end up halfway across the country depending on 
which University she decides to accept.&quot;

The woman&#39;s voice took a serious tone, and she continued,

&quot;I love my daughter very much Nagisa and I don&#39;t want to see her hurt 
again, but I do want her to take her career choices seriously. Only a 
few days ago she called to tell me she wanted to change University so 
she wouldn&#39;t have to move away from Astrea; so she could remain close to 
you.&quot;

At this, Nagisa&#39;s heart sunk, and she looked away, not sure how to read 
the conversation and fearing the worst from Mina&#39;s next sentence,

&quot;Our culture in this country seems to have this strange preconception 
about young women. We&#39;re free to run around doing all kinds of weird and 
wonderful things while we&#39;re still at school, loving who we want as 
openly as we want, to the point where the television and media is full 
of images encouraging us to do just that. But as soon as we graduate, 
we&#39;re supposed to develop the sudden urge to settle down, get married 
and forget everything and anyone we had feelings for beforehand.&quot;

She sighed,

&quot;Nagisa, the loneliness in my life, the hollow pit in my heart after 
losing Emmie and marrying my husband is testament to just how wrong that 
preconception is. I had everything that most women could ask for, and 
all I wanted to do was curl up and die. The pain and misery I put my 
daughter and marriage through afterwards are living proof of what 
happens when you blindly ignore those feelings.&quot;

Putting the wine glass on the table, she reached forward, taking 
Nagisa&#39;s hands in her own, holding the fourth year&#39;s gaze as she 
continued.

&quot;I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is this; I know Shizuma&#39;s graduation is 
going to be hard for both of you, but regardless of what your parents 
may think, regardless of what society and the world around you may 
think, once Shizuma leaves Astrea, I&#39;m prepared to do anything and 
everything in my power so that if the pair of you still wish to continue 
your relationship, it will remain viable for you to do so. I don&#39;t care 
if that means finding Shizuma an apartment on Astrea Hill, or providing 
tickets every weekend so she can fly down from University to see you. If 
that&#39;s what it takes, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.&quot;

Mina gave Nagisa a fond smile, adding,

&quot;Ever since my daughter met you, she&#39;s been a totally different person. 
She&#39;s happy again, confident and smiling and full of life. And now, 
having finally met you today, I can appreciate why that&#39;s the case. 
You&#39;re a wonderful young lady, and my daughter is very lucky to have you 
beside her.&quot;

Nagisa bowed her head in embarrassment, blushing deeply, the glass of 
wine she&#39;d drunk during dinner the only thing saving her from freezing 
up completely. Peering up meekly to meet Mina&#39;s piercing sapphire gaze, 
she said in a quiet voice,

&quot;Thank you Mrs Hanazono.&quot;

Mina smiled, and asserted,

&quot;My name is Mina, Nagisa.&quot;

Nagisa corrected herself, repeating,

&quot;Thank you Mina-sama.&quot;

And for a moment, the two sat there in silence, Mina&#39;s words sinking 
into Nagisa&#39;s overwhelmed mind.

&quot;Playing with your giant wooden spoon again Mother?&quot; Shizuma&#39;s soft 
voice called from the doorway, the silver haired sixth year leaning 
against the door post, her head resting against the wood work with a 
content smile on her face.

&quot;Come sit with us honey,&quot; Mina said, releasing Nagisa&#39;s hands, reaching 
for Emmie as the attractive french woman also appeared from the kitchen, 
perching on the arm rest beside her.

Shizuma followed suit, and crossed the room, curling up on the sofa 
behind the fourth year. Nagisa leaned back into the former-Etoile&#39;s 
embrace as the sixth year encircled the red head&#39;s waist, holding her 
lovingly as the fourth year&#39;s head rested on the older girl&#39;s shoulder, 
her brown eyes glazing over.

The four sat there for a while, lost in their collective thoughts, 
reflecting on the day. Mother and daughter traded happy smiles, and Mina 
looked with proud eyes at the couple before her, satisfied with the 
chain of events following her child&#39;s desperate pleas over the phone. 
The girl presented to her, the one Shizuma had described as being the 
only person that could make her happy had been everything Shizuma had 
claimed she was, and knowing all too well herself how rare it was to 
come across someone like that in life, Mina felt happy now to have the 
chance to ensure her daughter wouldn&#39;t lose that special companionship 
the way she almost had herself.

Since the funeral two years ago, she&#39;d desperately wanted to continue as 
the understanding Mother, and finally, here was her chance to do so in a 
way that could truly make a difference.

Nagisa raised a hand to idly play with Shizuma&#39;s hair, the long strands 
enveloping the pair of them, a combination of the wine and the emotional 
stress of the day beginning to take its toll, her eye lids feeling heavy 
and the urge to yawn overcoming her.

Shizuma smiled, asking softly,

&quot;Tired my love?&quot;

Nagisa looked up and nodded, her face feeling flushed. As she did, 
something caught Mina&#39;s eye and the silver haired woman frowned, leaning 
forward as she deftly hooked the necklace with the summer house key 
attached out from around Nagisa&#39;s neck. She sat there for a moment, 
turning the key over in her hand, before looking at Shizuma with a wry 
smile,

&quot;Shizuma, I give you a substantial allowance each month. Please don&#39;t 
embarrass me by suggesting this is the best you can decorate your 
girlfriend&#39;s neck with.&quot;

Beside her, Emmie grinned, adding,

&quot;If you take a left rather than a right at the bottom of the road, 
there&#39;s that parade of shops on the way back to the station; you 
remember the one Shizuma, with the statue of the Dolphin in the centre?&quot;

Shizuma nodded, surprised by her Mother&#39;s unexpected approval to spend 
money,

&quot;There&#39;s a Jewellers in there; perhaps you could find something for 
Nagisa on the way back to the Dormitories?&quot;

Nagisa, feeling thoroughly spoilt by the lavished attention and the talk 
of gifts blushed brightly and hid her face in Shizuma&#39;s hair, mumbling,

&quot;That really isn&#39;t necessary and I&#39;m feeling really self conscious now; 
can&#39;t we go back to teasing Shizuma?&quot;

- - - - -

Miyuki slid the door to the Green House closed behind her, the metal 
frame cold against her hand. She looked across the foliage before her 
and up at the high garden table. The plants looked tired and wilted, and 
she made a mental note to mention it at the evening&#39;s meeting if her 
motion proved to be successful.

Sighing, she looked vexed as she realised her quarry weren&#39;t present.

It was late, only a few hours from curfew, and despite scouring the 
entire school, Shizuma and Nagisa were nowhere to be found.

Where were they both?

- - - - -

Having thanked Mina and Emmie for the wonderful day and bid them 
farewell with warm embraces, the girls had set off towards the station 
to catch their train back to Astrea. Out of curiosity, Shizuma had 
suggested they take a look at the Jewellers on the way through as they 
had a little while to wait before the train arrived, and it was better 
than standing around bored in a cold station. Nagisa had agreed 
reluctantly, insisting that it was just to look as gifts weren&#39;t 
necessary and she would feel extremely guilty as she couldn&#39;t afford to 
return the sentiment.

As they walked, the girls chatted, Nagisa still stunned by the day&#39;s 
experiences.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe how relaxed she is about it all. I&#39;d love to have 
someone I could talk to the way you can to her,&quot; the fourth year said, 
sighing as she considered the nightmare she would have explaining her 
feelings for Shizuma to her own mother. &quot;It explains a lot about why you 
are the way you are; why you&#39;re so confident about being with other 
girls.&quot; Nagisa broke into a grin, adding, &quot;And why you&#39;re so damned good 
at French!&quot;

Shizuma replied in a flat tone,

&quot;It&#39;s not always been like that Nagisa; there was a long time before she 
opened up to me when I had no idea what was going on, having just been 
dumped at Astrea and seemingly forgotten.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s face dropped and she apologised quickly,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Shizuma-sama; I&#39;m being thoughtless and getting carried away. 
It&#39;s just hard to imagine you two were so distant in the past given how 
close you are now.&quot;

Not meaning to make Nagisa feel bad, the former-Etoile reached for the 
red head&#39;s hand, smiling as she replied,

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that, you weren&#39;t being thoughtless. And you&#39;re 
right, I&#39;m very lucky; she&#39;s been great over the past couple of years, 
particularly since I told her about you. I don&#39;t think she knew how to 
deal with me before that.&quot;

Nagisa smiled,

&quot;Offering to fly you about and find you an apartment in Astrea is so 
cool,&quot; Nagisa grinned, &quot;She&#39;s a true romantic.&quot;

Shizuma chuckled and replied,

&quot;No, she&#39;s in love with a French woman who&#39;s a true romantic, and she 
has far too much disposable income for her own good. Anyway, it&#39;s for 
us, not just me,&quot; the sixth year corrected.

Nagisa looked puzzled,

&quot;Us?&quot;

Shizuma laughed, replying,

&quot;Well I wasn&#39;t planning on living in it alone my love.&quot;

Nagisa baulked,

&quot;But my parents can&#39;t afford for me to live out of the Dormitories 
Shizuma-sama. God knows how I&#39;d explain that one to them anyway.&quot;

Shizuma squeezed the other girl&#39;s hand and shrugged her shoulders 
undaunted,

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have to; leave that to my Mother, she can talk anyone 
round. Besides, they wouldn&#39;t have to pay a thing; my family can afford 
to cover both of us and it&#39;s not much different paying for two when 
you&#39;ve got to pay for one anyway. It&#39;s not as though you eat like a 
horse or anything.&quot;

Shizuma paused, giving the fourth year a funny look, implying some doubt 
to the fact and Nagisa put on a long face in jest, poking her girlfriend 
in the ribs,

&quot;That wasn&#39;t nice,&quot; she mumbled,

Shizuma&#39;s eyes sparkled mischievously as she continued,

&quot;Anyway, as far as they&#39;d be concerned, you&#39;ve made a close friend of 
considerable status that you&#39;d rather not lose contact with; they don&#39;t 
need to know anymore than that, and I&#39;m sure we can find somewhere close 
enough to Miator that you wouldn&#39;t need to be driven in.&quot;

Then Shizuma giggled, adding,

&quot;Unless you want to stay another two years with Tamao that is,&quot; grinning 
evilly.

Nagisa pouted back,

&quot;Stop teasing or I might just do that,&quot; she smiled.

As the two continued on toward the shopping mall, Nagisa pondered the 
idea quietly, considering what it would be like, living out of the 
Dormitories and away from the other girls at the school. Peaceful she 
imagined, and the idea of having their privacy and somewhere to invite 
people to let their hair down appealed greatly.

She smiled, announcing,

&quot;It would be nice having our own place wouldn&#39;t it.&quot;

Shizuma nodded, but added with her sensible hat on,

&quot;I was thinking perhaps we could stay at the summer house over Christmas 
rather than remaining at the Dorms. I&#39;m sure your parents would agree to 
that, and it&#39;ll give us some time alone away from Miyuki and Tamao who 
are bound to stay over winter. If we survive the two weeks there without 
killing each other then perhaps we can think seriously about you leaving 
the Strawberry Dorms in March.&quot;

Nagisa nodded in agreement, liking the idea and feeling very reassured 
and mature at the thought of having things planned out ahead of them.

She smiled, beaming back at the older girl,

&quot;I&#39;m so happy Shizuma. Today has taken such a weight off my mind.&quot;

Shizuma looked back fondly, continuing Nagisa&#39;s train of thought,

&quot;It&#39;s reassuring seeing them together isn&#39;t it,&quot; she said, &quot;knowing it 
can endure.&quot;

Nagisa pictured Shizuma&#39;s mother and the pretty French woman curled up 
on the sofa as Shizuma had played piano over coffee before they left. 
The couple looked so settled, so happy, and Nagisa&#39;s heart warmed to the 
idea that the feelings she had for Shizuma now might also last far into 
the future.

She smiled at the young woman on the other end of her arm.

&quot;Ah, there it is,&quot; Shizuma announced, pointing across the tiled floor of 
the parade to the chic looking Jewellery store, it&#39;s wide windows filled 
with sparkling goods and understated Christmas ornaments.

&quot;Ah it&#39;s a Swag,&quot; she grinned, nodding with approval, &quot;Emmie knows all 
the best places.&quot;

The girls approached the glass front, and Shizuma scanned the display 
trays, looking for inspiration. Nagisa took in the sparkling gems, the 
gorgeous precious metals and the jaw dropping price tags that they 
carried,

&quot;It&#39;s all so expensive here,&quot; she mumbled in a small voice. &quot;I could 
never consider shopping in place like this.&quot;

Shizuma ignored the younger girl, mulling something over before her face 
lit up with a devious idea. She looked at the red head and smiling she 
asked,

&quot;What size ring do you take Nagisa?&quot;

The fourth year looked back confused,

&quot;I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;ve never needed to know before.&quot;

With that, Shizuma grabbed Nagisa by the arm, dragging her through the 
shop door, across the plush red carpet towards a stoic looking attendant 
standing behind the sweeping counter that ran around the edge of the 
room in a smooth curve, its display cases crammed with trays upon trays 
of stylish looking jewellery, watches and accessories.

Nodding politely, the attendant asked,

&quot;Can I help miss?&quot;

Shizuma nodded in return and asked,

&quot;May I have my friend&#39;s finger sized please?&quot;

The gentleman nodded, and produced a set of sizing rings from behind the 
counter, stepping around to approach the girls.

Shizuma beckoned Nagisa for her hand,

&quot;The index finger miss?&quot; the attendant asked, but Shizuma shook her 
head, pointing at the finger she wanted tested.

Nagisa&#39;s eyes flashed with confusion.

&quot;No, this one please, and can I double check mine too?&quot;

The gentleman smiled, and proceeded to take the required information, 
trying several of the dull metal rings before jotting down the correct 
size for the pair.

Thanking the man, Shizuma added,

&quot;I&#39;d like to see tray one thirty four please,&quot; before turning to Nagisa 
and flashing her a poignant look.

&quot;Go on; it won&#39;t be a surprise otherwise and you&#39;re not supposed to see 
the price.&quot;

Nagisa blanched,

&quot;Shizuma-sama, I said I didn&#39;t want you to - &quot;

The former-Etoile glared at her,

&quot;Outside Nagisa.&quot;

Nagisa rolled her eyes in frustration before turning and leaving, 
feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable given the price tags of the items 
she&#39;d seen Shizuma looking at. This was definitely out of her league and 
she had no idea what the sixth year was playing it; they weren&#39;t even 
allowed to wear rings at Miator.

Satisfied that Nagisa was out of sight, Shizuma turned back to the 
attendant as he held the tray gingerly before him,

&quot;May I see that one please?&quot; she asked.

The man raised an eyebrow, offering politely in a low voice,

&quot;They&#39;re very expensive miss.&quot;

Shizuma shot the man a cold emerald glare, producing her photo identity 
card and her visa, placing them with a curt snap on the glass counter. 
Flatly she stated,

&quot;Yes. I&#39;d like two, one in each of the sizes you took.&quot;

The attendant blinked, and then nodded quickly, bowing as low as humanly 
possible as he took the cards to the register for processing.

- - - - -

Nagisa pulled her wrap closer around her shoulders, gazing across the 
parade while she waited for Shizuma to finish in the shop. She was 
flustered and a little annoyed, knowing full well she wouldn&#39;t be able 
to accept whatever Shizuma was buying with a clear conscience. It was 
all far too expensive and there was no way she could buy anything nearly 
as pricey in return.

The electric doors of the shop swished open as the sixth year remerged 
with a huge grin on her face. She smiled mischievously at Nagisa as she 
approached the red head. Nagisa looked back with sullen eyes,

&quot;Shizuma-sama, I told you no. I can&#39;t accept something from that shop. 
It&#39;s too expensive.&quot;

The former-Etoile scowled back,

&quot;Think of it as an investment on my part; it&#39;ll stop you running off 
with Tamao. Besides, it&#39;s not my money remember.&quot;

Shizuma took the red head by the arm, looking around for something 
amongst the crowd of people shuffling past in the busy parade.

&quot;But we can&#39;t even wear rings at Miator,&quot; Nagisa argued, still 
determined not to accept the gift.

Shizuma snapped back,

&quot;I was the Etoile of Astrea Hill for two years, and you&#39;re trying to 
debate uniform rules with me?&quot; she asked. Then, with a broad smile, 
whatever she was looking for caught her eye and she dragged Nagisa 
through the tightly packed parade toward the ornate stone fountain in 
the middle. The water feature consisted of a wide stone pool with a 
large bronze Dolphin arcing into the air on a moulded spray of water 
beneath it, the fountain&#39;s water showering from the Dolphin&#39;s crest.

Nagisa looked puzzled as Shizuma explained,

&quot;There is only one condition under which a student of Miator may wear a 
ring on her finger, and that addition was made to the school rules to 
reflect the number of girls being entered into pre-arranged marital 
contracts by their parents.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s eyes sparkled as she pulled Nagisa up onto the marble wall 
that ran around the pool&#39;s edge, producing two boxes from the fancy 
looking bag the shop attendant had given her, dropping the bag to the 
floor at her feet. Opening each box she produced a pair of plain but 
stylish looking platinum bands, their surfaces brushed into a fine 
texture which caught the light from the coloured spots set into the 
floor of the rock pool below them. She dropped the display cases into 
the bag below and shook her hair from her face, straightening herself as 
she looked at the fourth year before her.

Grinning, she took Nagisa&#39;s left hand in her right, holding the smaller 
ring at tip of Nagisa&#39;s engagement finger,

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not planning to throw you into this pool,&quot; she teased, 
before looking directly into the fourth year&#39;s eyes.

Nagisa stared back, completely perplexed,

&quot;Nagisa Aoi, will you marry me?&quot; she asked, trying to keep a straight 
face, ready to burst into a fit of laughter at any moment.

Nagisa&#39;s jaw dropped, and for a moment she stared back at the other girl 
in stunned silence.

Then slowly, Shizuma&#39;s resolve caved and she started giggling 
childishly. Nagisa looked even more confused, before finally realising 
what was so funny.

&quot;You spent all that money on an engagement ring just so I could get away 
with wearing a present from you in class?&quot; Nagisa asked. Shizuma nodded 
with a smirk, and the two girls burst into laughter at the 
ridiculousness of the situation. The crowd around them turned to regard 
the girls stood precariously on the pool&#39;s edge, wondering what was 
going on.

The couple stood for a moment, chuckling at themselves until suddenly 
Nagisa&#39;s face took on a very serious look and she promptly stopped 
laughing. Looking Shizuma in the eye, she replied in a strange tone,

&quot;No Shizuma; I won&#39;t put a ring on my engagement finger just to stop 
your Mother teasing you next time we see her.&quot;

The smile dropped from Shizuma&#39;s face, the sixth year unsure of how to 
react. But Nagisa didn&#39;t pull her hand away. Instead, as Shizuma glanced 
sideways, overwhelmed by mixed emotions and the idea of wasting so much 
money, Nagisa turned the older girl&#39;s chin with the fingers of her free 
hand, forcing the former-Etoile to look again into her eyes. She took 
the other ring from Shizuma with her right hand, holding it at the tip 
of Shizuma&#39;s engagement finger; the two girls stood holding each other&#39;s 
hands up in the space between them,

Nagisa whispered back softly,

&quot;Now ask me again. And this time, say it as though you mean it.&quot;

Shizuma looked stunned,

&quot;Nagisa?&quot; she replied, emerald eyes wide.

&quot;Quickly Shizuma, before I stop to think about what I&#39;m doing and lose 
my nerve,&quot; Nagisa pressed, her voice carrying an urgent edge,

Shizuma looked long and hard into the brown eyes regarding her as she 
tried to read the other girl&#39;s face. She stood silent for a moment, 
watching Nagisa&#39;s shimmering eyes. Then with a flourish and a cocky 
smile, she dropped to one knee, grinning up at the red head as Nagisa 
gazed down at her girlfriend.

Shizuma repeated softly,

&quot;Nagisa Aoi, will you marry me?&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s lips cracked into a beaming smile, and she quietly replied,

&quot;Yes Shizuma Hanazono, I will.&quot; Then as she slipped the ring she held 
onto Shizuma&#39;s finger, again she whispered, &quot;I will.&quot;

Shizuma gently slid the other band into place, before standing and 
embracing the young woman, the girls engulfing each other in a long 
tender kiss to bemused applause from the watching crowd.

The girls broke off the kiss in amazement at the response around them, 
Nagisa blushing as she realised they had an audience. Then laughing 
again, they looked back into each other&#39;s eyes, grinning before 
returning to their embrace, the on looking shoppers amused by the 
strange school girls playing at being grown ups.

- - - - -

It was extremely close to six o&#39;clock as the girls made it to the 
Dormitory gates, Sister Mizue already ominously present as the gates 
slid closed behind the couple.

Approaching the old woman before them, the girls bowed their heads 
respectfully, the Sister asking,

&quot;Where have you been Hanazono-san, Aoi-san?&quot;

Shizuma replied for the pair,

&quot;My Mother demanded to see us following your telephone call regarding 
events at the Etoile ceremony Sister; she wanted to discuss our 
actions.&quot;

The Sister nodded in satisfaction, replying,

&quot;I hope she highlighted the error in your behaviour Hanazono-san,&quot; to 
which Shizuma nodded and added,

&quot;I would like to apologise again for my disruptive actions Sister; I was 
acting irrationally, fearing I would lose a valued friendship.&quot;

The Sister smiled uncharacteristically,

&quot;Well you have the perfect opportunity to make up for it now through 
service to Astrea&#39;s students.&quot;

She motioned toward the Dormitory building,

&quot;The school council is waiting for the pair of you. Please accompany me 
to the council chambers,&quot; prompting the two girl to exchange puzzled 
glances.

- - - - -

As the heavy wooden doors swung open, Nagisa blanched as she found 
herself facing the full school council seated around the circular wooden 
table. Everyone was there aside from the missing Etoile pair, and 
strangely, Tamao was also present, stood at one end of the table.

The gathered pupils chimed together,

&quot;Good evening Sister.&quot;

The grey haired woman nodded in return,

&quot;Good evening Council,&quot; and she motioned to Nagisa. &quot;Please join 
Suzumi-san at the head of the table.&quot;

Nagisa did as she was told, consciously keeping her hands behind her 
back, acutely aware of the smooth platinum band on her finger.

The formality of the council room was stifling and her head swam.

&quot;Thank you for assembling on short notice Council,&quot; the Sister began, 
&quot;after discussion with the staff board during the day, we have decided 
to accept the Council&#39;s proposal for an interim Etoile appointment.&quot;

She turned to Tamao and Nagisa as they stood in silence at the end of 
the long table, the other girl&#39;s eyes all falling on them in unison.

&quot;In light of Spica surrendering its appointed position in the absence of 
Konohana-san, we will be instating Suzumi-san and Aoi-san in their wake, 
until such time that it is felt this appointment needs reconsidering or 
another election process is due.&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s jaw went slack.

The Sister turned next to Shizuma, a stern look on her face,

&quot;To atone for her behaviour at the election ceremony and in 
consideration of her experience and ability during her time as Etoile, 
Hanazono-san will act as an aide, guiding her Miatorian colleagues 
during the busy festive season. This is one of the key periods in the 
year, and the loss of the Etoile during the organization of the yuletide 
events is unacceptable.&quot;

The old woman nodded in satisfaction,

&quot;I believe this arrangement should be capable of maintaining the 
student&#39;s continuity.&quot;

In the corner of Shizuma&#39;s eye, she caught Miyuki smiling at her, a look 
of achievement written in her eyes as she regarded the former-Etoile.

Tamao and Nagisa nodded politely, Nagisa obviously stunned by the news, 
but Tamao seemingly unphased,

&quot;We will do our best Sister,&quot; Tamao pronounced in a proud voice, smiling 
at the red headed fourth year stood next to her.

Shizuma pondered Miyuki&#39;s reaction, then feeling the cool surface of the 
ring on her finger, she matched her fellow sixth year&#39;s gaze with 
determined eyes, replying coolly,

&quot;Indeed Sister, I&#39;m sure the three of us will be more than capable of 
coping with whatever fate throws at us.&quot;

The Sister nodded with an approving eye,

&quot;At midday tomorrow, we will call the girls together at the Cathedral. 
Lessons will be suspended so the announcement can be made. After which, 
you are to reconvene the Council in the evening to discuss Miator&#39;s 
plans for the Christmas Ball and allocate duties.&quot;

Satisfied, she gave a sharp nod before turning to leave,

&quot;Good evening Council.&quot;

And with that, the old woman swept from the room with a purposeful 
stride.
