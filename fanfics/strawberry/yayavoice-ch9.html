<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Amane: What makes you… you?</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  been five days since I’ve seen Nanto-san other than when we’re  having dinner at the dormitory. And even then the only thing I got  from her was a cold glare that said either “I hate you.” or “stop  looking at me”. I still see Hikari as usual, although she did skip  coming here once but that’s not really a big deal, she does have  her own club activities after all. Honestly though, I’m a little  worried around and maybe about her. She has told me that she was  getting worried about Nanto-san… something about always being out  and coming back late, tired and odd smelling. I had decided to  investigate about it myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  didn’t feel like practicing much today, so instead of riding I  decided to just pamper Star Bright a bit just so he won’t get too  upset about not running today. Oh yeah, Hikari won’t be watching me  today. I believe she told me that today would be one of the Saintly  Chorus’ practice days, something they had to do to make up for some  lost time. I considered paying a visit, but I figure I’ll save that  trip some other time… when our relationship has developed further.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  took me a moment for my mind to realize that… if Hikari and I got  together… I cannot be with Nanto-san. I pondered on that thought  for a while and wondered why I thought of it. I must admit… I’m  at a loss for having some sort of feelings towards someone else. Not  just anyone, this someone was so mysterious and seemingly spiteful to  me, which makes me wonder why I even have such feelings.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a little thought I decided that I will visit Hikari after all. It was  still very early, but I guess I can just watch them… I can learn a  little more about Hikari this way. I found myself quickly changing  back into my school uniform and made my way towards the school. It  was closer to the horse riding club than the church and I know that  it held a room where the Saintly Chorus practices. I’ve only passed  the room once or twice before, I’ve never really been there… but  now seemed a good time remedy that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  school’s halls were almost empty without any classes. I gather that  most of the other students are out going about their business. Some  are in their clubrooms, others are in their dormitories, or had gone  home. During my trek towards the Saintly Chorus’ music room, I  found myself recalling the day I had an almost pleasant but very  notable encounter with Nanto-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had just woken up from my more or less peaceful slumber… It wasn’t  the best night of sleep I’ve had since I came face to face with  Nanto-san. I stared at the ceiling; thinking about that raven haired  girl… who was rapidly occupying more of my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even  now, as faint light of the rising sun was piercing my dream world and  rousing me from sleep… It was still with her… I could almost see  her long and lavishly, beautiful jet black hair, crystalline like  amber eyes, soft sakura pink lips, and silky, soft light colored  skin. In my mind I tried making her smile or tried remembering the  times she smiled, but I failed… I could only ever see her face  looking at me with anger, tears or disinterest. To be quite honest…  After having so many people admire me… I am a little bothered that  someone seems to dislike me with so much intensity… It’s a new  and foreign feeling to me, but what’s really bothering me is that,  why do I find that attractive?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  felt myself release a long empty sigh as I got up from bed and  prepared to do my morning duties. It was Sunday, and even now I just  can’t skip my duties. Maybe I should have taken Natsuki and Shizuru  up on their offer to feed and care for Star Bright in my place today.  I guess it’s too late to regret it now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was still around 5am. Star Bright would be expecting me to come over  to feed him and ride for a bit. I changed into my rider’s uniform  and exited my room. From there I made my way to the entrance and was  about to head out of the dorm’s premises when I saw a familiar  black haired girl. She was waving goodbye to some kendo club members  who I would assume are from Miator, as Miator is the one who owns a  Kendo Club… though it’s not impossible for students from other  schools to join, just usually never happens…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found my eyes following her as she moved away from the other girls,  and I could have sworn that my mind was so flooded with so many  thoughts. Too much actually… <em>‘Oh!  Maria-sama…please give me some strength, this girl is making me  think too much.’ </em>I prayed  for salvation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  silent prayers were broken as I noticed the raven haired beauty was  walking away, I decided to follow her and talk to her. <em>‘No  more planning, no more dragging her elsewhere, just talk, and  apologize.’</em> I told  myself, deciding I would not fear rumors and stares of other  students… especially not this early in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  walked after her, I tried calling her… but I felt fear. I was  terribly afraid that if I called her she’d get angry at me… or  was still angry at me. After a few minutes, I realized that she had  not once stopped walking or even looked back behind her. My best  guess was that she didn’t want to talk to me yet. With that in mind  I soon found myself giving up before we could do a second lap around  the dormitory. The sun was rising… I’m sure Star Bright would  start to worry if I’m not on time to feed him.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Heading  out towards the dormitory gates; I found myself instinctively  stopping and turning my head to where I last saw Nanto-san. I was  surprised to see that where she had stopped walking was approximately  a few meters from where she was before I stopped following her. She  had her head turned slightly and I could feel her eye watching me. I  wondered… <em>‘is she  teasing me or something?’</em> I didn’t know the answer. For all I know she was just making sure I  had stopped following her, but a part of me wanted her to tease me,  play with my head, and want me to come after her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  convinced myself that I wanted to try one more time, Star Bright can  wait… something is wrong with me… I’ve never felt this way  before… I’m sure he’ll understand. I took a step and readied  myself to talk to her, but before I could take my second step… she  was approached by a group younger of girls. Her attention immediately  shifted from me to the younger girls who came to her. I found myself  watching them flock around her almost if not exactly like the way  girls flock around the Etoile and myself. Hikari never told me  Nanto-san was popular… or perhaps she didn’t know either. The  girls looked so happy, as she conversed with them just using her  notebook. I then noticed one of them looking and pointing towards me.  I felt very nervous all of a sudden. <em>‘What  could they be talking about?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then found my eyes falling on Nanto-san again, and was surprised to  learn that she was looking my way again. Her face held a smile but I  knew those eyes all to well. How could I not… the image, the  emotion was burned into my mind that day… <em>‘She  hates me.’</em> All I could do  was turn away and flee towards the stables like a coward. I felt like  crying… but I have no good reason to… or at least I thought I  did. No one would understand, heck I didn’t even understand it  myself. But I dare not look back… This was not the time or place to  resolve matters with her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Star  Bright was unusually gentle that day. He did nothing to force my  attention to him. I guess he could sense that I wasn’t feeling so  good… Whatever it was, I felt very thankful to him. The rest was an  uneventful morning. Well… nothing special worth mentioning. Just  the usual crowd of girls watching me ride, Natsuki’s horse was  being difficult, and we had too much hay delivered again… nothing  new.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  arrived at the Saintly Chorus’ club room. I found myself a little  frustrated that the room was empty. That meant that I now had to walk  all the way to the church to meet with Hikari. I quickly made my way  towards the church… but there was really no hurry, it’ll be quite  a while before clubs end. Then again, I thought that if I got there  quickly I might see and learn more of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  as I was about to leave the school… I saw her, Nanto-san passed by  a hall carrying a box full of… something… I really wasn’t sure  but it looked a bit heavy. My eyes followed her and I noted that she  was headed for the west wing, where most art related classrooms and  clubs are held. I wonder if she had noticed me… I wanted to follow  her but…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No…  there was no buts. I wanted to follow her… and I did. I stalked her  by keeping a corner’s distance as I followed where she went. I  watched her as she entered an art room. I waited somewhere to check  if she was just delivering the box there. If I recalled correctly  this area was the least populated area of the school especially after  classes. Most students from Spica tend to join sports clubs leaving  the art and science labs empty and devoid of students by this hour. I  realized that she wasn’t coming out after a few minutes. I  originally thought that she was delivering the box for storage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Determined  to find out what she was doing, I slowly and silently got closer to  the door and peered inside. What I saw surprised me, the room was  almost empty, like it hadn’t been used. It looked clean… at least  as far as an art room can be called clean. There were a few desks  that had their dusty sheets off and surrounded this one easel, a  chair, and painter just beside an open window. I watched as the soft  wind caused the plain white curtains to flutter and the sun’s light  halfway near its journey’s end, entering the room and leaving a  warm glow on the painter’s features.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  that moment, I knew that my heart was a captive… of Nanto Yaya.  Although it was probably for the wrong reasons... I couldn’t deny  it any longer. When I saw her sad eyes as she stared almost blankly  at what she was painting on her canvas, it made me feel sad as well.  She looked like she was in so much pain, so much that I felt guilty…  almost like I was the one who caused it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  gently placed her brush down and tiredly, slumped down on her chair.  She looked up and gazed at the ceiling, I could feel it… her  sadness turning to anger. She kicked one of the desks from where she  sat. It flew a good few feet towards my direction and spilling a few  paint tubes and her sketchbook onto the floor. By pure accident  sketchbook flips open and I find myself staring at the well drawn  picture she had sketched. What she had drawn made my eyes open wide  in surprise. There in white and gray was the familiarly, soft smiling  face of… Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Another  loud noise came startling me out of my discovery as I turned to see  that she had stood up and kicked her easel and canvas which caused it  to crash and fall somewhere near where I stood. It landed right side  up and one could see what she had painted. Again… to my surprise it  was… beautiful, as if it was made by a professional artist. It had  a few blotches of paint where the wet streams streaked and tainted  the picture… most likely because of the kick. But… it was  beautiful painting of an angel who looked like she was singing and  her song making her shine in the darkness. It took me a moment to  realize it was Hikari that she had depicted as such a lovely angel.  There was no mistaking that soft blonde hair, loving blue eyes, and  the way that her lips curled when she’s happy as she sings. It was  indeed Hikari, in all her dazzling beauty, charm and love, that she  had captured on the now paint stained canvas.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  instantly felt very jealous… like a hole suddenly appeared in my  heart. It was at that moment that I realized why she hated me so  much, why I felt so guilty whenever I saw her sad, and why I felt  jealous. <em>‘She loves  Hikari.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was startled out of my revelation when I heard more kicks and  crashes. My gaze went from the slightly ruined painting to the  raging, raven haired girl. I watched her kick some old desks, chairs  and boxes. She was screaming and crying as she did and though silent  as it was, I could almost hear her scream her heart out…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘SHIT!’  I watched her kick a really old desk,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘Amane...’  an old single metal toolbox,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘I…’  a box full of used paint cans,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘….absolutely…’  a chair,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘…HATE  YOU!!!’ and another desk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  took a few steps back and ended up with her back on the empty  chalkboard. She was crying freely, I could see her tears streaming  from her reddening eyes from where I stood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was astonished to learn that she wasn’t done quite yet. She closed  her left hand into a fist, and rolled right to her right and punched  the old and dusty board as hard as she could. It caused the board to  bend and break a little, but it was the sound that it had caused that  made me worry and wonder if anyone else had heard it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  somehow that concern escaped me as soon as it came. I continued to  watch her cry. Her head was leaning on the old board as she slammed  her fists over and over again, slowly loosing strength each time she  did. She slowly slumped down dragging her nails along the old board  creating the painful screeching sound that I’m sure anyone hated  hearing. A minute later, she was on the floor sitting on her legs as  she held herself up from the floor with her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was then that I thought. <em>‘I’ve  seen enough…’</em> I felt  the desperate need to comfort her. It’s was… after all… my  fault that she was crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  slowly opened the door as quietly as I could… she either ignored it  or didn’t notice and continued crying. I didn’t speak… I just  walked towards her; slow enough for her to take notice of my  presence, careful enough not to trip on anything, and quiet enough  not to cause her panic. I took a moment to look around and check the  mess that she hand made; a few of the old desks where almost broken  in half and had a lot of fragments lying around here and there, the  old toolbox had been dented, cans scattered here and there, a chair  lay on top of a broken desk with a leg broken, the easel and canvas  was spared from being hit by a few open paint tubes, and her paint  brushes some of which were broken in two when she might have stepped  on them lay here and there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then kneeled beside her and placed a hand on her shoulder and called  out her name as gentle as I could. “Nanto-san.” Her body almost  jumped in surprise when she heard my voice. She slowly turned her  head towards me to check if I was who she thought I was. Our eyes met  and my blood almost froze when I saw the feeling from her eyes turn  from hurt to rage in mere seconds. It was gut wrenching… it almost  felt like it was my body that she had kicked and punched earlier.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  shrugged off my hand and tried to stand and walk away, but I couldn’t  just let her go… “Please wait...” I took her hand pulled her  towards me. She must have been exhausted, because she fell back  towards me almost effortlessly. I immediately wrapped my arms around  her from behind so that she couldn’t make her escape. She  struggled, kicked, and even drove her elbow at my sides, but I  continued to hold her tightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  she had her voice she’d probably be screaming; “Let me go!” or  “Get you’re hands off me!” or maybe even… “I hate you!  Everything’s your fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry.” I told her, drawing out any and all remorseful feelings and  letting them out in these words. I repeated them almost like a chant,  hoping that it would soothe her anger. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a minute… she did calm down. She was still crying but had at least  stopped thrashing around, trying to free herself and hurt me in the  process. I turned her towards myself and hugged her as tightly and  gently as possible. She lost the will the stand and was completely  leaning on me for support. She cried on her hands, while griping the  vest of my uniform as her body shivered like all her warmth was being  drained from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  very sorry, Nanto-san,” I apologize as I gently brushed her hair,  trying to console her and desperately hoping she was listening to me.  “I know, we didn’t really meet in the best of terms, and at a  point, I knew that you hated me.” I felt her body stiffen and her  grip tighten hearing that. “But I didn’t know why. It tore me  apart. You wouldn’t believe how much sleep I’ve lost from  thinking too much. And now I think I do.” I could feel her tears  seeping deep into the breast part of my uniform.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  love Hikari… don’t you?” I felt one of her hands release my  uniform and watched it balled up into a fist. She pounded it on my  chest; once, twice, five… maybe ten. Each one grew weaker and  slower. Yet to me, each blow felt strong and painful. “I’m very  sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  answered by shaking her head slowly, almost pretending to just wipe  the tears out of her eyes. “You were probably thinking; that if  only I wasn’t here, you would probably have a better shot at  winning her affections.” I felt her jerk a little. <em>‘A  guilty or sad laugh’</em> was  my guesses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it’s any consolation… I think you held yourself pretty well  around Hikari, for you to have held in your love for her and your  hate towards me for this long without her suspecting… It must have  been painful to fall in love with someone who loves someone else.”  She began crying harder again. Her breaths were almost painfully  short and fast. At that moment, I felt it too… the pain of loving  someone who didn’t love you. Probably not as deeply and painfully  as the girl in my arms did, but it was there. It probably didn’t  feel that painful because, I had someone else that I also liked…  and probably, just probably… my love wasn’t as deep as hers or it  wasn’t even love at all. But I wanted to, at least if only for a  moment, show her what I felt for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  brushed her hair gently and drew it behind her ear. Doing this as I  gently poised my right hand to gently cup her face. I held her like  that for a moment, savoring how close she was to me. I took in as  much as I could; she smelled like paint, some dust, and lilac  flowers, her sad teary eyes glowed like a rainy sunset and her long  black hair was as soft and smooth as satin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  continued to move my hand lower and caressing her cheek. Taking the  time to wipe away some of her tears before leading my hand under her  chin. Gently pushing up I made her face rise to meet mine. Her eyes  then closed, probably not wanting to look at me. I leaned closer and  closer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  lips just inches away from hers. I then whispered to her; “I like  you… please… forgive me…” before capturing her lips in a kiss  and closed my eyes to savor the moment. I felt her stiffen and  struggle. But fortunately, I was stronger and was able to hold on to  her, keeping her from breaking the kiss. After a moment she stopped  struggling and allowed me to kiss her. I could taste her salty tears  as they accidentally fell in between our lips. Her lips felt a bit  dry and there was a trace of blood from what little saliva I could  get from her. I opened my eyes and saw her teary eyes closed, and the  skin around them a little red and swollen. She had an aura of  surrender. She didn’t accept my feelings; she just let me kiss her.  She didn’t return it nor did she make any attempt to stop me  anymore. She just continued to cry as I kissed her and held her in my  arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  what seemed like an eternity for me, I decided to end the kiss and  slowly broke away from her lips. She turned her head to her right and  bowed, not wanting to look at me. I gently lowered the both of us to  sit on the floor. She gave off a feeling of humiliation, as painful  as it was for me… I couldn’t help but feel that I might have  disgraced her. A kiss isn’t always just a kiss after all… and it  could have been her first, like mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry. Was that your first kiss Nanto-san?” I asked her sadly and  apologetic. She shook her head and honestly I was surprised, maybe  even a bit disappointed... It was mine, but I dared not tell her  because probably in the back of my mind I hoped that I kissed her  well enough to hide the fact that. And maybe I felt that knowing that  it was my first kiss would somehow affect her badly. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had let her go… she sat on her behind, with her legs to each side  and with one arm on the floor and the other holding the elbow of the  arm that supported her weight with her head bowed down looking at the  floor. Her tears hit the dry floor… a painful sight to watch.  Especially since I knew just how strong and proud she stood everyday…  seeing her like this just breaks me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry. I just wanted you to know how I feel…” I saw her eyes  widen when she heard me say that, but she didn’t dare look at me. I  saw her bite her lip hard enough to draw blood, some of which dripped  down onto the floor mixing with her tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not breaking it up with Hikari. I mean... I really like Hikari.” I  saw her tremble a bit. “And I have to take honor your feelings too…  to take care of her like you would and never make her cry.” I saw  the tiniest smile crept up her lip before she nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then reached for a piece of coal pastel that a few feet from her and  wrote; <em><u>“I’ll kill you  if you break her heart.”</u></em> on a piece of wood that was probably from one of the broken desks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  smiled and nervously giggled at that and said; “I promise to give  my life to you if ever I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  raised her right hand and used her pinky finger to wipe some of the  blood from her lip. She raised it in front of me and looked at me  straight in the eye. Her amber eyes stilled glowed like the dusk sun  and held a tiny bit of anger, but somehow I felt that she didn’t  hate me or at least not as much as she did earlier. Her eyes were  completely serious; I could tell… she will kill me if I break my  promise. My eyes fell on to the bloodied pinky, her hand rolled into  a fist except for the bloody finger. It was an invitation to a “pinky  swear”, a very serious one… it was a blood oath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  response I too bit my lip enough to draw some blood. I wiped it off  with my right hand and pinky, reached out and clasped her pinking  with mine. We shook them, up and down a few times before letting go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  watched her smile sadly and stand up. She wiped her tears and blood  off her face with the sleeves of her uniform before dusting herself a  bit. I stood up too, taking out a hanky from my vest pocket to wipe  the blood off my finger and lip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  turned her back at me and took a deep audible breath to calm herself.  She then proceeded to clean the place up, starting with picking up  the few things that didn’t break into two or more pieces. I decided  to help and tried to pick up whatever it was close to me. To my  surprise she comes close to me and holds my wrist just as I was to  reach for a few tubes of paint. I raised my head to look at her. She  just looked at me with a vague expression and shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can help.” I told her, but she just forced a smile and shook her  head again. She then tugged my arm, motioning towards the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you sure? If we do it together we could be done much faster.” I  told her, trying to convince her to accept my help.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she just shook her head and let go of my arm. She then picked up the  coal pastel again and a piece of the torn box that probably used to  hold the empty pain cans, and wrote something on it. She hands the  piece of the old box which said; <em><u>“Get  out already, aren’t you supposed to be somewhere else?”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  couldn’t help but smile at how dedicated she was to keeping Hikari  happy. While here I was confessing my untrue feelings to the best  friend of the girl I am dating not to mention kissing said girl. <em>‘I’m  such an idiot.’</em> I thought  as I nodded and said goodbye. To which she responded by not looking  at me and waving her hand in a way that yelled “Shoo!”. I took  one last look at this strong girl in admiring how… beautiful she  was despite everything that happened and everything that had dirtied  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was then that I thought; ‘Somehow… someday... I’ll find a way  to make her happy too.’ I turned left her alone there and headed  for the church.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  before that, I decided to take a small detour. A short trip to the  washroom and make myself a bit more presentable. I didn’t look like  myself when I looked at the mirror. My clothes were quite wrinkled,  dusty and had few drops of dry black paint or may that coal pastel…  I looked like I had been in a fight, which wasn’t that far from the  truth. I thought of going back to the horse riding club room and get  my riding uniform, but in the end I decided it was too much trouble  and headed of to the church to look for Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had passed a few students on the way, some of them wearing the  Saintly Chorus robes. They greeted me and smiled as they passed me. I  took note of the young pink haired girl that Hikari and I saw out  with Nanto-san last Saturday. I smiled thinking that I wouldn’t  have to wait for Hikari and maybe we could meet somewhere on the way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  reached the church grounds but so far no Hikari. I entered and saw  the church empty, except for one girl sitting on the church bench.  Walking towards her, I was surprised that she had not noticed my  presence. After all, the church floor does tend to make one’s feet  echo especially when it’s empty like it is now. I arrived by her  side and placed my hand on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>YAAAAAAAAAA!!!”</strong> she screamed and jumped away in surprise. I almost laughed, finding  her reaction was so cute.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari.  It’s just me” I told her. She turns to me and her eyes widen in  surprise… she had probably not expected me to visit her and neither  did I, until today. She looked at me from top to bottom. I feared  that she’d ask about my clothes being so wrinkled and dirty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  just blushed and apologized to me, squeaking in a sorrowful tone;  “I’m sorry sempai. I was deep in thought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  quite alright Hikari. I’m sorry for sneaking up on you.” I took  of my hand from her shoulder and sat myself beside her. “What were  you thinking so deeply about Hikari?” I asked as smiled at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked like she was pondering on what to say. It made me think that  it might be something she wasn’t ready to discuss with me. She  frowns a bit, maybe unconsciously. She then softly says; “It’s  nothing…” she pauses. I kept silent as I noticed her lips hanged  opened, daring to say that something in her mind. “… it’s just  that, I’ve been noticing more and more of Yaya-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Nanto-san?!’</em> My mind screamed, just because I wasn’t going after her anymore  didn’t mean I wasn’t the least bit interested to hear about her.  I listened carefully and dared not miss a word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  funny actually. We’ve been together for over a year now. But I’m  beginning to realize just how little I know about her.” I looked at  her, reading the soft sad smile on her lips and heard the lonely tone  of her voice. “This afternoon, a girl approached Yaya-chan with a  question. She asked if Yaya-chan would be willing to acknowledge her  fan club…” She paused again, the smile from her lips disappeared.  “I never realized how popular she was.” She looked down to the  floor and stared emptily at old marbled floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  made me wonder what she really was thinking. Was she starting to fall  for her best friend? Or was she jealous of her popularity...? I doubt  it though. The first one though I can relate to, I let out a smile  and patted her shoulder before jestingly saying; “Well she is quite  attractive, Hikari.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh...?”  She blushed and looked down. I could immediately tell that something  that involved the raven haired girl bothered Hikari. ‘Could she  actually be starting to have feelings for her?’ Some how that  thought scared me… more than the way Nanto-san looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you want to talk about it?” I decided to ask her out of concern,  but of what… was currently beyond my understanding. I watched as  this blonde girl’s blush grew a bit darker before she shook her  head in response. I nodded and said; “ok.” and dropped the  subject. To be honest, I was… scared of a lot of things; That  Hikari might like her best friend, that what I’ve done to Nanto-san  would be revealed to her, or that all the time I’ve wasted trying  to figure out Nanto-san had a bad effect on Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow  I managed pushed those thoughts away from my mind… We sat there in  silence, simply enjoying each other’s company. I was looking around  the church while we sat, hoping I could do something to spark a  conversation. I felt like I was being watched, I seemed to be  sensitive towards that, by someone close. I turned and saw Hikari  staring at me with a bewildered expression. “Is something wrong,  Hikari?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um…  Sempai? Why is your uniform all wrinkly and dirty?” She asked  something that I had forgotten to dread. I couldn’t very well tell  her that it was because I was trying to calm and talk to her best  friend, but at the same time I don’t want to lie to this sweet  girl. I decided to answer her more or less truthfully while sparing  some details.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…  A friend badly needed to vent out some deep and pent up emotions. I  was concerned that she might hurt herself and tried to calm her down.  I guess it turned into a little rough housing.” I told her and  tried my best to let out a small laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see…” she looked a bit worried and pointed at something at the  lower part of my vest. “Did she go to the clinic? That looks like a  quite a bit of blood?” I looked down and saw some really bad blood  stains, something I had missed seeing earlier or thought that it was  some paint. I froze for a while. To be honest, I was torn between  pretending it was just some rough housing with the other party being  ok, and just blowing off my cover of having a small confrontation  with Nanto-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was out of it for a while and it took me a few moments to realize  that Hikari had been calling for me. “Amane-sempai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…  I’m sorry Hikari... I felt a little worried that’s all.” It was  a pathetic and stupid excuse no matter how true it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  ok sempai. Do you want to check if she got to the clinic?” she  asked trying to be thoughtful of my concerns.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  smiled. Her sweetness and concern calms me down somewhat. “Thank  you, Hikari. But I don’t think she’d appreciate seeing my face  anytime soon.” I lightly laughed at that, I seriously thought it  was funny when I imagined her face seeing me checking up on her in  the clinic. Yet at the same time, I was seriously troubled and scared  of what she’d do to me if I did check up on her and she learns I  left Hikari alone…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">… Er…  it’s just too scary to imagine. “I think that she’ll be fine  though… she’s pretty strong here.” I said as I tapped the space  above my heart. It was my complement to the girl who I will now call  Yaya or Nanto-sama. I felt that I owed her a lot, so much actually  that I don’t think I can ever repay her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  couldn’t think of anything to talk about after that or maybe we  were both exhausted, I know I was… physically, mentally and maybe  even emotionally. She decided to return to the dorms and get some  rest before dinner. I on the other hand decided to check up on  Nanto-san after all, maybe even help her finish cleaning up… I  doubt that she’s finished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  art room she was in a while ago was now clean and almost empty. There  weren’t any traces of our previous transgression. The girl that I  was expecting to be there wasn’t, and seeing what the classroom  looked like now made me consider that she might have some sort of  cleaning talent too. Everything was back in place except for a few  missing desk and chairs, most likely the ones the dark haired girl  had broken. Her easel and canvas stood near an open window, covered  with a thick white sheet to protect it from dust. The floor looked  like it had been mopped and there was barely anymore dust on the  floor. I was surprised on how fast she was able to clean all that  mess. I found myself approaching the easel. I wanted to see the  angel’s painting once more. My hand was already on the sheet when I  heard someone enter the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  loud scream came after. <strong>“AH!?  SEMPAI! DON’T!” </strong>and I  found a long pink haired girl rushing and putting herself between  myself and the painting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”  was all that came out of my mouth. I recognized the girl immediately  as she was the same girl I passed earlier and the very same one with  Nanto-san almost a week ago. She was no longer in her Saintly Chorus  robe; instead she wore the freshman’s uniform. She looked at me, a  bit angry, rudely and a bit accusingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sempai!  It’s rude to look at someone’s painting without their  permission.” She scolded me making me let go of the sheet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry. I seemed to have forgotten my manners.” I apologized.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t look like she bought it as she still looked quite angry at  me. But she let me off the hook saying something nearly audible about <em>‘as long as you  understand’</em>. She picked  the canvas and easel up while it was still covered then moved it more  inside the classroom somewhere away from the windows and doors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have  you seen Nanto-sama?” I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  turned to me a little surprised. “She went back to the dorm… How  did you know she was here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  saw her walk in here earlier while I was looking for the Saintly  Chorus.” I told her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked satisfied with my answer and resumed cleaning the room a  little more. I wondered why she was cleaning up someone else’s  mess. That thought made me worry about Nanto-san a bit more. And if  anyone asked directly I wouldn’t probably be able to deny it. That  same thought also seemed to be the answer… I recalled the last  things I said to the raven haired girl before she made me leave.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  can help…’</em> I didn’t  say that because I merely could. I said it because I wanted to help  her. Maybe this girl felt the same.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can  I help?” I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">While  she continued to mop the rest of the room, she answered; “It’s  okay. I’m almost done, sempai.” Her reply sounded a bit like  Nanto-sama’s, the way how it stung and told me that she wasn’t  particularly fond of me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm…”  I absently vibrated my throat in acknowledgement to her response. I  watched her, smiling as she did her job as if she enjoyed it. I  thought; <em>‘people can’t  have everything and everyone they desire after all...’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is  something wrong sempai?” she asked pausing in her task and looking  at me curiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  smiled and replied; “I don’t think it’s anything I should worry  about anymore.” I then turned and walked towards the door, but just  before I left I turned to her again and said; “Take good care of  her, ok?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  girl turned as pink as her hair and yelled slightly; <strong>“Wha-Wha-What  are you talking about?!! Why would I want to take care of  Yaya-sempai!?”</strong> She turned  away from me with a pout. I decided to leave it at that, and get into  some fresh clothes, before someone I wouldn’t want to answer to  finds me in this blood stained uniform.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  night… I found Hikari at her usual table. She was with a few  unfamiliar Spica students, or should I say they weren’t the same  ones that usually sit beside her. But someone’s absence made me  worry more… Nanto-sama wasn’t beside her best friend for dinner.  Actually she wasn’t anywhere in the dinning hall. I wonder if  something did happen to her…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>… </u><em><u><strong>to  be continued.</strong></u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>Author’s  Notes:</strong></em> I’m actually surprised I made Amane kiss Yaya… I planned to do  that on the next chapter Amane narrates but somehow this happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anyway…  The next chapter fic would probably be in Yaya’s point of view that  or I might include a short filler in between, for a bit of comedy  after that all the drama nearly burned my heart... (I have this habit  of almost acting out what I plan to write before it get’s written.)</span></p>
