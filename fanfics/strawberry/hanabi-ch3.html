<h1>Strawberry Panic! Hanabi (part 3 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cradlerobber.html">Cradlerobber Speedo-kun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/hanabi-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>A/N: I expect there to be fears of this becoming a Mary-Sue fanfic; I am 
happy to assure you that this shall not be. I set out to write this 
fanfic as a &quot;what if&quot; for a second season, so to speak. Generally, in 
second seasons of series like Strawberry Panic!, new characters appear &#150; 
thus, in a fanfic written in the styling of a second season, a new 
character is bound to make an appearance. However, new characters never 
become the focus of a show, and, as such, neither will any non-canon 
characters presented here.

Just thought I&#39;d get that out there, especially as Mary-Sue and Gary-Lou 
fics make me feel ill.

----------

There was a flurry of introductions on the parts of Nagisa and the other 
girls, all in fairly cheerful tones. Fuyuko was quiet, inclining her 
head slightly at each new name, and ending with a repeat of her earlier 
words, &quot;I am pleased to meet your acquaintance.&quot;

Although she had stockings on, Fuyuko was wearing the summertime St. le 
Rim uniform, short sleeves at odds with her cold-weather shoes and 
nylons. A single thick braid of pale blue hair coiled over her shoulder, 
the split-ends visible against the front of her seifuku&#39;s collar. Her 
eyes held the cold, flat quality of junk-store emeralds, barely 
betraying any trace of life in the girl.

&quot;She just transferred here; she&#39;s a fifth-year.&quot; Chiyo explained, her 
voice characteristically soft, &quot;She moved in yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t we all go back to our room; I have some fresh tea-bags I 
brought with me, so we can get to know you a little over tea.&quot; Tamao 
suggested after a moment, &quot;We are blocking the hallway, after all...&quot;

&quot;No blocking corridors or doorways!&quot; Tsubomi suddenly shouted shrilly, 
and Yaya rolled her eyes from behind the girl. St. Spica&#39;s thirteenth 
rule was not one generally observed. But Tamao smiled pleasantly, &quot;Then 
we shall move along now.&quot;

Fuyuko looked uncomfortable, but as the group made their way back to 
Tamao and Nagisa&#39;s room, she followed at an acceptable distance. Upon 
reaching the room, Tamao pulled a key from her cuff, and unlocked the 
pine door. She crossed the room quickly, and firmly shut the window 
against the cooling air as the others entered the room. Nagisa retrieved 
the kettle from its storage place and went into the bathroom to fetch 
water, while Tsubomi and Yaya bounced themselves down onto Tamao&#39;s bed. 
Chiyo cheerfully opted for Nagisa&#39;s bed.

Fuyuko stood in the doorway, uncertain, before stepping inside. She 
closed the door, but remained standing, only a foot within the 
threshold.

Turning from the window, Tamao noticed this, &quot;Yukizawa, you are welcome 
to come and sit down.&quot;

Fuyuko nodded, and now stepped towards Tamao&#39;s desk, cautiously easing 
the chair from its usual spot. She sat, back straight, and avoided 
looking at the other girls. She had always hated meeting new people, and 
this time was no different. In some ways, it was more awkward than 
meeting her room-mate had been, even though that girl had very clearly 
disliked her. But in that case... well, there&#39;d only been one person. 
And that one person had already made the unilateral decision to run a 
rope across the middle of the room, complete with a faded floral sheet 
as a make-shift wall.

Her room-mate had been cold and direct. She also had not cared about any 
of Fuyuko&#39;s circumstances. This warm group, bubbling with energy, seemed 
sure to be inquisitive. She shot a veiled glance at the frog-shaped 
alarm clock sitting on Nagisa&#39;s headboard; there were still hours to go 
before lights-out.

Mismatched cups were handed out, and tea poured. Fuyuko gripped her own 
cup desperately, the heat seeping into her needy fingers. Tamao poured 
her own cup last before setting the kettle down on the window sill. As 
she settled into Nagisa&#39;s desk chair,

Yaya took a sip of her tea before looking to Fuyuko, &quot;Where did you go 
to high school before?&quot;

&quot;Keisuke Senior High School.&quot;

&quot;Oh, one of my friends from elementary school goes there... isn&#39;t it in 
Kyoto?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Yaya grinned, &quot;She always said she hated it!&quot;

Fuyuko looked away, her gaze resting on the cold panes of glass, &quot;I 
liked it...&quot;

&quot;Ah, well!&quot; Yaya started, aware of her faux pas, &quot;She&#39;s never been a 
very good student, and I don&#39;t think she even wanted to go to high 
school &#150; her dream is to become a hair dresser for celebrities.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Have you met your room-mate yet?&quot; Tamao asked, setting her teacup down 
on its saucer.

There was an audible pause, &quot;Yes, I have.&quot;

&quot;Oh, wait, have you met Chikaru yet?&quot; Nagisa burst in, nearly unsettling 
her cup in the process.

&quot;Chikaru?&quot;

Nagisa nodded enthusiastically, &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s the president of St. le 
Rim&#39;s student council! She&#39;s really, really nice.&quot;

Fuyuko shook her head, &quot;No, I have not met her.&quot;

&quot;Aww...&quot;

&quot;Oh, Nagisa, don&#39;t worry &#150; I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll have to meet her soon, she&#39;s 
a new transfer, after all.&quot; Despite Tamao&#39;s assurances, Nagisa still 
looked disappointed; to her, Chikaru was a wonderful person; for someone 
to have not met her yet was almost saddening.

&quot;She&#39;s probably been busy with student council duties, anyway &#150; I know 
that the student council has been meeting with Hikari and Amane almost 
non-stop.&quot; Yaya said.

&quot;Who is the student council president from St. Spica now, anyway?&quot; Tamao 
asked, looking up from Nagisa.

&quot;Mm, some girl named Kitagawa Yurika... I don&#39;t really know who she is, 
other than that she&#39;s a sixth year. Supposedly the Sister is fond of 
her. What about yours[Miyuki is gone, after all...&quot;

&quot;Moriyama Mami. I&#39;m actually not sure who she is, either.&quot; Tamao 
admitted sheepishly.

&quot;Oh, we&#39;ll probably meet them at some point, since Hikari will know her 
now.&quot; Yaya turned to Fuyuko again, &quot;Hikari is my room-mate &#150; she&#39;s half 
of the Etoile along with Amane, a sixth year. The Etoile is sort of 
like... well...&quot; She paused, thinking hard, &quot;I guess the best way to 
describe it is that they&#39;re like the king and queen of the school.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Another monosyllabic answer from the unfamiliar girl. She looked 
at the clock again &#150; barely ten minutes had crawled by. She swirled her 
tea around the cup, trying to think of a reason to excuse herself. They 
were too nice &#150; it was impossible to depart rudely.

&quot;I need to put sheets on my bed.&quot; She said suddenly, blinking in 
surprise at her own words. The conversation had progressed during her 
rapid thoughts, and now the other girls halted their words, looking in 
slight surprise at the abrupt utterance. She stood up, and set her 
half-full teacup down on the desk behind her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I need to put 
the sheets on my bed.&quot;

Yaya filled the brief silence, &quot;Well, that&#39;s understandable &#150; but feel 
free to come see any of us any time. I live in Spica 112; you should 
meet my room-mate sometime.&quot;

&quot;Ah, thank you.&quot; She forced a half-hearted smile, and bowed, &quot;Thank you 
for the tea.&quot; The door creaked open in her unsteady hands, and she 
closed it too loudly. The thud seemed to echo in her mind, and she 
flinched against it.

When she returned to her own room, she had to open the door carefully. 
One corner of the sheet was pinned to the back of the door, and it 
drooped as she swung the door inwards. Haruhime was sprawled on her bed, 
cellphone firmly in hand. An irritated look entered her features upon 
Fuyuko&#39;s entry, but she continued her rapid-fire conversation. It seemed 
she was talking to her boyfriend.

Fuyuko ducked under the &quot;wall&quot;, and made her way in the semi-darkness to 
her bed. As she flopped onto the bed, a picture frame poked her from 
beneath the sheets.
&quot;She&#39;s very quiet.&quot;

It was an innocent remark, made after the door&#39;s noise disappeared. 
There were nods of ascent in response.

&quot;She&#39;s your cousin?&quot; Tsubomi inquired of Chiyo.

&quot;Yes, a second-cousin. But I don&#39;t really know her well; the last time I 
saw her I was eight.&quot;

&quot;Well, she&#39;s probably shy... it&#39;s a bit awkward to transfer in as a 
fifth year. Hikari was really quiet when she first transferred.&quot; Yaya 
said thoughtfully.

&quot;She&#39;s still quiet!&quot; Tsubomi interjected.

&quot;Ah, true, but she was even more quiet, if you can believe it. She&#39;s 
actually less shy since becoming Etoile...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just because she has to be.&quot; Tsubomi crossed her arms and 
frowned pointedly, signifying that she, at least, felt the conversation 
was over. Yaya rolled her eyes and didn&#39;t bother to argue any further, 
sensing the futility in doing so. She turned her attention back to 
Chiyo, &quot;Do you know why she transferred?&quot;

The younger girl shook her head, &quot;No, I don&#39;t. My mother&#39;s cousin just 
called up one day and asked my mother is the schools here at Astraea 
were any good, and then a few weeks later she called again to say Fuyuko 
was transferring to le Rim.&quot;

&quot;Huh. I wonder why, then...&quot;

The girls chatted further, although the topic soon changed to more 
everyday things, ranging from complaints regarding certain classes to 
any room changes classmates had made between the school years. Finally, 
Yaya stood up with a sigh, &quot;I have to go &#150; it&#39;ll be lights out soon, and 
I know Hikari forgot to bring her key when she left earlier.&quot;

&quot;Oh! I should go too.&quot; Tsubomi said, leaping up, &quot;Thanks for the tea, 
Tamao.&quot; She respectfully handed her floral-print cup to Tamao, who set 
it with the rest of the empty cups.

&quot;Your welcome; it was nice to have all of you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll walk you back to your room, Chiyo.&quot; Nagisa offered, prompting a 
blush and grateful stuttering on the other girl&#39;s part.

With the room empty, Tamao carried the cups into the bathroom. She stood 
by the sink, hot water running and fogging the dusty mirror. She briefly 
wondered how the mirror had gotten so dusty &#150; they hadn&#39;t been gone from 
school too long now. As she began to roll up her sleeves for the task 
ahead of her, she caught sight of a ribbon on the floor by the cabinet. 
She leaned down, and picked it up; it was the ribbon she&#39;d pulled from 
Nagisa&#39;s hair on that early spring morning. She gripped it for a moment, 
staring.

In the newly humid air, she sighed.</pre>
