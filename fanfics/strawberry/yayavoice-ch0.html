<p>Yaya: The angel wasn’t mine.</p>
<p>It's  been over a week since Hikari and I made up. Maybe I should say that  it’s been over a week since she had forgiven me. It was ok at first…  but after a few days, I just felt like skipping classes and choir  practice. I wasn't in the mood to be there. I still felt very guilty  about what I've done to Hikari. She’s has never brought it up, but I  know things have changed since then…</p>
<p>And something else happened…</p>
<p>Have I been avoiding her? ...</p>
<p>Yeah...  I guess have. It’s almost a miracle that I have managed to avoid her  for this long, seeing that we live in the same room.</p>
<p>It’s just  that seeing her… is more than enough to make my heart race painfully.  Ever since I heard her confess her feelings to Amane-san that night,  even though she said it in her sleep… even though she didn’t know that  she said it… It was painful to hear.</p>
<p>So painful that... I haven’t  spoken to her in days, in fact… I haven’t spoken in days. If someone  talked to me, I more or less ignored them. When ordering food, I just  pointed. I haven’t attended class so that I don’t have to see Hikari.</p>
<p>No talking… No singing… No humming… Nothing… until I realized… I couldn’t… for some odd reason… I’ve lost my voice.</p>
<p>I  decided to see the nurse about it during class hours, since I was  skipping class already. She tells me that she found nothing wrong with  my vocal cords; it didn’t look swollen or wounded. Hearing that just  made me feel bad… or maybe I should say worse. What if it’s a new  disease or something? Is my luck really that bad now? She then told me  that she would try to get a hold of a good doctor in the city for me.</p>
<p>I  had to use a piece of paper and pen to ask the nurse not to tell anyone  else about it. I didn't want them to worry, especially Hikari. She  agreed to keep it confidential, and that she will only discuss it with  the doctor hopefully to cure whatever it is that I have. But then she  suggested that I would need to tell the teachers and everyone else  something more or less believable.</p>
<p>She looked at me for a bit  before telling me that she would write a letter for me, at least  something to show everyone to explain why I couldn’t speak. I found  myself smiling at her kind offer and nodded. She then said that I could  pick up tomorrow. I thanked her the best way I could before I left the  school’s infirmary.</p>
<p>I then headed to the school's shop to pick up  a new notebook, I would need it for a while and it seemed the logical  thing to do. I can’t avoid communication forever just because I don’t  have my voice. Looking back a few years… I regret not learning sign  language when I had the chance. But then again, there probably aren’t  many here that do know how. I then headed back to the dorm room that  Hikari and I shared. Classes were still on, so it was no surprise that  the room was empty. I decided to take that chance to take a shower.</p>
<p>As  the lukewarm water pelted on my body, I could feel goose-bumps rising  as the water hit my skin. My long black hair began to stick to me, and  ended up slightly tangled when I tried to brush it with my fingers. I  began singing... but then no sound came out. I released a quiet sigh,  in disappointment. I must have been there for a while; the water was  beginning to feel cold on my skin. I then heard a very familiar soft  yet high pitched voice along with a loud knock on the bathroom door.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Yaya-chan! Are you okay?&quot;</strong> her voice slowly got louder after each call and she seemed really  worried. And why wouldn’t she be? I have been avoiding her for days. It  won’t be easy, but I got to brave it no matter how painful it is to  look at her… I’m still her friend and I shouldn’t make her worry about  me. I had better get out and explain to her... more or less what had  happened to me.</p>
<p>I turned off the shower, causing the knocking to  stop. But since I wasn't answering or should I say couldn't answer she  still called out my name... with the same worried tone. I hurried to  get out so I barely managed to dry myself and wore a bathrobe, then  placed the towel around my hair. I grabbed hold of the door knob, took  a deep breath and told myself. ‘I can do this!’</p>
<p>I exited the  bathroom, with the best smile I could fake and waved my hand at her  slightly. I was greeted at the sight of my roommate, her long blond  hair slightly wet of what I would guess to be her sweat. Soft blue  eyes, gazed at me with a worried glow.</p>
<p>My heart ached just looking at her, I felt like crying but…</p>
<p>&quot;Yaya-chan?  Are you okay? Are you still mad?&quot; She bombarded me with questions I  could not answer immediately. I felt flustered and a bit confused. Here  I am, facing the one person I had worked so hard to avoid for days…  wow…I feel really bad.</p>
<p>She asked question after question not  bothering to wait for an answer. I had to place my fingers on her lips  to keep her quiet for a moment, which caused her to blush a bit and  move away… I guess things really have changed. Sure she did that before  too… only she didn’t have that scared look in her eyes before.</p>
<p>I moved to my table, where I had place the new notebook I had bought earlier. I wrote <em><u>'Welcome back Hikari-chan! How was your day?'</u></em> on a page, showed it to her and forced myself to smile.</p>
<p>She  read what I wrote and looked quite irritated. &quot;Yaya-chan! What’s  wrong?! Why have you been skipping class and practice?&quot; I could see  tears beginning to form in her eyes. &quot;Why have you been avoiding me?  You sleep early, you eat early, you skipped class and choir!&quot; She  looked angry, but cute and... Strong.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Why aren't you saying anything?!&quot;</strong> She yelled… angrily… a first… and it’s my fault.</p>
<p>I  could only look at her, saddened, hurt and maybe even scared... and I  couldn't explain myself very well, even more so not in this state. But  I had to be strong, I can’t breakdown. I fought myself to hold back my  tears… for Hikari. I opened my mouth, but nothing formed. I could only  hold my throat gently and look at her with my slightly watery eyes,  hoping she would understand.</p>
<p>She stared at me for a moment; her  eyes sad, angry, nervous and ready to leak out tears. I could then see  her eyes gaze down at my mouth, then to my hand over my throat. Her  eyes widened with worry and apology. &quot;Yaya-chan?!&quot; She cried out  worriedly.</p>
<p>I wrote on the notebook again. <em><u>'I'm sorry I worried you, Hikari. I seem to have lost my voice. Ha Ha'</u></em> I smiled and acted like I was laughing but the tears I was fighting to  hold back were already falling from my eyes, I know I might have  sounded and looked stupid right now… but I didn't want Hikari to worry  too much about me. It’s supposed to be the other way around.</p>
<p>She  began shaking; her eyes fell to the floor... I could see her tears  falling, flowing more than mine. I then thought of placing a hand on  her shoulder to try to comfort her… but stopped myself… I don’t have  the right to hold her. But to my surprise Hikari suddenly jumped at me,  locking me into a tight embrace, I lost balance and we fell onto my  bed. To my disappointment nothing came out when tried to I cry out in  surprise. Hikari began crying on my chest, clutching the back of my  bathrobe tightly. I felt so helpless... I couldn’t even return the hug  she was giving me… no matter how much I wanted to… Instead my hands  rested lightly on her shoulders, where they coincidentally fell when we  landed on my bed. It took a lot of effort to take my hands off her, and  wipe my eyes of the sight blurring tears.</p>
<p>In between the crying  she began to apologize. &quot;I'm sorry Yaya-chan. I thought you were upset  with me.&quot; she looked up to my face, eyes still in tears. I picked up  the notebook which had fallen nearly beside my head. I wrote: <em><u>'It's alright Hikari. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I just actually found out myself.'</u></em> and showed it to her. That sentence felt like such a big lie, literally its true… but that wasn’t why I was avoiding her.</p>
<p>She  gave me a soft yet sad smile before she rolled to my side ending the  hug, I felt disappointed and relieved at the same time… of course I  didn't let it show. &quot;So... what happened to your voice?&quot; she asked as  she sat up and dried her tears with the sleeves of her uniform slowly  recomposing herself. I then wrote about going to the nurse and a lie  about having some problem with my throat that they don’t have a  medication for yet, and that it might be a while before I can get my  voice back. &quot;That's sounds awful...&quot; I could see tears daring to fall  from her eyes again. I slipped up more or less… it wasn’t the truth…  but it was close.</p>
<p><em><u>'I'll just have to find something else I'm good at! Right?'</u></em> meaning it about the choir that I cannot be a part of at my state. I  forced a smile… I loved singing… I loved singing with Hikari… but now I  can’t, for other reasons besides not having my voice. I could see her  look down at the floor again. I have to say something to change the  atmosphere. I scribbled <em><u>'For now we'll just have to learn hand signals or else I'll be wasting too much paper! HAHA'</u></em> I tried to write it as humorous as possible, I just can't stand seeing her sad.</p>
<p>She  could only give me a weak smile and a nod. I patted her hand lightly,  almost as if to tell her that ‘things would work out somehow’. I stood  up, deciding to finish getting dry and changing, I was getting cold. I  could feel Hikari watching me, not that I minded. I turned to her; she  seemed lost in thought for a while... She was still looking at me even  after had finished changing. I scribbled down <em><u>'Did you enjoy my strip show?'</u></em> on the note book and showed it to her with a grin on my face. It was an  instinctual prank one of many I had played on her to show her cute  side. ... Instinct... I have to learn to control that more.</p>
<p>She instantly blushed, very cutely might I add. <strong>&quot;YAYA-CHAN!&quot;</strong> she pouted, again I must say cutely. &quot;Stop teasing me!&quot; She seemed  lightly annoyed. I scribbled down an apology and an excuse about  lighting up the mood. She seemed to have bought it for now. I laughed  inside… relieved that somehow I can probably keep on living with her  without exposing myself. Though the thought of asking for a room change  did cross my mind… but that would be equivalent to ending our  friendship. And I didn’t want that.</p>
<p>&quot;We should tell the teachers  about it.&quot; She stood up and was ready to pull me out of the room. I  wrote something about the nurse preparing a note for me to show the  teachers tomorrow. She read it and nodded. She sat on my bed and played  with her legs. I sat down as well and just looked around the room. It's  so boring not to be able to say anything not to mention awkward. And my  not being able to speak seems to make Hikari rather nervous around me.  But then again I can think of a lot of reasons why she would be.</p>
<p>Minutes  passed and my eyes just happened to wander around the room. I then saw  the time and remembered that it was about time for Amane-san's riding  practice. I know she's a diligent watcher of her horse-riding, because  of her feelings for Amane-san. Or maybe she was really just watching  Amane-san. It pained me to even think of telling her about it... But it  was also painful seeing her.</p>
<p>I looked at her... and decided: It  was what's best for her. I patted her shoulder and pointed at the  clock; she remembered and almost ran out of the room instantly yelling  &quot;Ah! Amane-sempai!” But as she opened the door, she stopped for a  moment and asked &quot;Will you be okay?&quot; she looked at me quite worried  again. I wonder if I will regret this… I nodded and smiled, motioning  my hand playfully as if to shoo a little bird. She then smiled, said  “I’ll see you later then.” and left, closing the door behind her.</p>
<p>I  released a deep silent sigh and dropped on to the bed. Tears came  streaming from my eyes which I immediately wiped away and tried to hold  the rest back, in case Hikari decided to come and stay with me. Minutes  passed and so did my wishful thinking. I decided to go to out; maybe  visit the library for a while hoping for something to occupy my time,  or maybe just have early dinner and go to bed.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari: Keeping our bonds.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had been running all over today, Yaya-chan wasn’t anywhere I  thought she’d be. I had checked the library, the fountain, the  church, the church’s garden… I hope nothing has happened to her.  I was forced to give up for today… I decided to head back to our  room and freshen up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was surprised to hear the shower running. Yaya-chan is here. I  quickly ran to shower door, jiggled the doorknob to open it but it  was locked. We don’t usually do that. I then knocked and called out  to her. “Yaya-chan! Yaya-chan!” seconds later, I hear the water  stopping but she didn’t answer my call. I could feel my heart  skipping beats, but pumping rather hardly. “Yaya-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  opened the door, revealing herself wearing her white bathrobe and  kept her wet black hair wrapped with a towel. She just smiled at me  while her amber eyes looked like they were shaking almost fearful,  but it barely registered in my mind. &quot;Yaya-chan? Are you okay?  Are you still mad?&quot; I asked her question after question, panic  and worry had gotten the best of me... I didn’t even wait try to  wait for her to answer. She looked panicked for a moment, but then  she placed a finger on my lips. I instantly blushed, stopped talking  and took a step back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  just looked at me, sadly, before moving to her desk and picking up a  notebook. She wrote something, showed it to me and smiled. It said: <u><em>'Welcome back Hikari-chan! How was your day?'</em></u> I felt  angry, I didn’t really understand why? Was she still so upset that  she’s not talking to me anymore? I thought we were through with  that…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Yaya-chan!  What’s wrong?! Why have you been skipping class and practice?&quot;  My vision was getting blurry as I fought back the tears. &quot;Why  have you been avoiding me? You sleep early, you eat early, you  skipped class and choir!&quot; I gave her a moment to answer, but she  just looked at me… It made me angry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>&quot;Why  aren't you saying anything?!&quot;</strong> I yelled... I fought the urge  to clear my throat. I just stared at her, mixed feelings rushing in  me. I stared at her, waiting for her to say something. I saw her  moving her lips, but I heard nothing. Her hand moved up to touch her  lips and then her neck. Her eyes never once left its lock from mine.  I slowly glanced down to her neck, trying to make sense of it. Then  it hit me… the writing, the silent treatment… she’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-chan?!”  I cried out worriedly hoping it was one of her jokes, a cruel joke  that I’ll forgive if she stopped now. But sadly she just wrote on  her notebook again. <u><em>'I'm sorry I worried you, Hikari. I seem to  have lost my voice. Ha Ha'</em></u> she acted like she was laughing,  but I could see the tears that began flowing from her eyes almost as  fast as mine. I looked down… trying to absorb everything. My tears  began to wet the floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Without  really thinking, leaped at her and held onto her tight. We fell on  her bed and I just cried on her chest. I didn’t know how long I  cried. I was feeling guilty, for lashing out at her like I did. I  made Yaya-chan cry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan  didn’t hug me like she usually does, she just lightly held my  shoulders… I must have hurt her too. Feeling her hands move, I  slowly looked up a little to see that she was wiping her tears. “I’m  sorry Yaya-chan. I thought you were still upset with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  just looked at me and wrote something again. <u><em>It's alright  Hikari. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I just actually found out  myself.</em></u>' I couldn’t help but smile, when she forgave me and  apologized as well. I rolled off her, and tried to dry my tears. I  felt relieved somehow, that we somehow resolved that issue without it  getting any worse. “So… what happened to your voice?” I asked.  She answered it in writing; telling me that she had seen the nurse  about it, that so far she couldn’t medicate her yet and that it  might be a while for her voice to return. “That sounds awful…”  was all I could say. She just smiled and wrote that she’ll just  have to live with it for a while, do something else she was good at  and maybe even learn sign language so as not to waste too much paper…  That’s Yaya-chan alright. I could only give her a weak smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then stood and dried off. I just watched her as she took her robe off  and change into something homey casual. I didn’t really intend to  stare. I was lost in thought, I was admiring how strong Yaya-chan is.  She was dealing with her problems alone. I couldn’t possibly do  that in my case. I would probably be crying for weeks if I lost my  voice… but I know Yaya-chan would be there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Out  of nowhere, Yaya-chan places the note book in front of my eyes.  Written down was something that made me blush like mad. <u><em>‘Did  you enjoy my strip show?’</em></u> I read and looked at her, with a  wide grin on her face. <strong>“YAYA-CHAN!” </strong>I couldn’t help but  yell at her. “Stop teasing me!” Yaya-chan quickly apologized,  saying that she was just trying to lighten us both up. So I dropped  it, and forgave her like I always do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then realized that we should tell the teachers about it. I told her  that and was ready to pull her out of the door with me. But she  stopped me, telling me that the nurse was writing her a letter for  that tomorrow. I guess she really had thought this out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  just sat on her bed for a while. If we wanted to talk about  something, there was a barrier for her to do so right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m  still at shock about Yaya-chan loosing her voice. She was the Choir’s  Ace, everyone loved her singing. She must have been so depressed  loosing it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘I’m  sorry I didn’t notice Yaya-chan…’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wallowed in pity and self annoyance in not being able to do something  for Yaya-chan after all she’s done for me since the day we meet.  She’s kept me company, cheered me up, got me into the choir, sang  songs with me, and protected me, and even helped me with  Amane-sempai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  had our differences every now and again, mostly small things, and  Yaya-chan always found a way to make things right…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Almost…  but it was only that one time… I recalled that night, I was happy  to be home.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  thank Yaya-chan for helping me so much that day, I was going to give  her a Sakura colored sea shell. But then Yaya-chan acted differently  then… stole my first kiss and started touching me in weird places.  I remembered pushing her hard and crying, even when she finally  realized what she had done I was still too shocked to forgive her.  But we got thru that. And now that Yaya-chan lost her voice and I  thought that she was still beating herself up for that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was so lost in thought that I didn’t notice the time. I was  surprised to feel Yaya-chan tapping my shoulder and motioning for me  to look at the clock. It was 4:15. “Amane-sempai!!” I yelled and  almost bolted out of the room. But something stopped me… I had just  found Yaya-chan… I found out that she’s suffering… I shouldn’t  be leaving her alone right now!.. But I really want to see  Amane-sempai. I turned to her, half worried about her and half  pleading that she’ll make me go. “Will you be ok?” I asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  only paused for a second, smiled and waved her hand at me playfully  motioning for me to go already. I smiled thanking her for making that  decision for me. Yaya-chan is so strong, I wish I could be more like  her. I can’t even imagine what my life would have been here if I  had not met her that day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  see you later then.” Without a second thought and with a warming  heart. I raced out of the dorm room quickly closing the door behind  me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  don’t usually run in the halls, it’s unladylike and I know it’s  not allowed but I had to hurry. Fortunately enough I did not get  caught by the sister in charge nor did I run in to anyone and cause  them trouble. I quickly headed for the field where Amane-sempai  practices her riding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had arrived to see that she was still practicing. For a moment there  I thought I was going to be too late. As I was catching my breath I  noticed that she was looking at me. I could feel my cheeks instantly  burn up, I know that they were already red from all the running I had  done this afternoon. I smiled and gave her a soft wave. She smiled  and nodded in acknowledgement. I felt slightly disappointed that she  didn’t wave back, but then that would probably cause the other  girls to squeal louder, so it was ok. I watched her road … her  beautiful crimson eyes concentrated on the horse would travel, her  short blue hair waving with the wind. The determined look on her face  and the slight blush she held, which reminded me of the time she said  she was embarrassed to be watched by so many that she had a hard time  practicing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  remainder of her practice lasted for about half an hour, before she  headed to the stables with her horse. The rest her fans began  returning to the dorm or began heading to their homes. I had stayed  there, sitting under the tree where we first talked. I remember that  day so clearly…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was disheartened… after the screw up I had caused during the  congratulations ceremony for Amane-sempai. I was so nervous that I  had sung ahead of everyone… even before the song began. I was so  embarrassed and I felt like quitting the Saintly Chorus, our choir…  I had told Yaya-chan that. She tried her best to cheer me up, saying  that there are other chances for me to sing for Amane-sempai. But I  felt so bad that I couldn’t sleep. I walked outside that night, and  prayed at the Maria statue by the small fountain. Eventually I fell  asleep in the cold of the night. When I woke up it was near dawn. I  found myself walking to horse riding field, maybe partially hoping  Amane-sempai was there. I began singing; using my memory of her  riding here during her practices to picture she was there. Imagine my  surprise when Amane-sempai herself came up to me riding her horse. We  talked a while and she had cheered me up... she even lent me her  Jacket. I smiled at the good memory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minutes  later I smiled to see Amane-sempai as she walked up to me from the  stables. “Hello Hikari.” She greeted and climbed off the white  fence that usually kept the horses in; with that soft smile that just  made me smile and warm up inside. She then sat beside me and asked  “Is something wrong Hikari?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  just looked at her slightly confused. “You’ve been acting a  little off. Is Nanto-san still avoiding you?” Amane-sempai was  observant or I just couldn’t hide these things. I had told her  about the Yaya-chan avoiding me and everyone days ago. I decided to  tell her about what happened earlier; how I found Yaya-chan back in  our room, how I got a bit mad at her for avoiding me and about her  loosing her voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see…” she looked at the sky for a while, thinking about what to  say. She then looks at me and gives me her opinion. “I’m guessing  that she’s been avoiding you and everyone because she feels awkward  about loosing her voice.” I hoped it was that simple. I just nodded  and tried to ponder about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  next thing she said really surprised me. “Or maybe she’s in love  with someone and is trying to make sense of her feelings. Then she  lost her voice.” I never would have guessed that. I nearly screamed  when I heard it. “That can’t be!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  thought that there was no way that she wouldn’t tell me if she was.  She’s my best friend, I’m her best friend. We know each other  that deeply right? She would right? My mind flashed the memory of her  kissing me that night I returned from my date with Amane-sempai. I  began thinking that maybe Amane-sempai was right, and maybe Yaya-chan  was so dazed that she kissed me that night, maybe imagining I was  that girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane-sempai  began giggling. I just stared at her dumbfounded. “I’m sorry  Hikari. I was just teasing you.” Teasing? … I haven’t told  Amane about that night. I figured it was a mistake between friends,  no one really needed to know about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  almost jumped in surprise when I felt her hand on my shoulder. I  looked at her, she just smiled at me. “Are you still worried about  her?” she asked. I nodded. “I think you should just give her time  Hikari. She probably upset without her voice and avoided you and  everyone because she didn’t want to take out any frustration she  had on you or anyone else and maybe was hoping that her voice would  come back soon. Soon enough that no one even needed to know she lost  it in the first place. I believe you told me that she has a  reputation of being the choir’s ace? ” I nodded again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hearing  Amane-sempai’s insight somehow made me feel better. I smiled and  nodded. “I guess so. Thank you Amane-sempai.” I couldn’t help  but admire Amane-sempai more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then stood and offered me her hand. “It’s getting dark, we should  get back. It should be near dinner time when we get back to the dorm  building.” I nodded and took her hand; she then gently helped me up  from where I had comfortably sat. We then headed back to the dorm  together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On  the way back, I was enjoying the moment that I was with Amane-sempai.  My eyes mostly focused on the ground, keeping my feet walking at the  pace and direction hers went. To my surprised she stopped. I looked  up and our eyes met. “Hikari?” I didn’t understand why, but I  suddenly felt nervous that I stuttered a “Y-yes?” in reply. She  just smiled at me, with the same gentle eyes she always held.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would  you like me to talk to her?” She asked. I let out a soft, surprised  and confused “huh?” The question barely registered so she asked  again. “Would you like me to talk to her?” I just stared at her  for a moment taking a second or two to realize she was referring to  Yaya-chan, I was considering if I should let Amane-sempai try to find  out what I can’t. I thought to myself, that if I can’t understand  Yaya-chan… who can? I was going to say no, but for some reason… I  nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  smiled “Okay. I’ll talk to her when I get the chance.” There  was a sad and worried glint in her eyes when she said that. I felt  her hands on my shoulders, gently squeezing, that somehow helped me  relax. “Thank you! Amane-sempai.” I meant it. I was at a lost of  what to do for Yaya-chan, so much that even if they weren’t friends  I thought that Amane-sempai could do a better job at helping  Yaya-chan than I could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane-sempai  just kept on smiling and said that she was glad to help. We then  headed into the dorm. It was nearing dinner time and both of us  needed to wash up. We said our goodbyes and goodnight incase we  failed to see each other later. I headed back to our room, wondering  if Yaya-chan was doing ok since I left her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  I entered the room I was surprised to find the room without the  lights on, I was even more surprised to find Yaya-chan already  sleeping on her bed. But I decided to make sure that she wasn’t  just taking a nap. I sat beside her, lightly rubbed her shoulder and  called to her softly. “Yaya-chan? Yaya-chan?...” She shifted a  little to shrug off my hand. I looked at her and noticed the small  water stains on her pillow, I realized that she had been crying. Was  she crying when I left? Or was she crying in her sleep… now I feel  guilty for leaving her a while ago. I then saw her lips move as if  mumbling something in her sleep, but I’m not good at reading lips  so I had no idea what she just said. I didn’t try to wake her up  after that, she really must have been depressed and maybe all that  hiding made her tired.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  did what was routine for me after that, took a nice warm bath, got  into a clean uniform after placing the dirty one into the our  laundry. Before heading down to have dinner with everyone, go back to  our room and do my homework before bed. I was hoping that Yaya-chan  would wake up while I was bathing, that way we could eat together  again and maybe talk a bit. But sadly that didn’t happen. I suppose  there would be another chance tomorrow; after all she didn’t hide  this time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  woke up just about the same time I do every morning. Yaya-chan wasn’t  on her bed, that wasn’t unusual. She tends to wake up earlier than  I do, and is usually prepared to school or is in the shower when I  wake up. But like the past few days, today was different. I wonder if  she’s still upset. I know we made up already, and she says she’ll  be back in class today. Where could she be?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  decided to get ready for school first. I showered and changed into my  school uniform. I took the time to check myself at the mirror, before  going out the door and heading to the dining hall. Maybe Yaya-chan  would be there. At least that’s what I hoped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  arrive at the dining hall. The room was filled with students from all  three schools… but no Yaya-chan. Our usual seats are still empty. I  frowned; I was worried about Yaya-chan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  thoughts were so filled with Yaya-chan that I failed to notice  someone sitting beside me as I ate. Only was my train of thought  broken when a familiar voice called me, the one voice that can cause  my body to feel warm, tingly, and very happy. I turned and smiled to  see Amane-sempai. “Amane-sempai! Good Morning!” I could feel  myself blushing as I smiled and looked at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good  Morning, Hikari.” She smiled at me, which made me feel even warmer.  I felt a little embarrassed that I didn’t notice her sit beside me.  She smiled nodded and ate breakfast. I did too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was busy eating my omelet and trying to keep my face from blushing  any harder when she called my attention. “Hikari?” I had a spoon  in my mouth as I turned to her. I let out a small “Hmm?” to  acknowledge her call.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would  you like to go out again this weekend?” My eyes open wide and I  could feel my smile threatening to spill the food I had just placed  into my mouth. I chewed and swallowed… almost choking. And answered  rather excitedly “I’d love too!” She smiled at me and nodded.  She then tells me that she’ll pick me up in my dorm room at 8 am. I  smiled and nodded shyly to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then gets up as she finished her breakfast, and takes her tray with  her. “I have to take care of Star Bright, so I’ll see you later,  Hikari.” I nodded to her with the same shy smile. She smiled as  well before turning and heading to have her dishes cleaned. I just  watched her till she had left the dining room. I quite sure I was  already dreaming of my date with her. Had it not been for  Tsubomi-chan I wouldn’t have realized that I was day dreaming  instead of eating. I inwardly laughed at her comment about me  becoming as dazed as Yaya-chan. Yaya-chan isn’t like that. … is  she?</span></p>
