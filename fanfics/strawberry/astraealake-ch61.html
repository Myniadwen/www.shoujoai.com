<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I dislike  writing fluffy happiness, it always makes me feel like I'm doing  something wrong. More than that, I often am doing something wrong. But  they can't be miserable all the time, either, so... enjoy?</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But it wouldn't be me without some good, healthy angst. That wouldn't change even if I did own Strawberry Panic.</span></p>

Momomi sat on Kaname’s bed, hugging her knees and smiling. “So, what’s on the agenda today?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shrugged. “Biology, I guess.” She walked over to their desk, rooting  through the books and locating the relevant ones. “Remember, we have to  work hard. This exam is no joke.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, I know.” Momomi pouted. “I do have a half-decent memory, you know. You don’t have to keep on reminding me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some  things bear repeating, that’s all,” Kaname explained, walking back and  sitting on the bed. “This is something I say for myself, as well.” She  touched the floor with her legs, then kicked out slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Momomi allowed her legs to fall sideways, resting on the covers and  brushing Kaname gently. She rested her chin on her hands and smiled.  “This really is something that can make even you serious, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Even for me, it’s not a negotiable thing, no. Like I said before, this is something that has to be done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned thoughtfully. “You do work surprisingly hard from time to time, don’t you? I didn’t know you had it in you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you. This is a matter where I have no choice.” Kaname closed her  eyes. “In case you’ve forgotten, I came from there. When I put my mind  to it, my focus can be ferocious. That doesn’t have anything to do with  how lazy I am the rest of the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. That’s pretty admirable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have it too, if you can work so damn hard on that waste-of-time script,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not a waste of time, exactly. I’ll be getting something out of it.”  Momomi leaned forwards, taking Kaname’s arm and looking up at her with  cunning eyes. “So, Kaname, are you going to audition for a part in my  opus?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not interested,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not? You’d  probably be a good actor. If you speak like you do normally, that’d be  fine in itself… you have a theatrical mind. And a great talent for  improvisation, even if it’s me saying that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted.  “What’s that got to do with anything? You couldn’t force me on a stage  with a crowbar. Standing up there and shouting at everyone, extra work  and no real gain, I don’t give a damn. You can do what you like. But it  doesn’t interest me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not even for the two of us?” Momomi asked. “This would be a good way to gain popularity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not interested in that, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. So you’d rather stay like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is fine,” Kaname snapped. “I’ve stayed like this ever since I’ve been here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shook her head. “This is fine if you have to be this way. But we both  have the potential to be more than this. You know that. Do you like  being an outcast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t really care.” Kaname folded her arms  defiantly. “All that would take a lot of effort, and there’s no gain  for me at the end either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted, pulling her hand away  and folding them together. “No gain? Well, quite part from people not  hating us, we’d be able to make use of them. Didn’t you hear what Shion  said?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion is Shion. She lives in her own world anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still,  she’s right about this. And I, for one, could do a lot better than her.  I’m sure of it.” Momomi looked away thoughtfully. “She’s a thinking  person, but she dislikes centre-stage. That’s where we’re different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything  the majority of this school has to give isn’t anything I’m interested  in,” Kaname repeated. “To be honest, I prefer things this way. It’s  quiet and no one bothers us. That’s fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, <em>I </em>don’t  think so. I don’t know about you.” Momomi glowered. “I lost my reason  to act like that when my father let me be. Since then, I’ve pretty much  been waiting for a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good for you. But I’ve thought about  that, and I don’t want to get involved.” Kaname closed the Biology  book, dropping all pretence of work, and glared at her. “Didn’t you  hear Amane? Do you want to be the one going through that crap?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  actually. I can handle those situations.” Momomi shook her head.  “Besides, aren’t you the one who poured scorn on her for complaining  about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just because I think someone like her should be  able to deal with it, doesn’t mean I want to deal with it myself,”  Kaname replied. “That’s just bloody sensible. We’re not alike in that  respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And so you’re less able to deal with it than she  is? Is that it?” Momomi shook her head. “I never thought I’d hear you  say she was your better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Now you’re just trying to provoke me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s working, isn’t it?” Momomi replied, with affected carelessness.  “More seriously, though, I’m interested in how you answer that  question. Because I already know you can deal with these things just as  well as her. Probably better than she does.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname pursed her  lips irritably. “I told you. I could care less whether I have the  ability or not, I’m not inclined to face that stuff. Normal people  annoy me and just the shit I get from you and Amane is bad enough-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “So that’s my fault now, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, how isn’t it? You’re the one who provoked them by attention whoring with Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scowled. “You would do very well to take that back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared at her, red eyes unrelenting. “Well, that’s the way it is, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not responsible for their actions, I didn’t ask for them to do that,” Momomi retorted, her voice low and cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You knew what was going to happen. That was the point of the exercise!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  should I let that knowledge control me? Isn’t that just sad, to  constrain myself because of them?” Momomi glowered back. “If you ask  me, to act one way or another as a result of them would be the actions  of a very weak person. Isn’t that acknowledgement enough of their power  over you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing so dramatic. It’s a matter of practicality…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  isn’t that practicality just ludicrous? I shouldn’t make new friends,  because people might ask Kaname about it… and I won’t even comment on  the attention whore thing.” Momomi closed her eyes and turned her face  away. “Sorry, but if you’re that jealous of Amane, you need a better  excuse than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Yeah, that’s one good way to gloss over the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  is what you called me any different?” Momomi irritably thrust a tawny  lock out of her eyes. “But if it is a matter of the people, that’s even  more ludicrous. Way beyond antisocial.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing like that.  It’s just inconvenient for me, while offering no benefits. You know I  hate this stuff, that’s just the way I am.” Kaname shook her head  irritably. “It’s bloody inconsiderate of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Has it occurred  to you that I can do harmless things without aiming to benefit you in  some way? I’m not your property or your body double.” Momomi pushed  herself forwards, sliding her feet over the bed and placing them on the  floor. “Get used to me doing something this harmless, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, isn’t it irritating, though?” Kaname replied. “There are so many people involved now. It was a lot easier before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Well, I like things the way they are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stared at each other for a few more moments. Kaname broke first. “Well,  forget it,” she muttered discontentedly. “If that’s the way it is.  Regardless, I haven’t enjoyed what I’ve experienced up till know and so  I’m not going to climb up onto a stage and make an exhibition of  myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed, relaxing slightly. “Well, I know this  isn’t really your kind of thing, but can’t you at least give it a try?  It would be a lot more fun if it was the two of us, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t even know how stuff like that is supposed to be fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now you’re just being over-dramatic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “Like hell I am?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  for the lack of a better metaphor… the feeling you get when you make me  laugh, it’d be the same thing as that.” Momomi prodded her shoulder  cautiously. “You should at least give it a try. If you don’t like it,  you don’t have to bother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her for a moment,  then turned away, staring at the wall. “It’s different, though. I  actually give a damn about you, but I don’t intend to humiliate myself  in front of three hundred people I could care less about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, for a start, if they really didn’t matter, you wouldn’t be so afraid of being humiliated,” Momomi said reasonably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  sure, I don’t want their contempt or their hate, but I get enough of  that already.” Kaname bit her lip, scowling deeply. “Or have you  already forgotten? They’ve hated me for a lot longer than they hated  you. I don’t give a damn, but that doesn’t mean I want to be reminded.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  one hates you that much,” Momomi said. “You made mistakes, but people  have short-term memories. A few good impressions would go a long way to  dispelling that reputation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right. If you believe that, you’re more naïve than even I thought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you think they care enough to hate you that much, you’re the naïve one.  People are very changeable, on the whole.” Momomi cocked her head,  smiling gently. “Besides, don’t you want people to acknowledge you?  Wouldn’t be good if they saw your true talents? Isn’t that what the  rivalry with Amane was about, in the first instance?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’d be a lot more convincing if it wasn’t just manipulation because you want me to do this damn play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be  more charitable, why don’t you? Besides, am I wrong? Would it so bad if  you tried something that people would admire for once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t  care what people think of me. They’re all blinkered, ditzy idiots  anyway.” Kaname glanced at her. “How about Amane? What talent are they  acknowledging there? Sure, she’s bloody perfect, but do they care? The  girl they recognise as her is so shallow and false it’s almost funny. I  don’t need such a meaningless boost to my ego.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you think  they chose to worship her at random, though, you’re being pretty  stupid,” Momomi replied. “Amane is Amane, and a lot of the attention  she receives is genuine. We both know you’re as good as her in many  ways, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again, that’s very interesting. But I still won’t participate in Shion’s damn play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Should you really say that before giving it a try? You might even enjoy it, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  grunted. “Well, should you really press on with manipulating me and  pushing your agenda when I’ve made it quite clear I’m not interested?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  pretty cruel, you know.” Momomi huffed irritably. “I told you, though  it didn’t get through your thick skull. This would be more fun if we  did it together. That’s reason enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean you want someone to back you up in your random ambitions to greatness. That’s what’s irritating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look,  it’s not just about that, you know,” Momomi sighed. “Sure, I have a  vested interest in this play. But I also want to have fun and take part  in something interesting. If it weren’t at least a little interesting,  I wouldn’t do it. The same with the script. The same with Olesa, Amane,  everything else I do. I’m not a perfect chessplayer, even if that’d  suit me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t find it even a little bit interesting. I’d appreciate it if you left me out of your calculations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as stubborn as ever, aren’t you? All you have to do is take part in the audition.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you’re still far too tenacious and annoying.” Kaname shook her head.  “No is no. That’s clear. In the meantime, we have biology to study and  you’re wasting precious time. On top of that, if you take part in the  play, we’ll have even less time for revision. That’s just  irresponsible.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still doing kendo, aren’t you?” Momomi  asked. “But my time at that point will be free once the script’s done,  after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, I’ll still have kendo. Quite apart from  that, I doubt the timing will be that convenient, and it’s going to  distract you. It’s annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if I pass the exam, I want my  school life to be memorable, too,” Momomi said. “And I’m sure you’re  the same. You can’t say this just because it’s convenient for your  argument.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That goes for a lot of things you’ve been saying recently.” Kaname opened her textbook again. “Now let’s get back to work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed, leaning sideways and resting her head on Kaname’s shoulder.  That was a strange feeling, after they’d just had a blazing row, but  the blue-haired girl let it be. “But it’s such a pity, Kaname, if Shion  intended what I think she did, you’d have had a very interesting role…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Here’s your notebook. I’ll read, we discuss aloud, you write it down. You know the program now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The script calls for twins,” Momomi explained, pointedly ignoring her. “And obviously, the best choice would be you and Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I get to act alongside that robot. Great.” Kaname flicked through the  contents pages, underlining certain headings with a pencil. “As if  she’s even going to turn up to the audition…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She sounds  half-interested. I’m sure I can swing it.” Momomi smiled. “But it isn’t  just interesting because you two would be acting together on stage.  It’s more of a competitive thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is the one contest she can win, whatever it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  role Viola is the main part and a very outstanding one, at that,”  Momomi added. “Some of her monologues are famous amongst actors to the  point of cliché. Sebastian, on the other hand, is a rather less  glorious role. I’m sure Shion wanted to see which actor would end up  where.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted derisively. “Are you kidding me? Amane gets the best role, because everyone loves her. Isn’t that obvious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  would be obvious in the whole school play, along with inter-school  politics,” Momomi said. “That’s why it’s a sham. But this one is being  run on merit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Merit, and Shion’s patronage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if  that’s true, you have Shion’s patronage.” Momomi sighed, leaning back.  “But it’s too bad. The audition would be a head to head between you  two… even if she was picked because of bias, you’d still have the  chance to outdo her on stage. And even if it’s not a formal contest,  she can’t blank you this time around. That much is obvious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not so desperate to beat her that I’ll fall in line with your plans,  you know,” Kaname chided. “You’re taking me for a simpleton.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shook her head, falling back and looking at the ceiling. “Not really. I  just thought it would be interesting to see, that’s all. And, when  you’re both skilled and alike, not having you involved would be boring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still not interested.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed again, looking at her hand. “Too bad… oh, well. Hopefully she’ll be easier to persuade.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled. “Her? Not bloody likely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’ll see how things go,” Momomi said neutrally.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname picked up the notebook and dropped it on her stomach. “Come on, let’s get to work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  ever, you’re mean and stubborn.” Momomi sat up, opening the book and  pulling a pencil from one of the pockets of her blaze. “Well, let’s  start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Okay, we’ll begin with flowering plants.  We need to cover over photosynthesis in more depth and we’ve done it  before, including the formula… 6CO2 plus 6H2O plus sunlight to C6H1206  plus 602. And then-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Slow down,” Momomi murmured. “What was that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  repeated the formula. “That’s important. We’ll get into that later.  After that, it’s all about factors that affect the rate of  photosynthesis.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So light intensity, water and so on?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  Then… let’s see…” She turned over a page. “Transpiration. That looks a  bit more complicated, it goes on for a couple of pages-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”  Momomi moved closer to Kaname, leaning lightly against her. “Well, no  point in getting too ahead of ourselves. Let’s start with that damn  equation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname flushed slightly. “Right. Well, let’s see… it’s  basically what we learned in class, but with the symbols now. Carbon  dioxide and water make glucose and oxygen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s pencil skittered across the page. “Okay. That’s easy enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  be honest, there’s not much else to say.” Kaname glanced at Momomi’s  face, admiring the way the hair fell over her eyes. “We just have to  learn it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded, raising a hand and pushing her hair out  of her eyes. “I can see that. So, what’s next? Factors affecting the  rate, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. <em>Does she know I’m watching, or is that unconscious? </em>“Well, let’s see… light intensity, amount of chlorophyll, amount of water, temperature, carbon dioxide levels…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got it. And one by one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shook her head, looking down and describing them all one by one. <em>This  casual closeness still isn’t something I’m used to. It feels good, but  also a little unhealthy, in way, when it follows straight after a  blazing row. What does that make me? Emotionally weak? I don’t know…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, you’re just reading from the textbook,” Momomi complained. “Come on, can’t you paraphrase it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, right.” Kaname nodded. “I’ll do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get too lazy. Otherwise I might as well photocopy that book, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Just as long as you understand…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  studied for most of lunch then set the books aside and opened their  bentos. Momomi sat back a little and faced Kaname, folding her legs.  She popped a pickle into her mouth and chewed quickly. “Shall we go on  another date next Saturday?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Now that’s got a lot easier to say…</em>Kaname nodded. “Sure. You have anything in mind?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  particularly.” Momomi sorted through her bento, moving all the fish to  one side. “We should probably plan things a little better this time,  though. Our track record on that isn’t great.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And, preferably, make it a little less expensive than the first one too,” Kaname suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Yeah, that’d be an idea. But we need to have fun, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “Let’s see… some kind of sport?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you, I’m not exactly big on sport.” Momomi shrugged. “Besides,  using the school facilities would be boring. How about an evening meal?  If we can run back before curfew fast enough…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s too  expensive.” Kaname picked up an umeboshi and fed her it. “What else?  Library? The school one, even I know that place as the school’s number  two make-out spot…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that a bad thing? It means other  people would take all the best spots. Besides, I see far too much of  that place in the week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname drummed her free fingers. “Yeah,  I can see that. Though we both like reading, after all, so we can do  that at some point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Just as soon as you’re less  shy around the other girls… which is ironic when you have no problem  with a less kind public.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have to face this lot every day. Trust me, it makes sense.” Kaname frowned. “What else do couples do on a date?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Movie?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve done that too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi ate some more rice. “You have a point…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we could always go to different kind of movie.” Kaname speared a piece  of fish. “But horror films won’t let you in, which is annoying. Perhaps  we can poach Shion’s laptop. The Scholarship Fund doesn’t include the  privilege of using a broadband connection…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Illegally  downloading a movie to watch on Shion’s laptop isn’t very romantic,”  Momomi chided. “There’s no ambience. Ambience is important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine, fine. Ambience.” Kaname closed her eyes. “Well, what else is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know… I suppose we could to the park again, but that’s a little  boring.” Momomi ate some more rice, then snapped her fingers. “Wait,  that’s it. Picnic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname raised her eyebrows. “Picnic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  nodded enthusiastically. “Right. Picnic. We can borrow a blanket from  somewhere and buy some cheap food from the local supermarket one of  these days, and make one up ourselves. That’s be economic and romantic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed, putting a hand over her eye. “Momomi, it’s the middle of winter. A little on the chilly side out…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  fine.” Momomi waved a hand dismissively. “I brought us scarves, we can  wrap up warm. Besides, it’ll mean there will be less people in the  park.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No need to go that far. The school is fine, isn’t it?”  Kaname leaned forwards slightly. “That way, if the weather gets too bad  we’ll be able to get back quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded her agreement. “In front of the lake?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Hopefully it won’t be taken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then it’s decided.” Momomi smiled triumphantly. “We can get food on Friday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shook her head slightly, closing her eyes. “My, my. I suspect I’ll be doing most of the work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“While we’re on the subject, what do you think of the other two?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amiki and Olesa? In that sense?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “I don’t have any right to be righteous, after the role they had with me, but still… it’s getting annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll say.” Kaname shook her head irritably. “Olesa is even more stubborn than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  that’s not a very nice thing to say,” Momomi teased, holding out a  piece of fish. “Especially when you can be a little obstinate, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  leaned forwards, eating it. “I guess… I guess so,” she agreed,  swallowing. “But still, Olesa just comes off as odd to me. She’s an  idealist, which is odd in itself. Amiki’s also annoying, with her damn  subservient attitude. They have a dysfunctional relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, who doesn’t? Certainly not us.” Momomi grinned. “Doesn’t that just make things more fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname groaned. “I guess we have to go through this crap before we can have the normal stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.  I think some people can have the normal stuff from the get go.” Momomi  shrugged. “But you can’t claim that any of us four are normal to begin  with. I guess this is just a reflection of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. It’s  still bloody annoying. This must be what Kariya feels, oh-so-often…”  Kaname shuddered. “You know things are bad when I’m empathising with  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe we should do something,” Momomi mused. “Olesa wasn’t short on plans herself, so it’d only be fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wouldn’t recommend it. Even if I bitch about it, it really isn’t our  business.” Kaname frowned, picking up some more fish. “Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so…” Momomi sighed. “But it sounds like so much fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It isn’t a matter of fun. This is a serious business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, are you happy with the way things are for them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not like I care.” Kaname pouted. “Like I said, it’s not my business.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smirked. “Oh, really? Well, I’m interested. They’ve been static for far  too long… far longer than us, even. Isn’t it dull?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re not exactly here for our entertainment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi folded her arms. “Well, I’ll give them a couple of weeks. After that, I may have to reassess the situation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  glanced at her, taking in her infectious grin and glittering eyes. “As  ever, you’re way too enthusiastic about these things… and where are you  slotting this into your schedule? You do too much as it is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By then, the thing with the Church should be over,” Momomi reminded her. “I can do it then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was speaking rhetorically…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On that subject, though, how’s kendo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty  good.” Kaname rubbed her head. “Kariya is frightening when she picks up  her bokken. It’s not killer intent, as such… it’s more the overwhelming  knowledge that she could have you scrubbing the Church belfry with a  toothbrush for the next five years if she liked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “As expected of Kariya-sama. For someone as fierce as her, it really isn’t a surprising hobby.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  she’s not a terrible teacher, I’ll concede that much.” Kaname glanced  at her girlfriend. “I’m getting better. It’s pretty fun, actually. And  she’s really keen on sparring, so I get to whack Amiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s good, actually. Someone like you should do something like that.” Momomi passed over another piece of fish. “It suits you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just as long as I don’t end up just like Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be cool.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be depressing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “She is the Etoile, you know? People would kill to be like her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I wouldn’t.” Kaname shrugged slowly. “To be honest, it doesn’t have  anything to do with her personal qualities. But when you’ve built up my  level of resentment concerning something, you really can’t become it.  That’s just too lame.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And are you normally worried about hypocrisy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not normally. But this is different, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so.” Momomi glanced at her, eyes amused. “But don’t worry,  Kaname. I can absolutely guarantee that you won’t end up being anything  like Kariya. I’m sure others would say the same as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Even if I agree with you, do you have to put it quite like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?” Momomi asked innocently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  whatever.” Kaname chased up more of her rice. “But yeah, kendo’s good.  If you have time, you should come and watch. I’ll show you want I can  do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I might just do that, when this time playscript is done,” Momomi agreed. “That does sound fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded her agreement. “Good. It’s settled, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi finished her bento, setting it aside and glancing at Kaname’s face. “Too bad. You’re a clean eater.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blinked at her mischievous eyes. “Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  leaned forwards. “Well, isn’t that a tradition? I say you’re a messy  eater, because you have a piece of rice just here-” She touched  Kaname’s cheek with a finger. “And then I eat it. And you, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname flushed, covering herself with a derisive snort. “How cliché is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very,” Momomi agreed. “I work better without prologue anyway.” She kissed Kaname on the cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shifted her bento out of the way, staring back with her stomach  bubbling. This, too was probably going to become part of the schedule.  “Ha. As ever, you’re way too forwards.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi touched her head  with both hands, kissing her on the lips. Kaname slipped forwards as  they twisted together, lips touching in swift and shallow motions.  Somehow, her hands slipped round and held Momomi in the small of the  back, feeling very natural. And her heart raced. She pulled away  slightly. “Do you even need a reason?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s hands slid down, settling on Kaname’s shoulders. She smiled, cheeks flushed beautifully. “You are my reason, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  rolled her eyes and kissed her to shut her up, heart fluttering as  those hands brushed her neck. Her own hands caught hold of Momomi’s  blazer, pulling the fabric slightly in a tacit reminder. <em>Hold back. Don’t get too intense.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  hands slid down again, rubbing across Kaname back. She murmured  slightly, pulling back slightly and touching her nose against the  taller girl’s cheek. “I really like you, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get any funny ideas,” Kaname warned, hugging her tightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi kissed her on the cheek, brushing her tongue against her skin. Then she pulled back slightly. “Did you like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you have to do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Too boring…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  kissed her, more fiercely than she’d intended. Moist lips pushed  against each other before she slipped back. “You should get ten times  better at the basics first,” she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled slightly. “You shouldn’t be afraid to admit you enjoy something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More  breathing, more kissing, more tentative, hungry touches, of the hands  and of the lips. Kaname let it happen, caught uneasily between the  comfort of her body and the apprehension of her mind. <em>It’s not that  I dislike this, far from that… no, the fact that I like it is what I  dislike. This represents something uncomfortable, a loss of control, in  a way. I don’t like to be involved, I like to be distant and cool and  collected, and this is the opposite of that. When we’re like this,  however smart I talk, I’m in so deep I don’t know which way is up. Does  she know that? She already knows so much about me, but I try to hide  it, as hard as I can. She makes it feel so easy, so simple, so safe,  but I can’t quite trust that. I can’t quite trust her. This is the  start of something, and even if I enjoy it now I don’t know how far  down that path I can walk before I feel doubts…or, even worse, how far  I could go while enjoying every step… it’s too spontaneous, too  uncertain, too wavering…as…</em>It wasn’t easy to concentrate, when their breaths mingled and Momomi’s smell overwhelmed her world. <em>I  think that it’s too dangerous, that I should pull away, that we don’t  have to go so far so young, not here and now, there’s no need for  it…but even if I acknowledge all that in my head, I’m still trapped  here. I can’t know what’s going to do next, when I’m like this I don’t  know my limits. That’s probably supposed to be wonderful, but it scares  me. Perhaps I am too young, but who can say that out loud? I just have  to decide, and fall into that decision. But which way? Forwards or  back. I don’t know. For her, it’s a lot simpler. Or is she just more  mature?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bell rang, startling them out of their embrace.  Momomi smiled and stepped back, picking up her bag and shouldering.  “Well, we’d better get going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No epilogue, either?” Kaname  asked, standing and brushing herself off. She felt afterimages of  Momomi’s arms round her, Momomi’s warm body pressed against her,  trapped by the silk shirts… the memories comforted and disturbed her in  equal measure. “You’re the type to take what they want and leave,  aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I won’t apologise,” Momomi teased. “You’re not someone who will let me get away with that, now are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. At least you know something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I’ll see you later. Bye.” Momomi waved, heading off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname groaned, picking up her own bag along with the biology textbook they’d knocked down. <em>How  can she be so casual about this? But more importantly than that, why  does she aver that so confidently? Like this, I might well let her get  away with that. Yes, I think that’s it. That’s what scares me, most of  all. Not that I can tell her that, of course.</em></span></p>
