<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 19 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ninemil.html">ninemil</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Tamao watched as the gothic metal hand completed its second pass, the clock mechanism 
halting briefly as the archaic movement&#39;s momentum slipped between cog groupings and the 
minute hand shuffled that tiny step closer toward Tamao&#39;s point of expectation.

6:57 the flip display beneath the analogue face then clicked over to, the individual plates 
clicking and clacking as they fell back into place.

The fourth year watched briefly as the dusty black and white display made its proclamation, 
sighing softly before dropping her deep violet eyes back to the white linen duvet cover she 
rested upon. The sound of the shower persisted throughout the dormitory in the mean time, 
saturating the space beneath the older Etoile&#39;s train of thought.

It had been a heavy night, of that there was no doubt at all. The fourth year remained in 
her ball gown despite the long hours past, and her otherwise perfectly combed hair showed 
the first signs of needing to be tied back for presentation&#39;s sake.

Her appearance was the last thing playing on the young Etoile&#39;s mind however.

Tamao had remained with Miyuki in that classroom until gone three or four in the morning, 
the Etoile A&Atilde;&reg;n&Atilde;&copy;e initially resistant to partaking in Miyuki&#39;s reminiscence, but all too 
quickly finding herself drawn by the parallels in Miyuki&#39;s tale to her own position as most 
notable other party. As such, Tamao had forced herself to relax a little, listening intently 
as the sixth year worked against her demons, the shattered Rokujo girl slowly emerging from 
the evening&#39;s devastation.

Taking in what had been said, the Hanazono history now laid utterly bare before her, Tamao 
was sure more than ever before of what would be required of her following Nagisa&#39;s warm 
reacceptance the previous afternoon; of what she&#39;d have to do both to secure the future of 
that friendship and to maintain her own mental stability.

There was no way now that she would allow herself to become the next Miyuki Rokujo, no 
circumstance under which she would permit herself to fall foul of that precarious slope down 
toward bitterness and resentment.

Nagisa and Shizuma would remain an absolute in her mind, something she could never allow 
herself to doubt the future of. She would stay the close friend and confidant she&#39;d always 
wished she could be to someone, and the rest, the telling expectations that her interactions 
with the red head had given birth to... well that belonged to another realm, something she 
would have to work out alone once more, something she would have to hope presented itself in 
another companionship elsewhere.

Her place at Nagisa&#39;s side would be one of support and understanding, and that would be all 
the gratification she could expect to draw from it.

Nothing &#39;less than&#39; about that she&#39;d once heard someone else say, and with as much 
conviction as she could muster, that now became her modus operandi.

As such, when it came to leaving the classroom, intent and necessity conveniently 
dovetailed, the council President less than enthusiastic about returning to her own 
dormitory for fear of waking Shizuma if she happened to be next door, and Tamao wanting to 
return to her own room to retrieve something of significance she felt she needed before the 
morning&#39;s coming interactions.

Agreeing on early morning refreshments, the two seniors had retired to Tamao&#39;s dormitory for 
fresh tea, after which Miyuki had eventually disappeared off into the shower to clean up 
while Tamao continued in her place of deep consideration, the fourth year waiting patiently 
for the clock to strike seven so she could begin the morning&#39;s work.

And as the antique Swiss time piece clicked one step closer to seven o&#39;clock, Tamao 
readjusted the prize she&#39;d sought from returning to her room, the single silver band that 
adorned her right wrist now warming to her body temperature, the dainty heart-shaped locket 
that hung from it spiralling in the early morning light.

&quot;To the best friend anyone could wish for &acirc;&#128;&#147; Aoi-san &amp; Hanazono-san,&quot; she whispered as she 
held the pendant still while she reread the inscription, the young Etoile once again 
determined to continue as just that.

- - - - -

Nagisa giggled as she bolted from the former-Etoile&#39;s reach, stumbling precariously across 
the length of the dormitory mattress before almost tumbling off the other end. Wild eyed and 
playful in expression, the youngster whirled back toward the older upperclassman with her 
hands grasping awkwardly behind her back.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to put it on Shizuma, not take it off!&quot; she asserted, the red head fumbling with 
the clips on her delicately laced underwear.

She was naked beside that and her knickers, and the watching sixth year retained a somewhat 
predatory undertone as she stalked the space at the other end of the room.

Shizuma&#39;s smile twisted briefly with the further hint of mischievousness, after which she 
offhandedly surrendered the chase, the older girl waving her acceptance with an air 
flippancy given both girls knew full well that she&#39;d have the entire evening to reengage 
that particular battle.

Pushing wayward silver strands back from her face, the former-Etoile straightened up, 
smoothing her uniform down as she regarded the younger girl through her lazy emerald gaze.

&quot;Well if you hadn&#39;t slept in so late you wouldn&#39;t have had this problem would you,&quot; she 
flashed back with an air of moral superiority. Shizuma then tipped her crown to one side as 
she adjusted her hairclip.

&quot;And you snored like a pig, so not only did you make yourself late by lying in, you also 
prolonged my misery as well&quot; she teased, Nagisa poo-pooing the idea as she poked her tongue 
back through a cheeky grin.

Glancing into the wall mirror and happy with her own appearance, Shizuma then returned her 
attention to Nagisa&#39;s.

&quot;It&#39;s ten past my love, let&#39;s not be late and start the day on a bad foot,&quot; she said.

Nagisa nodded her agreement, the happy air slipping slightly as she returned her attentions 
to the task at hand with a more serious resolve than before.

Today didn&#39;t promise to be easy, something both girls had long since accepted, but once out 
of the way, the previous evening&#39;s social consequences could be filed for the length of the 
Yuletide break, while the necessary exchanges with both Miyuki and Tamao became something 
that could be handled as and when the most appropriate opportunities presented themselves, 
eased by the vacuum of an almost empty Dormitory Hall.

Shizuma to a degree seemed eager to face these challenges, Nagisa understandably a little 
less so, but still fully appreciative of the need, even if she disliked the underlying 
concept. Miyuki would have to be a very different woman come spring before the redhead would 
back down again, such was the level of resentment she retained.

No more door mat, no more walkover. Whilst Miyuki might not be fully responsible for her 
feelings, Nagisa had no intentions of holding her tongue when the school council President 
opted to vent them in further inappropriate manners. It was time everyone involved in their 
obscure little assembly grew up before the implications ruined life for everyone, including 
the other girls around them.

Nagisa found her mind drifting to little Chiyo as she buttoned up her petticoat, reaching 
for her black Miatorian dress as she pictured the tiny first year standing in the PA well.

She would visit her petite s&Aring;&#147;ur before Chiyo&#39;s parents arrived to collect her; concern would 
only nag the fourth year until spring term otherwise.

Clipping the black uniform into place, she looked up at the silver haired woman before her 
with a sideways glance, a flush of warmth reaching her somewhere private, echoed by the rush 
of physical memory.

That woman is insatiable, she thought to herself, a quiet smile reaching her lips, the 
sentiment reflected in her swimming auburn eyes.

Shizuma caught the tone.

&quot;And what are you thinking about now young missy?&quot; she inquired, the subtext in her voice 
all too clear.

&quot;I&#39;m thinking we&#39;re going to make use of that spar at your Summer House this holiday,&quot; the 
red head mumbled quietly, her eyes somewhere else as she reached for her hair brush and 
bands.

Pushing aside the immediately appealing proposition, the older girl interjected quickly, 
Shizuma&#39;s tone carrying a demanding edge to it.

&quot;Leave it down,&quot; she asserted, her emerald eyes sparkling softly as she regarded her lover, 
&quot;you know I prefer it that way.&quot;

The red head shuffled the wooden handle between her fingers for a moment, the brush rocking 
on its edge against the writing desk&#39;s hard oak surface as a brief but distance thought 
crossed the back of Nagisa&#39;s mind, the fourth year quietly picturing that dark haired 
spectre on the balcony during the previous evening. Pushing the memory aside however, the 
young woman nodded in agreement,

&quot;Yes Shizuma-sama,&quot; she said, and she turned back to her fianc&Atilde;&copy;e, smiling as she met her 
lover&#39;s warm green gaze.

&quot;Would you brush it for me please?&quot; she asked.

- - - - -

Hitomi was the first to approach the Hanazono couple as they descended the foyer stairs into 
the churning chaos below. Collection day was already in full swing, with several of the less 
patient parental units already present in the hallway, and waiting for their daughters to 
appear. Hurrying the length of the residential building, various school council members 
would then be running between dormitories, quickly ensuring that each individual was ready 
for departure before returning to the entrance to complete the discharge documentation and 
see the girl off.

It was a long, arduous task that would no doubt take the full length of the morning. 
However, this was protocol, and the formality was a requirement of the Sister&#39;s oath of 
custody and protection, the Christian sentiment of which remained very much as stern and 
resolute as it had a century previously when Miator had first opened, such was the 
dedication of the staff to maintain tradition.

Although Nagisa had witnessed this once already, the sheer scale of the operation still 
overwhelmed her, the noise of the cars outside and the sheer weight of numbers present both 
there and within the Dormitory foyer something quite unnerving.

Quietly descending the stairs, she did her best to retain her regal air as representative of 
all three schools, Shizuma remaining close beside her, although at a proper and appropriate 
distance whilst within such a public forum.

This decreased considerably however when the beleaguered looking Tougi girl climbed the 
stairs toward the couple, her plum bob betraying her troubled slate eyes hidden beneath.

&quot;Etoile-sama, Shizuma-sama, I need to talk to you both,&quot; she said, nodding hastily before 
adding with emphasis, &quot;in private if I may.&quot;

&quot;Is something wrong Hitomi?&quot; Shizuma asked, her voice edged with concern.

&quot;It&#39;s about last night,&quot; came the council assistant&#39;s reply, her manner overcome with her 
intent.

However Nagisa&#39;s point of focus fell directly behind the sixth year, fixed at the bottom of 
the stairs instead.

Behind Shizuma&#39;s kinder garden friend stood another figure, the young woman wrapped in an 
ice blue dress, her long dark hair falling across her shoulders.

&quot;Tamao-chan?&quot; the red head whispered under her breath, her heart in her throat as she 
considered the other girl&#39;s expression and attire.

Catching the red head&#39;s worried gaze but not her hushed exclamation, Hitomi turned quickly, 
unsure of who to expect.

&quot;Etoile-sama,&quot; she then repeated immediately, bowing briefly before the older 
representative.

Tamao remained silent a moment longer, her body language worn and her appearance fast 
betraying it. She&#39;d obviously not slept, nor had she taken the time to change from her ball 
dress. Nagisa quickly noted with growing concern, the presence of tear stains across the 
front of Tamao&#39;s dress, not that her fellow Etoile&#39;s eyes showed the hint of them having 
been hers.

&quot;Nagisa-chan,&quot; the dark haired girl finally muttered with a low but fond smile. Repeating 
the greeting, she nodded to the others,

&quot;Shizuma-sama, Tougi-san,&quot; she continued.

Shizuma and Hitomi gestured their replies as the Etoile Cadette drifted from beside them and 
down the steps toward her fourth year classmate.

&quot;Has Tamao-chan not slept?&quot; Nagisa asked in dismay, her expression dropping as she took her 
friend&#39;s hands in her own.

Tamao smiled wearily, her heart warmed by the concern.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Nagisa-chan, I&#39;m fine,&quot; she said, reassuring the other fourth year by squeezing 
the red head&#39;s fingers.

&quot;It&#39;s been a long night, that&#39;s all,&quot; she finished.

Shizuma&#39;s face retained an air of thoughtful distraction and she tipped her gaze to the 
front of Tamao&#39;s dress.

&quot;You don&#39;t... happen to know where Miyuki is, do you?&quot; she asked apprehensively.

The fourth year looked up from Nagisa&#39;s embrace, her face shifting slightly.

&quot;With all respect Shizuma-sama, I&#39;m not sure you should be asking that question just yet,&quot; 
she replied, her voice appropriately lowered and polite, although carried by a firm 
undertone. She nodded briefly before continuing,

&quot;I believe you&#39;ll find she&#39;ll approach you when she&#39;s ready.&quot;

Shizuma raised an eyebrow,

&quot;You&#39;ve already spoken to her?&quot; the former-Etoile asked.

Tamao nodded gently.

&quot;Is she okay? What did she say to you Suzumi-san?&quot; Shizuma pressed.

But Tamao&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly, her air slipping a good step toward authoritarian,

&quot;Enough to know you shouldn&#39;t be asking where she is yet Shizuma-sama. Not yet, it wouldn&#39;t 
be fair,&quot; she replied.

The former-Etoile chewed her bottom lip, her expression openly troubled, Shizuma worried by 
the implication of Tamao&#39;s words for Miyuki&#39;s state of mind and the distinct possibility of 
an all too aggressive subtext buried within the fourth year&#39;s tone. The last thing Shizuma 
had wanted from last night&#39;s rebuttal was to have made a new enemy as well as hurt her dear 
old friend. But then as her eyes wandered vacantly from Tamao&#39;s face, she caught the glint 
of something metallic, something Nagisa&#39;s left hand was already toying with.

The red head glanced back in the pause as though she&#39;d read her lover&#39;s mind, the object&#39;s 
presence marked in its declaration and importance.

Catching her girlfriend&#39;s expression, Shizuma&#39;s emerald eyes then returned to Tamao&#39;s wrist, 
and then slowly back to meet the older fourth year&#39;s gaze.

&quot;Tamao-chan,&quot; she breathed, and the darker Etoile smiled wearily.

&quot;Shizuma-sama,&quot; she replied, half shrugging her exhaustion. Descending the stairs carefully, 
the Hanazono woman drew her arms around the fourth year girls still half embraced before 
her, a gentle hand brushing across Tamao&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered, and Tamao&#39;s face washed briefly with a tired but happy sadness, 
her eyes loaded and full.

All three knew the significance that the long absent bracelet carried, as well as that of 
Tamao&#39;s decision to finally wear it.

Unable to hold either girls&#39; gaze for fear of bubbling over, the older Etoile let her deep 
blue eyes fall to the floor, the girls heads drawing in close, the trio collapsing briefly 
in a poignant three-way hug.

&quot;How touching,&quot; came a stern voice from behind the group, the words preceded by the sound of 
someone clearing their throat.

Turning toward the ground floor carpet, the trio split by enough distance so that they could 
all see the speaker, the group considering the oh so pretentious subtext underwriting 
Reiko&#39;s body language, the fifth year stood with her hand on her hip and her wicked sapphire 
eyes twinkling in the low light of her silhouette.

&quot;Unfortunately we have more pressing matters for the Etoile to contend with,&quot; she continued, 
the young woman considering the finer details of her fingernail as she pressed her right 
index finger together against her thumb.

&quot;The police are here,&quot; she said, casually glancing up to satisfy herself with the shocked 
reaction.

&quot;Although not currently residential, it would seem one of the Spican students has gone 
missing from her home in Momoyama,&quot; she explained, before adding with deliciously delivered 
dramatics,

&quot;The Nanto family would also like to know where their daughter is, given they&#39;ve arrived to 
collect her and no one has seen the child since yesterday&#39;s afternoon meal.&quot;

Cocky as she delivered such a damning string of news, the would be council President then 
stated the obvious just in case everyone else in the foyer had missed it,

&quot;Ladies, it would appear our sister institute has developed a pair of runaways.&quot;
