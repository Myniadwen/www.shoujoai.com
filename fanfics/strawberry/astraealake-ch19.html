<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I've been  experimenting, especially with Kaname's letters, with  stream-of-conciousness writing, throwing up whatever comes into my head  and putting awkward pauses where I have them myself. I edited a little  more than I'd have liked this chapter, though that's inevitable because  it's an important chapter. Now, where was I... I'm rambling myself...  forget it. Oh, and I don't have anything against Miator or Lulim. But  Momomi does.</span></p>

Shion  snored as Momomi woke from her fitful sleep, far earlier than was  strictly necessary. She snored as Momomi showered, cleaned her teeth,  brushed her hair and dressed carefully. She snored as Momomi packed her  schoolbag methodically, double-checking her timetable and carefully  adding her umbrella. She snored as the girl walked over to her,  hesitated for a moment, then left without a word. Or her bag, come to  that, and rather sooner than breakfast. Shion smiled without shifting  her position.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good luck, Momomi-chan. I believe in you.”</span></p>

Serané,  also up and about earlier than most students were, knocked on a certain  door. “Kenjou-san, it’s Serané. Could you open the door, please? I’m  here to apologise for what Kariya said yesterday, from what I’ve heard  she got a little carried away…” She knocked again. “I know it’s early,  but I think courtesy is important, and I’d like to clear this issue up.  I’m afraid she may have gone too far.” When there was no reply, she  opened the door, and was moderately surprised to see no Kaname. “Gone,”  she said to herself. But then something caught her eye, a screwed up  letter that had missed the bin by inches. She walked forwards and  leaned down to pick the piece of paper up and place it where it was  supposed to go, but something checked her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané was an Etoile, and  more than an Etoile, an old-school aristocrat, a firm believer in  manners, propriety and common courtesy as cardinal virtues which  informed her every word and action. If there was no politeness in  society, there could be no decency. Simple consideration of the  feelings of others was the basis of everything, and to be a good  person, you had to begin with that. However, she had also learned a few  things from Kariya, and the first of them was the fact that sometimes,  to achieve something especially good, it was necessary to be a little  bad. And what people didn’t know didn’t hurt them. If no one was being  hurt, it was fine, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So she closed the door quietly, sat  at Kaname’s desk, and carefully opened up the letter, reading it slowly  and thoroughly. Then she set it aside and picked the next one out of  the bin, and read that as well, her face unreadable. A few minutes  later, seven letters were placed in two neat rows and she was flipping  open her phone. “Heya, Kari-chan. Are you busy? No, nothing like that…  but come to Kenjou-kun’s room. Don’t be so serious…I’ve found some good  unintentional comedy, that’s all. Something to share… oh, but of  course, this is very important research. If we can understand  Kenjou-kun’s thoughts, we’re in a better position to help her, aren’t  we? My, you’re being very uncharitable, Kari-chan… see you in a minute,  then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané returned her phone to her pocket and leaned back,  smiling. The world was a wonderful place, she reflected. There were  interesting things to be found everywhere.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Momomi  walked across the grass, her hands stuck in her pockets, savouring the  cold morning air and the quiet around her. Those were all welcome  sensations after an uncomfortable night. She’d dreamed of something,  something vaguely disturbing and unpleasant, saddening and lonely, all  those things, but she was damned if she could remember any of it. There  was nothing left when she’d woken up, except a cold sweat and a forlorn  feeling. Which was ridiculous. Dreams were weird at the best of times,  downright annoying at the worst. Being able to put you in a certain  mood without going to the bother of giving you memories, that was the  worst of the worst. If a scary dream was memorable, it could be  dismissed with laughable ease, because every scary dream she’d ever had  became ridiculous under the light of day. But when there was no memory,  no logic, no justification, nothing to overanalyse and consider until  it had been ripped to shreds, only an inalienable feeling… it made you  feel powerless, and those disquieted emotions became difficult to  shift. The light of day helped. When the air was so cold and fresh, the  world so beautiful, it was hard to take even dream-feelings seriously.  So she walked with her eyes half-closed, letting her feet pick out  their own path as she approached the forest. There was still plenty of  time before the day began proper, and it was time she could enjoy alone.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>There’s actually a lot to be said for being an early riser </em>Momomi mused. <em>It’s  a fairly novel experience, but there’s no godamn whiny students around  and there’s nothing that has to be done. It just leaves time to think,  and enjoy the surroundings, without worrying whether you’ll walk round  a corner and find a couple making out or bump into walking students  who’ll noisily chat in your direction out of some perceived obligation.  This is how a place like this is intended to be used, when it’s empty  and there’s no one but you, walking around with a sense of propriety. I  guess this is what a manor’s garden should be like, really. My mother  would love a place like this. It’s a lot more natural than the stately  garden we have back home. No, that’s right, she came here, didn’t she?  It’s her type of place, a complete dreamworld… that’s what Kaname said,  of course, but that doesn’t mean she’s wrong. I wonder whether mother  ever… how to put it…never mind. That’s not a happy kind of speculation.  The school was probably a lot different in those days, because when she  was younger it would be impossible to live as we do now. People can  talk nostalgically about the past all they like, and say that morals  are on the decline, but for a place like Astraea to be possible,  somewhere so ridiculously fairy-tale and innocent, but with such  depths, I could only call that an improvement.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Somehow I  can see her here, walking like this. She’d wear Miator’s uniform, of  course, because to someone like her and her parents alike tradition is  far more wonderful and important than teaching, aptitude and academia.  God, I can so totally imagine her, too, as an obnoxiously enthusiastic  room temp, dressing up in an apron and going to help out her beloved  senpais… makes me sick to the stomach. Perhaps it’s just because I’m an  impetuous child, as my father would put it, but I don’t defer to anyone  because they happen to be older than I am. That’s just too stupid. All  the same, she’d do that, because she’d think it was cute, and I’m sure  she’d worship her senpais quite freely, to their acute embarrassment.  And when she grew older, the situation would reverse, and she’d be very  kind and interested in her own room helper, and… I don’t know…make  pretty things and give flowers and talk to them about stuff, whatever  the hell the over-eager senpais do in Miator. She’d have friends, too,  a lot of empty-headed vaguely pleasant girls with a lot of casual,  unchallenged prejudices. And they’d go for picnics and things like  that, and she’d enjoy the outside and the forest and all that stuff,  and she’d talk a lot about flowers and point them all out to her  friends. She’d be good at art and poetry, and she’d probably join the  literature club, and she’d struggle with academic subjects while  moaning cutely. I hate to admit it, but I definitely got my  intelligence from my father. And so she’s while away the years in idle  pleasure, and by the time she’s finished and through she’s had a lot of  fun and learned not very much. That happens far too much, even now.  Students sent here to go through the motions of learning and waste  time. I may hate my father, but my god, did he make sure we were  educated. I probably learned more before I was twelve than my mother  ever did.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s why I made Spica my first choice, I  suppose. However you look at it, we’re the most serious of the three.  Lulim is just for people here to play around and carry on being  children. Miator pretends to be strict and straight-laced, but in  reality it’s also about playing around, this time harking after a lost  age, from their uniforms to the room temps to their obsession with the  past. It’s like dress-up, let’s play aristocrats, pretending that times  haven’t changed and that you can get by on being genteel and social. In  that respect, it’s a very good preparation for life, because that kind  of aristocrat is a dying breed. My father managed to read the writing  on the wall. Olesa’s seen it and has set her life to following that  changing course, but of course she’s in Spica. In Miator, though, they  pretend nothing’s changed, even though some of the players are the new  rich who want to pretend they’re the old rich. But with Spica, it’s  about results, not how you get them, not how polite you are or whether  you hold a fork right. That’s why Kaname’s here, of course, because  she’s the ultimate proof of a talent that supersedes personality.  That’s why I chose this school, not Miator, even though the Etoiles are  from Miator and they subtly showed it when they gave me their tour and  their advice. The competition for Etoile is cutthroat, because of that.  It’s ridiculous that the Etoile pair has to be from one school, too,  but that’s because of that as well, a power struggle. I wonder how many  years it will be before people like Kariya and Serané happen to be in  different schools, and tear those stupid rules down. I might even get  to see that, but it doesn’t seem too likely.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mother recommended Miator, as well, which is hardly surprising. Another reason for me to go to Spica. </em>Momomi frowned. <em>But  when I think about it, she never did talk much about her schooldays  here, even when she recommended it to me, even when it was clear I was  going. I accepted because it was better than bowing to my father,  rather than because she’d made a great case. Why, I wonder? Because she  actually had a hard time here? Or because she found it so wonderful  here that she can’t bear to talk about now? It’s not like she enjoys  the life she has now…and it’s not like I really know her. Is there  anything to know? </em>She snorted. <em>Well, it’s anyone’s guess, because I never bothered to find out.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was a flicker of movement in reaction to the sound, but before that had  really registered she’d stepped forwards, clearing the trees and  reaching a smooth, grassy bank. Shock quivered through her frame,  quickly followed by a bolt of fear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stared up at her, crimson eyes wide.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi,” Momomi managed. <em>Shit! Why is she here? Why did I even come here? I’m haven’t planned things out yet…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yo,” Kaname said with a forced casualness. She turned her head and looked at the lake again, folding her arms over her legs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  mind had gone blank, which was almost a mercy because she knew the  alternative was incoherent panic. “I’m surprised to see you here,” she  ventured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Kaname said, her lips barely forming the syllables.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t  you normally up at the paddock?” Momomi kicked herself mentally. It had  just slipped out, somehow, a half-formed thought that should never have  left her head.</span></p>
“You’re right,” Kaname said rigidly. “I should be going.” She began to stand up-
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Running away?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like hell,” Kaname snapped, facing her with blistering eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it seemed like that,” Momomi said, trying to sound calm. <em>Oh, great. What a start. Insult her then hold her back by baiting her. Can’t I do anything else?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought I’d do you a favour, that’s all. It’s very tactful of me, under the circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My feelings? I’m not the one running away,” Momomi replied. She set her chin. “I didn’t run away yesterday, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I knew when to walk away. But you’re the one who-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I what?” Momomi demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” Kaname said, folding her arms. “If you don’t know what I mean, then forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat down with her back to a tree, huffing. “If you’re going to say something, say it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  glanced at her irritably, then turned and sprawled on the ground, arms  still folded. “Be careful about provoking me, I might say what I had  intended to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried to work out what to make of this. <em>If  she’s holding something back right now, that’s probably good. I doubt  she has anything to say about me that I’d want to hear. </em> “I was  surprised, though,” she sniffed, trying to cover for her earlier  blunder. “It’s bloody early. Normally you’d still in bed right now,  or-” she shut her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or mooning over Amane, as you would put  it,” Kaname finished. “But you’re up just as early, and that’s even  more unusual. You hog the bed like a pig.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s pretty  hypocritical from the girl I have to wake up two days in three,” Momomi  said, folding her own arms and glaring back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the third day, I beat you by an hour or more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Well, you interrupted my chain of thought,” Momomi said. “It’s very annoying, I’ve completely lost my thread now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where you been? Sleeping with Olesa?” There was a sour note in Kaname’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion,  actually, she doesn’t have a roommate.” Momomi snorted. “Thanks to you,  I had to suffer through a night with the manic stalker senpai. I hope  you’re happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks to me? I didn’t force you to <em>run away </em>from coming back to my room last night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  what would you have done if I had turned up? Shouted at me some more?  Hit me? With your violent temper, only an idiot would have come back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I would have slammed the door in your face anyway,” Kaname said. “It’s the best for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’d slam the door in my face? I’m sorry, but you’re still the one running away here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what I hate about you,” Kaname said. “You’re always so bloody  headstrong. It’s always my fault, my flaw, my mistake. Don’t be so  bloody quick to lay the blame.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just telling you things how I see them,” Momomi replied. “It’s not my fault if the truth’s unwelcome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The truth of an egoist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, you’re the one calling me arrogant? That’s not hypocritical at all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is what I mean. Any fault I see in you is automatically a fault in me.”  Kaname gritted her teeth and wrenched her head round to look at the  lake again. “That’s just bloody stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, feel free to disagree with me. I tend to disagree with your assessments, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The truth really is unwelcome,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not about the truth as such,” Momomi said. “But you’re the last person  who should be talking about me being headstrong and egotistical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I’m not perfect! I get that, already, I’m not delusional like you! Dos that mean I’m not allowed to say anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s  palm slammed into the ground, her fingers twisting and ripping through  a dozen strands of grass. “I’m getting sick of it! Even when I did  everything you wanted me to do, even when I apologised for every little  thing, I still wasn’t good enough! So just forget it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you dare murmur <em>Kaname</em>,”  the blue-haired girl said bitterly. “Messing with my head, every time  you say anything, I’m fed up with that as well. I hate it when it’s the  real you talking, but it’s better than the alternative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  look,” Momomi snapped. She realised she was striking the wrong tone,  took a breath, and tried again. “I know you’re not perfect, but that  doesn’t mean you’re not good enough, as you put it. I’m not an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It gets hard to tell, especially when you’re picking at every little bit of my personality!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean you don’t?” Momomi snorted. “If you can’t take it, you shouldn’t say those things in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not the one who projects all the faults onto someone else,” Kaname  snapped. “That’s like the opposite of being able to take criticism.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you’re the one throwing up your hands petulantly and putting words in  my mouth. You just insult people to prop up your oh-so-fragile ego,  which is seriously immature.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the one with insecurities,  that’s why you hide yourself behind that damn mask of yours,” Kaname  returned. “But it’s only a mask. You were crying yesterday, and I know  it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blushed and scowled. “So what if I was? I hope you feel very proud of yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  give me that crap, I had plenty of it from Kariya,” Kaname said.  “You’re no kind of victim. You tell me, though. Were you crying because  my words were too close to the truth? Or were you just faking it to  gain sympathy from everyone else? That’d be consistent with your  character, to manipulate the situation like that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up! It was nothing like that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it makes sense, doesn’t it?” Kaname demanded. “That’s how you use  people! Like all those sweet words about how much you love Astraea,  it’s all nonsense…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yesterday was different,” Momomi said, breath ragged. “I wasn’t faking anything!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “You don’t have to deny it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You think so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course! But it’s like you! You’re so weak you can’t deal with people,  so you use them instead, or else you make weakness a way to use them.  That’s what you’re like-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi threw herself up and at the  taller girl, eyes wild. “Don’t you dare say that! You cold bitch! I was  hurt, I was hurt so badly, I was really crying, and you’re just so  irresponsible that you ignore that! What the hell do you know about me?  What the hell do you know about anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d grabbed Kaname  with the vague intention of throttling her to death, but the girl was  far too slippery, knocking her off with a single blow. She fell  forwards, managing to catch Kaname’s shoulders, and shook her in  frustration before she could turn around. “You’re just a dumb, stupid,  idiotic, muscle-headed insensitive little-” she broke off, wiping her  eyes, but a teardrop had already hit Kaname’s shoulder. “I hate you,”  she said, sniffing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname touched the drop in something approaching disbelief. “You’re really crying,” she said, stupefied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  really crying,” Momomi said. “I hate that, your surprise… have you any  idea what it feels like? When you make it so I can’t do anything or say  anything or feel anything sincere at all, that there’s nothing I can do  that you’ll trust or believe on, when everything I do is pointless  because you’ll never recognise it for what it is! I hate it! Can’t I  feel this? Can’t I feel pain? Or am I manipulating you again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  turned and threw her arms round Momomi’s neck. “Don’t cry,” she  instructed, eyes still wide open. “You’re not allowed to cry.” But her  voice was a little softer than it had been before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hate you,”  Momomi repeated. “Because you make me like this…” She tried to find  words. “So don’t think I’m invincible. You got hurt because I say  things… so don’t be stupid enough to think I’m any different…. I’m not  omniscient, Kaname, I’m just a stupid girl…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname tilted her, laying her down on the bank next to her. “I’m sorry,” she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Momomi opened her eyes, looking at her friend in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said I’m sorry!” Kaname snapped. “I guess it was stupid of me to think  that a girl like you could be as good as she says she is at using  people…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I was stupid to believe in you,” Momomi said,  leaning her head on Kaname’s shoulder. “You said no words could ever  hurt you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t supposed to be like this,” Momomi whispered after a while.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Kaname asked, puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wasn’t supposed to shout or cry… I was going to think it through, I’d  have it all planned out. And then I’d just tell you. It wasn’t supposed  to be so… hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname managed a weak chuckle. “That’s manipulative, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané  told me something,” Momomi said. “She said that people manipulate  others all the time… whenever we say or do anything to make them feel  different, that’s manipulation of a kind. But that doesn’t make it bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps.  But it’s very you to think you can plan everything out as if it’ll go  perfectly in real life.” Kaname sighed. “Things aren’t that convenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wasn’t even supposed to meet you this morning,” Momomi said. “So I’ve  noticed.” She wiped her eyes again. “But I won’t cry any longer. I  never intended to cry. I won’t be that weak.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They say tears are a woman’s weapons,” Kaname said quietly. “Fitting for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you just screw around hitting people and pretending you’re a man,”  Momomi replied. She should probably move away from Kaname about now,  but she was damned if she could find the energy. <em>Well, she can support me. She deserves to have to do that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It works, though. I feel kinda bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you finally realised what you made me feel like? If it took you this long, that’s even worse…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I felt like shit as well, standing there in the rain on the off-chance  that you might remember,” Kaname said. “And everything else. Not  knowing what I am to you. Not knowing whether I’m anything but a tool.  Just waiting and waiting and waiting and afraid because if I ask you’ll  have to answer and I don’t know what the answer’s going to be… that’s  not funny at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really worried about that?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that just makes you the same as me,” Kaname said evasively. “We overestimated each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, you’re just being stupid,” Momomi said. “Whenever you said it… it was true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“True?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname  is the person I can’t manipulate, not that easily… maybe the little  things, perhaps to get a rise out of her, because she’s a little  insecure and with a lot of bluster… but I could never use her for the  big things. Not because she’s smart, though she is smart… Kaname’s my  friend. That’s why…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Friend? As if someone like you could have a friend,” Kaname said. But it was more a feeble defence than a crushing jab.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  smiled weakly. “I wanted to be that strong… you wanted to be that  strong… but I’m not someone who can do that. I don’t know Kaname’s  feelings, but you’re my friend. I saw you as that for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  couldn’t you have said that or something?” Kaname said, not meeting her  eyes. “You’ve no idea how much I fretted and worried, you know, because  you never bothered to tell me! It was really annoying!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  giggled weakly. “Well, Kaname only ever said that she was my enemy…  even if I said so, I thought you’d correct me, and that’d just crush my  hope.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re making me the bad guy again,” Kaname muttered, rolling her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that is just an excuse,” Momomi said. “I was too proud to ever say  something like that. I thought you just knew. But I’m not comfortable  with affection and analysis and things… I just like things to be  unspoken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds fine, but it got impossible for me. You should consider other people’s feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why didn’t you ask, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was going to! I spent a whole day working up my courage, too! But you  came late and badly, so I was sick of the whole thing by the time you  got there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Momomi said. “That was cruel. But…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  tried to find her own courage. “But I was scared too. You were so  ambiguous, Kaname, it could have been something really terrible! So I  guess I was just using Olesa as an excuse to run away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed. “I hate it when people wrap things up so neatly. It sounds like  an excuse in itself, life’s more complex than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’ve never really understood myself, either. That’s another problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a silence for a few moments. But it was a little less tense than before. “The lake’s really pretty,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Kaname said. But she was looking up at the sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi took a breath. “And I’m sorry for what I said. About you and Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, that.” Kaname laughed uneasily. “I don’t care about that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  it was a stupid thing for me to say,” Momomi said, twisting her hands  together awkwardly. “Olesa… she said she was the same as you, only her  rival was me. So, I… I guess I mocked you both because it was the  contemptuous, cool thing to do, not because I really believed what I  said. In the end, I wasn’t taking either of you seriously, when you  both deserve it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Olesa somewhat less,” Kaname said, smiling uncertainly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I do support you when you fight Amane,” Momomi said, ignoring the quip.  “Because, I suppose… even though you really aren’t perfect… you deserve  victory more than Amane. And I believe in you, I’m sure you’ll win  someday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,” Kaname said. “I may have been taking myself too seriously, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled at the concession. “I don’t know, but it’s fine. Kaname is like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop referring to me in the third person. It’s creepy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  I didn’t mean what I said.” Kaname was still looking at the sky, but  she was blushing slightly. “Back then, I was angry and upset and I said  a lot of stupid things. I didn’t mean them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m the same. I don’t think either of us should have to apologise for that. It’s just human nature.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”  Kaname shrugged. “Suits me just fine. Was there anything else? Feels  like I’m going down a mental checklist… bugger it. Whatever I’ve done  wrong, I’m sorry, okay? If you’re the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m the same,” Momomi said. “And we won’t argue over who has more to apologise for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. We both know it’s you, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled again, prodding Kaname’s neck and laughing when she went ow. “Just keep telling yourself that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  yeah,” Kaname said, as if remembering something. “You have a really  annoying giggle. It’s very girly, and it makes me feel like I’m being  mocked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s because I am mocking you,” Momomi said  innocently. She relaxed and leaned back, looking up at the sky next to  Kaname. Unlike yesterday, it was clear and cloudless, fresh and cool.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s fine. I have to tolerate worse eccentricities from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you know, it’s very annoying,” Kaname said. “Thanks to you I had to listen to a seriously boring lecture from Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  think that’s bad?” Momomi asked. “I was treated to half an hour  tête-à-tête with Serané, then Kariya said something vaguely encouraging  and I spent the rest of the evening with Shion saying the same damn  things. Oh, and even Olesa and Amiki saw fit to give me advice in their  own weird way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re all such idiots. Wasting their breath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Absolutely,”  Momomi agreed. “The way they built everything up, this has been almost  anticlimactic. Well, apart from the bit where I burst into tears.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, I think I know what you mean,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s better this way. We know we’re both sincere now. I am, Kaname, so  remember it. I only have one friend, so it’s kinda important that I  don’t screw her around. Well, apart from the little things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You and your damn, blasted little things,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Aren’t you forgetting something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  leaned back and turned her head to face her friend, raising her finger  to poke her again. “There’s something important you need to say,  Ka-na-me,” she said, emphasising each syllable with a prod.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright. I get it.” Kaname blushed; eyes still firmly locked on the sky. “You’re my friend too. Not my enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that? You said it so quietly, I didn’t catch all of it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said you’re my friend, you over-dramatic, egocentric maniac! Okay? Happy now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed out loud, long and hard, her shoulders shaking as she felt all  her pent up tension wash out of her, taking away pain and uncertainty  and doubt and all those troublesome things. “My, my,” she managed when  she could speak again. “I should have recorded that. It’ll be a long,  long time before you’ll say anything like that again, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After that reaction? Believe it,” Kaname said, looking annoyed. “I try this sincerity thing and all you do is mock me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m sorry, but it really doesn’t suit you. It’s just too funny. But I’m  sure I could get used to it if you gave me enough time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not exactly that way inclined.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname, you’re so mean,” Momomi chided, taking hold of her arm again. “It’s very upsetting for a poor girl like me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tread carefully, my goodwill is a finite resource, and you’re burning through it pretty fast,” Kaname warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such a shame. Can’t you at least look at me? Those clouds don’t look very exciting to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m rather conscious of what we’d look like if anyone stumbled on us  like that,” Kaname said. “I don’t want any more misunderstandings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if I was to hazard a guess, everyone probably thinks we’re a couple anyway. That would make our argument a lover’s tiff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  just have to correct that mistake,” Kaname growled. “This is why I hate  people, though. They come to idiot assumptions far too easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,” Momomi said thoughtfully. Now, of course, she could remember that other uncertainty of hers. <em>If  Kaname wasn’t confessing to me, then why did I think she might be?  Because it was likely, or because… well, it has to be a matter of the  environment. Everyone’s thinking we’re involved so much it’s starting  to warp my expectations. Something like that. But it’s hardly  important. Certainly too embarrassing to mention to Kaname, as well.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, and I’ll keep helping you,” Kaname said obliviously. “With your parents and with the tests, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Momomi replied. “And I’ll keep mothering you like I always do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. I‘ll be the father figure, beating up anyone who threatens you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that what boyfriends do?” Momomi said, raising her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Older brothers at best,” Kaname replied dismissively. “Don’t get too excited.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, you’d never pass those tests without me. There’s no doubt about that. So it’s not like I have a choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re probably right,” Momomi said diplomatically. “I do need you for that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  yeah,” Kaname said, as if she’d just remembered something. “I had this  letter… well, it’s a bit late, and all, I guess… but… seems a shame to  waste it, you know?” She reached a hand into her blazer pocket and  pulled out a crumpled envelope. “Here. Because I spent a long time on  this, you know. It’d be stupid to just let it rot. You’d better  appreciate the effort I put into it, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes,” Momomi  said, taking the somewhat squished letter and opening the envelope  dextrously. “You know, you shouldn’t keep things like this in your  blazer pockets. Get a folder and put it in your bag there, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t even have my bag on me. Neither do you, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  well, this would be a bigger problem if it was to someone important,”  Momomi said. “They’d mistake it for waste paper and pulp it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So normal people have that kind of apparatus on hand now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wouldn’t put it past Serané, at least,” Momomi speculated. “I’m sure  she’s fond of trees, even if she finds hippies distasteful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,” Kaname said. “She sounds the type.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi picked up the letter and read the first few lines. <em>“Momomi.  I’m writing to you because… I’m not sure, actually. I guess that’s it.  I’m not sure about anything. That’s something that started a long time  ago, because Olesa said you’d use me, and I’d ignore that, but it’s  nothing I find inconceivable…” </em>She smiled at the disjointed prose.  She didn’t smart at the lack of trust any more, the sincere worry and  insecurity was too touching. It was almost cute. She read the rest of  the letter in silence, feeling a stirring melancholy that was really  quite moving. Even if it bordered on incoherence at times, even if it  was rambling and whimsical and dramatic, there was a lot in it. It was  very Kaname. “I’m touched,” she commented, moving onto the final  paragraph. “Is that the word?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>But, I don’t know…it was fun.  Everything. Even when we were just arguing like little kids, that was  fun, and you cut me and I cut you and we both pretended we were unhurt  and sometimes we even believed in that lie… it was tough but I enjoyed  that. I think I need someone by my to hurt me from time to time, or I’d  be a worse person. And I’m sure you’re the same, whether you’d admit it  or not. And when we were together in the canteen, eating breakfast or  lunch, playing with our food and talking about little things, doing our  homework, complaining about anything, planning our campaign, preparing  for the future, everything, the little things that’s common to everyone  and the big things that are unique to us, they’re all important to me.  That’s why I wrote this letter, I think, and it’s why I went so far  before. It matters, and because it matters, I was hurt, and I haven’t  been hurt in a long time because nothing in this school matters. Until  you came, I wasn’t sure why I was in Astraea, I wasn’t exactly sure why  I was alive. You gave me some kind of reason, and that’s why… if it’s a  false one, that will be way too hard for me to accept. But I definitely  need to know. My sincerity. Your feelings. They’re important, like I  said. I’m rambling. Well, I guess the thing is that I really do want  you as my friend, but while that gives me a reason to ask and hope for  a yes it also makes me afraid. If I can’t find the courage to ask, and  you don’t say anything, maybe this will hope. Because I’m hoping that  you’re the same. I’m hoping it’s important to you too.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi dropped the letter and rubbed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, don’t look like that,” Kaname said, snatching the paper away. “You’re making me feel bad again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m definitely not crying,” Momomi said. “I promised us both that I’ve done crying for the day. So don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right,” Kaname said, clutching the letter uncertainly. She gave her friend a half-pleading, half-embarrassed look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was beautiful,” Momomi assured her, smiling brilliantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, there’s no way you’d be able to fake that,” Kaname muttered, turning away in embarrassment.</span></p>
