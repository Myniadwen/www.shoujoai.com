<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>“And, well, that’s about how it is.”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “You’re pretty disinterested, aren’t you? But that’s why I tell you things at all, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m disinterested, but you don’t tell me anything,” Olesa remarked. “You’re quite the hypocrite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  not disinterested, though. You’re interested in watching me fail, or at  the very least, at teasing me.” Momomi grinned. “Don’t try to deny it.  But Amane-san is genuinely ambivalent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad for you, though.” Amane stroked Starbright’s neck. “This is what one calls a happy ending, is it not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh…  I guess so,” Momomi mused. “Though to be honest, it’s more like things  turned out this way. Life’s complicated, things don’t end just like  this, and we’ll have problems in the future. Life isn’t like a story,  something you can cut up into chapters and arrange neatly, with a fixed  ending. There isn’t such a thing as an ending, until I die.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s pretty philosophical, considering she was making a trite comment about your success in romance,” Olesa murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it’s interesting, isn’t it? In stories, you know-” Momomi waved a hand  vaguely. “Most of them start at a given point in someone’s life, and  end with some kind of resolution. But, like I said, life isn’t like  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if every single story was biographical in length, I  suspect authors would be vexed and bored people.” Olesa frowned,  adjusting Ganymede’s reigns slightly and turning the horse to pad after  Starbright. “For a start, the childhood years would be very dull.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. I’m not saying stories should be like they are in real life. That  would just be silly.” Momomi grinned. “But life isn’t a story. Or if it  is, I want to die so old that it’ll be completely impossible for anyone  to write in full.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because life isn’t a story, though, life may  become a story so short that you can write it.” Amane closed her eyes.  “You aren’t protected. You might die young.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah. But what’s the point in thinking like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  how life is.” Amane shrugged. “If you don’t consider such things,  there’s no point in distinguishing stories from real life after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed. “I’m not sure whether that makes sense or not… oh, well. I’ll  let it go, as you sounded intelligent when you said it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, I told you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To acknowledge the possibility of a happy ending… I was right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah,” Momomi muttered. “You and the rest of the world. I still think  that’s dumb luck, though, so I’m not giving any of you any credit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But still. You’re lucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.” Momomi glanced at the blue-haired girl. “So you do have emotions, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably.”  Momomi looked up at the sky again. “But I’m happy right now. It’s  funny, but I was never very happy before. When I was, I ended up being  betrayed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hopefully you won’t make a habit of that.” Olesa  glanced at her briefly, then looked away. “Being betrayed by someone  isn’t enjoyable. We both know that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine, though.” Momomi  frowned. “Have you noticed this strange tendency of the past to absolve  itself over time? Things you consider unforgivable become less and less  important, until they’re just signposts on the path to you becoming who  you are now. No one ever really disapproves of who they are at any  given moment, not in their heart. So after a while you accept what came  before in that light.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know exactly what you mean.” Olesa frowned. “It isn’t a comfortable sensation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes.  But it’s also a good thing, I think. The past can be a prison, of a  kind. By letting those wounds heal in the present we can move on from  the pain, while retaining the growth the experience afforded us.”  Momomi shrugged. “That’s what I think, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That makes sense. But still, it can feel like a betrayal of the past. Sometimes it’s proper to feel pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  suffer or you don’t. There’s no point in pretending.” Momomi glanced at  her. “Even if pain lets us feel self-righteous, it would still be  objectively better for us to move on, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so.”  Olesa tapped her fingers against Ganymede’s bridle. “But it’s  dangerous, when that past pain is a cornerstone of your identity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  That doesn’t apply to you, though.” Momomi grinned. “For you, life is  about the future, right? The future with Amiki and your mother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa stared at her for a moment, looking surprised. Then she closed her eyes and smiled. “You’re right, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I feel rather left out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned and waved her hands. “Sorry, sorry… we were just talking about ourselves, pretty much. Don’t mind it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  understand your sentiments, but you two are different. You understand  each other.” Amane stated this quite factually, as if she was  commenting on the weather.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I wouldn’t go that far…” Momomi said. “We fight a lot and half the time I’ve no idea what she’s thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  half the time I’ve no idea where she’s bothering to think.” Olesa shook  her head. “Most of time, she simply reacts without thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At  least when I think I come up with slightly less crazy answers,” Momomi  retorted. “You still owe me big for the past, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And your family owes me my life as it should have been. I won’t apologise for who I was then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t excuse what you did. I wasn’t even responsible!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That,  in itself, doesn’t change the fact that you are who I ought to be. You  should take responsibility, but you won’t. This will have to be enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not taking responsibility? How about you, after all you did to me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane chuckled softly, instantly stilling the debate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Momomi asked suspiciously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That must have been a pretty amusing nothing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane smiled, fiddling with a strand of her coarse hair. “It wasn’t anything important. But it is funny, how alike you two are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m nothing like her!” Momomi snorted. “She’s an angsty, introverted, calculating egomaniac.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For my part, I also resent being compared to a clueless, noisy, manipulative baboon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’d step outside your passions for a second, you’d notice. You are very similar people, and you have a rapport of a kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Yeah, well, it isn’t exactly a happy rapport.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is enough, isn’t it? You’d both be happier if you’d admitted it.” Amane  glanced at them. “What you said about past pains works well with past  hatreds, as well. You are friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just because you don’t say  much doesn’t mean you can say anything and be right,” Momomi said.  “You’re missing the point. We don’t have to be friends. This is fine in  itself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa nodded. “I would agree with that. Even enemies can understand each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stubborn.” Amane rubbed the back of her head, looking away. “But it must be nice, having someone who understands you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  frowned for a few moments, then smirked. “Okay, no one could miss that.  Do tell, Amane-san, do you have anyone like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned and looked away. “A little too theatrical?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That depends on whether or not we were supposed to notice.” Olesa frowned thoughtfully. “But yes, a little theatrical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In truth, though, I’ve never felt a connection like that with anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  too bad,” Momomi replied, trying to sound sympathetic. “But you’re you,  aren’t you? If you got to know people, I’m sure you’d find someone who  understood you. To be crash, it’s a matter of probability.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.  That isn’t easy…” Amane frowned slightly. “For you, it was easy. Olesa  who always had Amiki. Momomi who chanced upon Kaname. And then each  other. Even for people like you, it was deceptively easy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People like us…” Momomi frowned. “I think I’m being insulted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With good reason,” Olesa replied. “At least be self-aware.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t matter, though. Forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted. “Oh, no, you don’t. Not after you opened up a little for the first time ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on.” Momomi frowned. “You say you wish people understood you, but  you never open up to anyone. Even if they want to you, you keep  everything hidden inside. That’s what I don’t understand. You’re an  extremely defensive person, Amane, even though you shouldn’t be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why? Is there a reason?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “At least tell me why you won’t tell us any more than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged. “Because I don’t know whether I can trust you or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… I guess that makes some sense, even if it annoys me. We haven’t known each other for very long, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  still, what could we do, even if we weren’t trustworthy?” Olesa asked  “You are you and we are who we are. We don’t threaten you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone can be threatened by their own innermost truths.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  frowned. “If not us, then, why not someone else? So many people care  about you. So many people love to watch you and talk about you and  smile at you, so why can’t you at least try to find one of them who you  can trust?” She sighed. “If you’ll forgive me, it’s very arrogant, when  you’re like this. Popular but friendless. And I know you want to have  friends. You’ve made that clear enough…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. Well, the world is  a complicated place.” Amane looked at the girls watching her, eyes  distant. “It’s fine, though. Those thoughts are idle dreams I shouldn’t  disturb you with. This is why I say so little in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed deeply. “If you say so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane fell into a brooding silence, looking at the ground. Starbright flicked his ears at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  rolled her eyes. “But I will say one thing. I don’t know much about  you, Amane-san, and I certainly don’t understand you, though I try  harder. What I do know is that once upon a time I thought I’d never  able to trust anyone at all. I’d been betrayed, after all, by someone I  cared a lot about. At that time, I didn’t have any thoughts but to  distance myself from everyone around me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you implying I’m employing such a primitive defence mechanism?” Amane asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you saying you care if I’m implying that?” Momomi asked. “It doesn’t  matter, right? You don’t care, whatever I say, it’s all the same to  you… that way, I can never say anything that will hurt you. That’s how  it goes, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just frowned, saying nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, I was talking about myself. I kept myself distant,  consciously so. I had my own reasons, my fear of being displaced by my  parents, but it was still a coward’s tactic. If I didn’t care, I  wouldn’t bleed. That was my logic.” Momomi looked at the other two.  “Olesa’s probably aware of that logic. It’s quite seductive. And it  works, on its own terms, it can protect you. But… it always left me  with a hollow feeling. I felt like I didn’t matter to anyone, so I  didn’t matter to myself. I craved recognition on some level, but I  didn’t dare receive it. Well, you’re different from that, Amane-san.  Everyone recognises you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head without replying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, Kaname used the same logic as me, from a similar position…  she protected herself like that. As a result, she was hated. I’m sure  she thought that was fine. But, in the end, she told me about herself.  Pretty much out of the blue.” Momomi chuckled. “It’s a little funny,  actually. After over a year, covering every little facet of herself,  she just snapped and told me everything. Her deepest wounds and  insecurities. If I’d been that way inclined, I could have destroyed her  with them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s strange. Kaname is normally  very reserved and cautious about these things, but she made that huge  leap. Without that, nothing would have happened.” Momomi frowned. “When  I look back on that, I realise that she’s pretty brave after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unexpected of Kenjou,” Amane commented. “But I suppose I don’t know her that well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wonder how things have been, if she hadn’t done that?” Momomi mused.  “Would they always end up like this? Or would they be completely  different?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was what we were talking about initially, isn’t it?” Olesa frowned. “You’re very easily distracted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  yeah…” Momomi nodded, accepting the change of subject. “Well, I don’t  know what the future is. I don’t know whether this is a happy ending.  But I am happy right now, I guess. Compared to that, the sufferings of  my past are meaningless. I’m smarter now, and I can trust her. I’m sure  of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A young girl in love. How sweet.” Olesa rolled her eyes. “Is that how it is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me for being normal.” Momomi folded her arms. “All the same, she’s completely changed me. I’ve changed her, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hope that doesn’t happen every time you get a girlfriend…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  could get back from the summer holidays and find a completely new  person in your skin.” Olesa closed her eyes. “That’d be pretty  inconvenient for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Enough with the sarcasm, already.” Momomi pouted. “You know what I mean. I’m lucky, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really. Probability suggests that there has to be plenty more people in  this school who could fulfil a similar role. If you widen the pool, the  chances of meeting at least one possible partner must surely become a  certainty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “You’re no kind of romantic, are you, Olesa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shrugged. “I’m practical. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright. How about you, though? How are things with you and Amiki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  should I say? Still difficult.” Olesa sighed. “A life that was simple  and pre-determined has become very complicated, and full of hard  decisions. I blame you for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “You’ll thank me eventually. Do you like her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat? Is that even an answer?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, then. But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. How can there be a but? She likes you too, we all know that.”  Momomi frowned. “I scraped by, you should keep up with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  I said, things are complicated.” Olesa frowned. “If my mother hates me,  I would be upset. And if I was in such a relationship, I’m sure she’d  be upset.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t you just hide it from her?” Momomi glared at  her friend. “To be honest, I’m sure you hide everything else from her  anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could do that, but I’m not sure I have it in me.  She’s my weakness.” Olesa sighed. “And my strength. But you must  understand. Things are… complicated. We have an understanding, we know  our feelings are mutual, but she is my servant and we have been  together since childhood. Far more than the friendship between you and  Kaname, if this fell down around us, it could destroy us both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t be so timid. I mean, if you don’t do it, you’re just going to regret not doing it, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We have plenty of time,” Olesa replied evasively. “Patience doesn’t mean we have to regret.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s your business, I’m sure. But it doesn’t seem fair to make her wait  and wait, just for you.” Momomi grinned. “And what would you do if  another girl fell for her? Let her go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa snorted. “As her master, I’d expect… never mind. I don’t know, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  that’s how you feel, you might as well act on it. It saves you the  pressure of having a rival later on.” Momomi smirked. “But don’t get  too complacent. That’s all I’m saying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re talking pretty confidentially considering I was the one giving you advice all of two days ago.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m returning that favour, of course. What do you say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned. “You think about everything. Doesn’t that get a bit boring after a while?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s prudent. You should understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane closed her eyes. “Interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flushed. “Sorry, we’ve been talking without you again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine. I like listening to you two talking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. But what do you think, anyway?” Momomi asked. “I presume you’ve been following this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I don’t know Rivera well enough to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As usual, you’re very precise…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  Perez-san should make her own decision. If it’s made for her and things  go badly, that would hurt too much.” Amane glanced at them briefly.  “That’s how I see it, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s illuminating but not,  perhaps, very useful.” Momomi sighed. “Oh, well. That’s all Olesa would  do anyway. It’d take more than me to break her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. It’s my problem to deal with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “You both lead very interesting lives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty much,” Momomi agreed. “When I look back over the stuff I went through these past few weeks, I can’t disagree with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You involved us in more of it than I would have liked, too.” Olesa shook head. “That was quite annoying, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, shush. You enjoyed it really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The hell I did.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, how about you?” Momomi asked. “Even if you’re being really  gloomy, like you always are, your life is interesting too, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Objectively, yes.” Amane shrugged. “I don’t have strong feelings about it, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As ever, you’re keeping up the act…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not an act.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed. “You’re very tiring. But still, life here has its moments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  just that I have a strange feeling, from time to time, when I look  around.” Amane glanced at her audience again. “It all feels so… fake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “As ever, you can put a negative spin on anything at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Olesa shook her head. “I know what she means, somewhat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi half-shrugged. “Well, fine. Whatever you say…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That play you were doing. How is that going?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  blinked. “You remember that? Well, we’re still struggling through it.  It’s a lot of work, to say the least, especially on top of everything  else. But we should still be finished on time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa nodded. “Certainly, with Shion chasing us…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I never really understood that. Why are you both working so hard on something this difficult? Isn’t it just tiring?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  it’s not like we want too,” Momomi replied. “I just owe Shion a lot for  services rendered. I do have some sense of honour, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More like you’re afraid of all the dirt Shion has on you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  patted Starbright again, watching the horse for a few seconds. “It must  be difficult for you two, though. Working together when you don’t get  on sounds awkward.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We manage somehow. Regardless of our  personal differences, we’re both, frankly, talented at linguistics.”  Momomi smirked. “Something like this isn’t so bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. And what happens when you’re done?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shion gets the script, and does whatever with it, I guess. It’s out of our hands at that point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For a lower school play?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a strange idea, I know, but all Shion’s ideas are strange. I see what  she’s getting at, though. Undue emphasis really is places on the  seniors, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane cocked her head, considering. “Actually, I think I’m a bigger problem case…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I know what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I suppose is that we can do something together, as the younger years.  And we’re taking it seriously, too, which sounds odd, but any idiot can  put together a vaguely funny parody. For our peers, playing something  straight is a lot harder…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded. “You should get involved, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?” Momomi blinked. “You know, we are already. That’s the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As actors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because it would be interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked down and closed her eyes, smiling in bemusement. “That’s always  enough for you, isn’t it? If something’s interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I might.” Momomi opened an eye briefly. “But how about you? Are you going to get involved too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only if it looks interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t hold your breath, though. I dislike having people watch me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that’s why you’re so gloomy all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed. “Well, quite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They go well together, don’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at Amiki, slightly surprised. Recovering her poise, she looked back calmly. “I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  at times like this that remember how different we are, even if we spend  so much time together.” Amiki leaned on the fence, smiling wanly.  “Broadly, she rides the horse. If I’m lucky, I get to hold the bridle,  but for the most part I just watch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “You shouldn’t talk like that. It doesn’t suit you at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha.  It’s not like I’m proud of this, but I can accept it. How about you?”  Amiki looked at her analytically. “Momomi’s much the same. She’s  certainly involving in the school and becoming known. You aren’t. She’s  still the one who leads the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t want to follow her there. But still, I’m not her servant. I’m not like her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose not.” Amiki smirked. “You don’t get paid to be with the one you love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  cocky attitude is a contradiction after your melancholy, isn’t it?”  Kaname folded her arms. “If you’re going to be hypocritical, you should  at least wait a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no contradiction. I like things  like this, for the most part. Olesa is magnificent, so watching her  from afar is enjoyable… it’s a lot easier than ever being directly  involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounds pretty pathetic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, how about you? Don’t you know how difficult it is to get involved?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so. But still, you aren’t making a good account of yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Watching  someone is easier. You can love them or hate them. Someone you call a  friend or someone you call a rival. It doesn’t really matter.” Amiki  smiled. “The principle’s the same. You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. Speak for yourself…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I can live vivid experiences through someone who appears to have no  fear and absolute self-belief. By identifying myself with that person,  I receive a kind of happiness, or at least an ideal. I don’t even  aspire to it. I just watch it from afar.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just too sad, though, isn’t it? If you live like that, you won’t grow at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know.” Amiki looked around. “But you see all the other girls… they  think in the same way as us. To them, Amane is their unapproachable  dream. In that respect, she’s like a star.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etoile, huh?” Kaname sighed. “What a ridiculous title.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know better than that shallow image, though. After all, I’ve known Olesa for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  should think so, under the circumstances.” Kaname stole a glance at the  other girl. Her face was uncharacteristically soft, with no signs of  hostility or impatience. She looked relaxed and surprisingly beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  truth is that Olesa really isn’t that special after all. She’s just a  normal girl, with the same insecurities and fears as everyone else.  She’s just better at pretending, but I can see through that. The Olesa  you know isn’t anything like the real one. That’s why I feel so happy  when she entrusts her thoughts to me.” Amiki adjusted a lock of her  hair distractedly. “You should know a similar story, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. Momomi’s better about being so defensive, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you say that, I’ve never been sure. For you, maybe. But for all her  nice-girl act, I can’t say I know her.” Amiki shrugged. “But Olesa is  troublesome. She drives herself too hard, she’s reckless with her body  and her reputation, and she insists on making everything her own  responsibility. She has grand designs and a great pride, so in the end  she has to work hard and struggle. She suffers, really. Because she  can’t ever let herself be a normal person, or achieve normal happiness.  She lives for something more than that. It worries me a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed quietly. “You too, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  once, I know what you mean. Someone who struggles, sacrifices  themselves and tries to do everything, being guilty for everything and  always choosing the hard path over the easy one… something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki nodded. “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  so troublesome. If only she was more normal, she’d be a lot happier.  But all the same, I like her because she’s not normal. Even if it’s a  real pain sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, for me… I guess I’m the same, after  all.” Amiki closed her eyes. “I'm not sure exactly when it was, but we  were very young. Perhaps when we were nine or ten. Either way, it stuck  in my mind. Some girls had been bullying her, never by touch; they were  more cunning than that. I didn’t know that, though. I just found her  crying behind the school.” She chuckled. “I used to think that Olesa  could never cry. She was always so strong, always so detached… she was  too in control. But she could cry. At first, that shocked me. It was  almost like a betrayal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such a loving childhood friend…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know. But that’s what happens when you discover an idol’s true nature.”  Amiki shrugged. “In any case, I got her to tell me what happened. I  shouted, I think, or something. She wasn’t willing, but she told me. I  found those girls and shouted at them, and when they talked back I just  snapped. I just saw Olesa’s crying face, over and over. In the end it  all came to light when the teachers sorted out the mess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed. “I don’t mean to sound critical, but if you understand moments  like that, why did you put Momomi through the same thing? It isn’t in  good taste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was what she wanted. Olesa, I mean. To be  honest, though, I didn’t like Momomi either. We both had bad  preconceptions and neither of you had done anything to dispel them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it’s our fault now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope. But I make no apologies, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as stubborn and proud as ever. Well, forgive me for not sympathising with you too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise.  You’d do the same thing without remorse.” Amiki watched them ride.  “Nonetheless, I remember that moment quite clearly. It would be too  dramatic to say that from then on I knew I had to protect Olesa.  Children don’t think like that. But I did start to look out for her and  protect her, in my stupid little way. From then, I was determined to be  more than the girl who helped her dress, carried her bags and played  with her while her mother was busy. So I support her. I’ve got into far  more fights than was strictly necessary for that, I’ve got involved in  martial arts and I’ve stepped past my perfect imagining of her. I  listen to her fears and insecurities and provide comfort when I can. I  know why she does what she does and I’ll always be the one to help her  with it. I don’t care what it is. I don’t care who is hurt. I just want  to help her… that’s all.” Amiki’s hands tightened round the fence.  “That’s enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that, what about you?” Kaname  glanced at her face. “You criticise her for being a martyr, but are you  any different? Everything’s subordinate to her desires. If her aims  make you unhappy, you’d still support her. And you give her everything  you have without asking for anything in return. You’re sacrificing  yourself for her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you,” Amiki replied quietly. “This feeling is enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you say that over and over, those words won’t come true, you know.”  Kaname smirked. “As I like to say… this world isn’t that convenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s true that it can be difficult for me too. But she tries so hard  and protects herself so carefully that I’m fine with it. I can give  without receiving anything directly back and still be happy with our  relationship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s still messed up to me. I mean, I’ll borrow your lines. You want her, she wants you, so why not go out or whatever?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve  talked about it. I couldn’t hide something like that from her, no  matter how much I tried…” Amiki’s gaze settled on the grass. “You must  understand, for Olesa everything is about the goal. If we troubled her  mother, or if I stood in the way of her marrying to her advantage…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  chuckled. “Weren’t you listening when Momomi said that? Take  everything. But if you avoid happiness like it’s something to fear for  such feeble reasons, that’s just too pathetic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty arrogant  for someone with so many issues so recently,” Amiki fumed. “We’re not  like you two, you know, so don’t try to make a comparison. We’ve grown  up together and my reason for living is her, as a servant and as a  person. I can’t compromise my duty and I can’t risk losing what we have  already. You two had it easy in comparison…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We had it easy? Oh, come on. You even know she returns your feelings!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For someone like Olesa, her feelings aren’t important,” Amiki snapped. “I told you that, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Olesa  can be an idiot, then. It’s your job to shake her head out of it!”  Kaname retorted. “You want to help her! That’s good! So don’t just take  her words as commands and never question what she does. We both know  that her way of life doesn’t make her happy. By all means, support her  determination, but if she’s being stupid, tell her. And tell her, too,  that you want to go out with her. Honesty is more helpful than going on  with this in silence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know about it? After all  these years, I’m not inclined to change everything because you think  you know everything about everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed. “Don’t pout. It doesn’t suit you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  returned her gaze to the riders. They were heading back to the stables  now, still talking, elegant on horseback. “But still, you should  believe in yourself more. If you were her girlfriend, I know you  recompense her for the difficulties it’d cause her fifty times over.  Making every day better… that’s what you do already. So make her  happier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki flushed. “Is that a vote of confidence from you, of all people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  a less confident person than you appear. I know that, you know why.”  Kaname leaned forwards. “But as an objective observer, I can tell you  that. You’re the one who can make her happy however hard she pushes  herself. If that’s true, it’s also your duty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki snorted. “You make it sound so easy…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You make it sound so hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Touché.” They watched the other three dismounting slowly. “But still, they do go together well, don’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. I’ll admit, it does make me jealous.” Kaname shook her head. “Even now, she spends so much time with Amane…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you call me insecure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, would you like her as competition?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve always thought that might be good. They’d go well together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you seriously saying that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I’m always serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, say that again when you know Amane is after Olesa. Even if you pretend you don’t care, I know better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? The voice of experience?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The voice of common sense. There’s no point in trying to be cool.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Well, not everyone is a jealous, hyper-possessive freak, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  allowed to be a little possessive about the person I like. You, on the  other hand, sacrifice even that thanks to your damn martyr complex…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean I have a sense of perspective, unlike someone I could name?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just grinned and said nothing, walking towards the stables. <em>No matter how much time has passed, or how things have changed, some things will always stay the same. I think I like that.</em></span></p>
