<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We are…  mannequins, perhaps, flung across the sky. It’s so very easy to say you  control your destiny, and so very false. But there is no one power that  pulls the strings. None that I’ve met, anyway. Perhaps that would be  too hard to accept, for me, in this place and this time. But, no, no  one should accept that. No one should accept an overwhelming fate or  destiny, in this world. Could I believe anything but that? Perhaps. But  this is this place, and this is this time. All I see is chance. Chance,  and people. Our lives are defined by people, their presence, their  absence, how they’ve shaped us and how we remember them, how we seem  them and what we intend for them. There are six billion people in this  world. And the free choices, moment by moment, and the arbitrary  fortunes of six billion people makes the destiny of each of them. It’s  not fate, as such. But we’re still puppets, because no one can hope to  control that passage across the sky. Pray, perhaps, to our luck. Lucky  enough that you should come to orbit someone, at some moment, once, and  they you. Is that luck? For me, as me always, would I always be so  lucky? I don’t think so. Before, I’d say that because of </span></em>her. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But in reality, it was because I thought like that, that my luck was never guaranteed. But again, is the luck the wrong word?</span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s easier to think than it is to speak, isn’t it?” Kaname said. “At least for me… always for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What kind of easier is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Easier for your personality? Or easier for you as a person?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I shouldn’t forget. She, too- </em>Kaname sighed. “One or the other or both, I’m not sure. But it eventually became force of habit, and it’s still that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced at her, then looked away again. “You always got by on never  saying anything that was in your thoughts. I let you get away with  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That you surprised me with your flourish,” Kaname said.  “You were much the same. Even now, you’re thinking more than you speak,  just like me. We let each other get away with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everything hinges on what each person thinks,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  part of that is what the other person is thinking. If you don’t talk,  then that will get more and more inaccurate, and it’s so important.”  Kaname shrugged. “We both did it. We were both wrong to assume we could  get away with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. But it’s too late for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not going to let you say that,” Kaname said steadily. “Not yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “Things were so much easier then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For me, at least, things were always, have always been, always will be hard,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And for me, too. That’s what we did tell each other. We hid nothing of our pasts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The present, I wasn’t so good at. But you let me bad at it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not very graceful,” Momomi muttered, looking down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From  now on, I’m only going to tell you the truth. My thoughts, my heart.  Even if I judge that they’ll hurt you… that’s all that I can do. And  more than I did, before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi was silent, watching the leaves flutter in the wind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And don’t say that it’s too late. Not yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You  don’t choose to fall in love. You have no control over even the  smallest crush. It’s brought me the greatest happiness I’ve ever  experienced, in a tainted life. It’s brought me the greatest challenges  and the most painful anguish. And I’ve always kept it all inside, all  my happiness and all my hurt. That’s always been the way I survived. I  used to be proud of it. People need to find pride in themselves,  somewhere, no matter how bad things get. No, they find pride where they  need it, or perhaps where they think they need it. Pride tells you that  what you have done is good. Shame tells you what you have done is bad.  So simple. But human flaw or at least the subjectiveness of humanity  taints them. Good becomes bad, and so fast. Pride becomes shame in a  few breathless instances. That is what I had to discover. Sometimes,  because we’re wrong about what’s good for ourselves. Sometimes because  what’s good for us is bad for others. And sometimes because nothing is  wrong, everything is right, or the opposite…really, finding your way is  very hard. Pride is an unreliable guide. But it’s also been my only  guide, until now, as I reach out. I want to find my way again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re lost, aren’t we?” Momomi said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blinked, then collected herself. “Sorry… but you’re right, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  feel lost,” the brown haired girl said. “I don’t want to be lost and  alone, at least, that’s why I’m here. But I’m still lost, we’re still  lost.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Before, you’d never say such a thing,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. We’d never show that kind of weakness, even to each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s amazing,” Momomi said. “We knew each other so well, and not at all. I’m not making any sense, am I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry,” Kaname said. “I want to listen to you… and I’d never admit  that, before. We were so busy being what we felt we should be we were  never ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s ourselves to be what we felt we should be, not what we are,” Momomi said. “That’s the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But now we’re trying to break that habit,” Kaname said. “It never made us happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her… Amane… she was always herself,” Momomi said. “Is that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Kaname said. “I hated her for that. But you were like me. That’s what  I… me and Amane, we could never have been more different. We had  nothing in common at all. But I knew you were like me, and I always…”  she sighed. “Old habits die hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a couple of liars,” Momomi whispered. “Just a pair of barefaced liars.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  turned and touched her gently on the chin, shifting her face to look at  her. She was afraid to do that, as she hadn’t been in so long, before.  If there was any weakness there, then… it was all over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi met her gaze utterly impassively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what I remembered, most of all,” Kaname said. “You were so strong. So unfathormably strong. You never hesitated at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  that smile. It wasn’t a massive change, if didn’t know that face, every  exquisite detail, the slight twitch of the lips, the subtle way she  moved her neck, the glow of her eyes. But it was a warmth that shot her  through. Whatever they’d lost… the memory of even a moment of that,  would ensure she’d fight to take it all back, until the end. She’d  never say that, not even to Momomi. But that smile said <em>I already know. </em>It was the smile that no one but her had ever seen. It was the smile that said <em>I know you, Kaname. I know everything about you. I knew you, just to look at you. </em>It was an illusion, but if it was that beautiful, she couldn’t help but fall in love with it, over and over.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  barefaced liar,” Momomi said, still smiling. “That was all it ever was,  Kaname. I wanted you to think all that about me. Because you were so  strong, I knew I’d have to be stronger than I’d ever been before. And I  tried and I learned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked down, and smiled herself. “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you believed me, it was all worth it,” Momomi said. “For me, perhaps, but not for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. If you want to, I like it,” Kaname said. “Barefaced liars are beautiful. Truly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then we’re beautiful people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  let go and looked away. “We are. Sometimes I think lying is all I’ve  ever done. Funny, isn’t it? We don’t belong to any club, we’ve never  done much but live, be together, and lie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what we do,”  Momomi said, pulling away slightly. “Shizuma played the piano. Amane  rides a horse. Shion was our council president. But we lie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And we’re talented at that,” Kaname. “We can fake things amazingly. It’s rare we did anything but that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s how we found each other, and how we lived,” Momomi said. “But I’m not sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About what?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We enjoy ourselves, lying to each other. But can we do that, and still tell the truth? About what matters?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We know the lies are lies,” Kaname said. “And still love them. We can do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  thought we knew so much about each other before, too,” Momomi said. “I  don’t want that to happen to me, ever again. And I don’t want to think  that you only love me because I can lie well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We understand  lying,” Kaname said. She paused for a moment, then shrugged. “Truly. We  know it’s nothing more than putting on a coat. You look good in the  coat, Momomi, but it’s the coat that looks good on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll try and believe that,” Momomi said wryly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  lost so much,” Kaname said. “Because of our weaknesses. And even now, I  can leave those weaknesses behind but the catharsis that burned them  away from my flesh has cracked me further. That was another thing I  hated when I saw Aname. Aname was perfect, and I was flawed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think it’s a very stupid person who can fall in love with perfection,”  Momomi said. “You could never be anything but trapped in their dazzling  shadow. I’d hate that light.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re naturally vicious,” Kaname said. “But I admitted it myself, so-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  that’s all I was, anyway,” Momomi said. “I was fooling myself, before.  I stood behind you, and I enjoyed that. But you didn’t need me as much  as I needed you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not true,” Kaname said. “That was never  true. But you were a whole person, and I was cracked. Even now, I wish  I could be whole.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t feel whole. So now we can understand each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  glanced at her, and sighed. “But that was one of the things I realised,  one of the weaknesses I moved beyond. Aname isn’t perfect. I thought I  hated her for being perfect, but I hated the superficial perfection and  the… egocentrism? She lived in her own world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So did we.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  but we saw the world outside,” Kaname said. “So we could twist it, but  we saw it, for what it was. Aname never saw that. She lived for  herself, and damn others. It made me so mad!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  stopped and laughed, running a hand through her hair. “Yes, I used to  take Aname so seriously. But when you really look at it, she’s just  funny. Her own world, and so earnest about it- and this is our Etoile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I preferred Shizuma,” Momomi said. “But Amane and Hikari are… funny, as you say. It’s quite cute, to be honest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  yet, somehow, they shine on dreams,” Kaname said. “But, and that’s the  irony, without us, they’d never have done it. We were hoisted on our  own petard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speaking of that,” Momomi said quietly, “I do believe the princess is passing by now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?” Kaname smiled as she regarded Hikari, walking up the path. “So cute. But the title’s so wasted on her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  leaned back on the bench, folding her arms behind her head.  “Regardless, the tides part. But is it for Hikari? Or is it for the  Etoile-sama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or even for Amane,” Kaname suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes, I’m not sure whether respect’s worth the while. It’s not like most of this school amounts to much, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not to us, anyway,” Kaname said. “It’s always been that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  closed her eyes as Hikari drew closer. “I think that’s a good thing,  myself. We’re not reliant on other people. We both learned the  importance of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the gambit,” Kaname said. “Was it the right thing to do, I wonder-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Um. Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” Kaname looked round. “Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Momomi agreed. “Is there anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari shook her head, looking nervous, but spoke anyway. “Nothing important…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s alright, then,” Kaname said, looking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I was wondering whether you ever got lonely,” Hikari said. “People say… and what you just said…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez, flowers sure are talkative these days,” Kaname said. “Magnanimous, aren’t you? Can a victor afford this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not being very polite,” Hikari said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not polite to listen to other people’s conversations,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t get it,” Kaname said, more directly. “What did Aname send you to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” Hikari said. “I’m just talking to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why would <em>you </em>do that?” Kaname asked. “You’re afraid of me. With good reason. We’re no longer enemies, but that can change fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m doing my duties!” Hikari said. “I can’t just do the ones I enjoy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what duty is this?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  one where I help people who talk like that,” Hikari said. “And I’ve  talked to Aname, too. You don’t have any friends. So, somehow, I  worried about you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t expect us to let you condescend,”  Kaname said. “Just because you’ve got the title, just because you’re  Etoile, that doesn’t mean we’ll respect you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s because I  have to earn that respect, that I’m here! Whether you like it or not.”  Hikari glared down at them, body trembling slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked sidelong at her, cupping her chin in her hands. “That’s more impressive. You could almost pass, like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her, then frowned and shrugged. “I give up. Go away, or sit down. I’m not going to let you look down at me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  her intense surprise, Hikari sat down next to them. Kaname threw an arm  round Momomi and looked at the girl with a carefully crafted expression  of bored interest. “You think we’re lonely, as there’s always, only,  two of us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know whether you feel lonely or not,” Hikari  said. “But if you don’t socialise, then I think that’s bad, for others  as well. And Aname says you’ve only got worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If Aname says all this, why doesn’t she talk to us about it?” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Could  it be that Aname isn’t particularly bothered by this?” Kaname  suggested. “That seems like her. She’s not a naturally compassionate  personality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not true!” Hikari said hotly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t seem to release how lucky you are, to be the one she chose,”  Kaname said. “Think of all those who she ignored before then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not it!” Hikari said. “Aname knew you would never want her to talk to you like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I doubt that was her primary motive,” Momomi said, putting her head on Kaname’s shoulder, “but it’s true enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I already told you,” Hikari said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we have very specific reasons for being alone,” Kaname said. “And no one but us knows them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, normal people really aren’t very interesting,” Momomi said. “So what would be the point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  aren’t tied down by things like that,” Kaname said. “If we can manage  very well on our own, and as that kind of thing would be boring and  difficult, then there’s no reason to do it. We’ve given up on bothering  people, but we don’t expect them to bother us either.” She shrugged.  “It’s that simple. Do you see?” She turned and blinked. “Why are you  upset?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How can you say those things? How can you talk about people like that?” Hikari asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t get so worked up,” Kaname said, sounding puzzled. “We’re just us, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And we said,” Momomi. “People aren’t that interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you think like that?” Hikari asked. “Why are you hiding?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  not hiding,” Kaname said. “Or we wouldn’t be talking to you now. But  people don’t interest us. That’s that. Before, we’d pretend something.  And before, we were bothering people. But now we’re keeping ourselves  to ourselves, and I expect people to return the favour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, you’re hiding,” Hikari said. “You’re hiding from making friends. And you’re even hiding the reason why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re such a bother,” Kaname said. “If you’re so nice, why don’t you leave us be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’re not nice, don’t expect me to be,” Hikari said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve grown stronger,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s nice,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it’s rare that people mind us, and we don’t care about them,” Kaname  said. “That’s just the way things are. So we won’t waste any effort on  it. And don’t mistake it, we’re not lonely. We have each other, and  that’s all we’ve ever needed. We’re strong people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t sound very happy about it,” Hikari began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  smiled, reaching out to touch Momomi’s chin. “Really?” She turned to  look into her lover’s dark brown eyes. “You’d fool me.” She ran a hand  through Momomi’s thick brown hair, smiling as it slid silkily through  her fingers, smiling as they learned closer, eyes reflecting eyes.  Unlike her, cracked, her Momomi was flawless… they kissed. And Momomi  froze. Just for a second. Kaname stared at her, but she’d already  recovered, closing her eyes and returning the kiss passionately. Her  eyes flickered open as she pulled back slightly, knowing and alluring  and entirely Momomi. But that second had been a jarring note in a  familiar, beautiful symphony. Kaname’s mind rang with the echoes of it.  But she controlled herself as well. That was what Momomi had done. That  was what they did. “You see, that’s what we have,” Kaname said. “For a  lot longer than you’ve ever had Aname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And if you don’t have friends, you don’t hurt them so,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  very cruel and unlucky,” Kaname said. “To do that and have to do that  to a friend. And you’re brave, too, to talk to me, of all people. But-”  She stood, grabbing Momomi’s hand and pulling her to her feet. “You’ve  nothing that interests me any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell Aname,”  Kaname said, feeling irritation flare up in her. “We’re not playing any  more.” Before the girl could say anything else, she turned and ran,  dragging Momomi the first few steps. The girl quickly picked up the  pace; running fast and drawing even as they headed towards the forest.  They ran past some of the other girls, but they’d no time for that.  They never had any time for those people.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where are we going?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Away,” Kaname said. “That girl was pissing me off. She’s so irritating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not like you to run away,” Momomi said quietly. She sounded worried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” Kaname said harshly. “But I couldn’t take it any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” Momomi said instinctively. “I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have to apologise!” Kaname shouted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pulled free and stopped, staring at her. “Kaname…” she began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bowed her head, looking away. “You don’t have to apologise!” she said. “Everything’s my fault!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When you pretend,” Kaname said. “To protect my feelings. That hurts most of all. It’s too perfect!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled thinly. “You can’t solve every problem in this world by shouting at them, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re doing it again,” Kaname said, collecting herself. “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Funny,  isn’t it?” Kaname said, staring at her hands. “I can talk a lot, and  act a lot, but it’s just a mask I wear, to hide all those cracks  inside…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname…” Momomi said. “Stop talking about your cracks. Or I’ll slap you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t have fallen for you,” Momomi said. “If you were cracked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But she’s right,” Kaname said. “You’re right. All I can do is run away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you live with the pain, that’s strength,” Momomi said. “Sometimes  running away is the hardest thing to do, but you keep your pride, even  through the pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re doing it again,” Kaname repeated. “I  can’t run forever. So you talk to me. But where does that leave you,  Momomi? You’re not talking to me! You’re just hiding, to make me feel  better. I use you like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I choose to be used,” Momomi said. “I’m strong too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But when you’ve run so far, that the pain’s too great, that you can’t run away any more,” Kaname said. “What will <em>you </em>do, then? If you’re trying to spare my feelings?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked around. “We’re close to the lake, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “Yes. You want to go there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure? You remember, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How could I forget?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled, starting to walk. “I try.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shook her head, quickly catching up and looking about the forest. Light  slashed down through the trees, shining on the fresh spring flowers  that clustered at every break in the trees. It was a beautiful place.  But she never really noticed, all that much. She’d been taught not to  see beauty, and she’d become so good at it… until Momomi had come. A  light that had devoured the darkness, because the darkness had been  weak and she’d burned brighter than stars. The intensity of the little  catlike longhaired girl. Like a lantern. You never saw it as you  stumbled through the darkness, until it was focused, and blasted your  sight away. No, she’d always been brilliant. But Kaname knew,  instinctively, that the radiance she’d never seen before, on that day,  was one that no one had ever seen before. Her Momomi had learned to  keep her emotions locked within her heart, out of sight and mind, until  they were released. And then, they were fascinating. But she used it  like a weapon, in some ways. It was a purifying flame that had cleansed  Kaname, scorched away so much of the corruption that riddled her. But  behind the flame, something dark burned, and even Kaname had never been  allowed to see that. “We need to talk,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded and smiled encouragingly. “Talk, then. I’ll listen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed, resting her head in one hand for a moment. “I don’t believe you, sometimes. You never stop acting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s the worst thing. But I want to tell you something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked into the glade next to the lake. It was beautiful, blue water  sparkling in the light, grass stirred slightly by the wind. But Kaname  could only see that impassively. The weight of memory… that was far  more beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi collapsed onto a bank, leaning back and  looking up at the sky. “It’s a beautiful place. And today, we have it  to ourselves. Just like before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The advantages of not doing clubs,” Kaname said, sitting down by her. “But I’m going to tell you a story.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A story?” Momomi smiled teasingly. “It’s the weather for it, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a story,” Kaname said, looking out over the water of lake. “It’s the  story of a girl who was very beautiful, and very strong, and very  unhappy. She thought she was cracked inside. Whether she was, or not,  there were places in her that hurt no matter how hard she tried to keep  her face calm and serene. Because she’d been taught badly. She was a  woman who’d been taught to be a man. She’d been taught to fight. She’d  been taught to hurt people. She’d been told to take what she liked, if  only she could take it by force. And she’d been taught to survive in an  unbelievably savage environment, a place that broke grown men and  reduced them to sobbing children or worse. That place was where her  father lived. She’d come to survive it, and enjoy it. But it had cut  her deep, and changed her forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Poor girl,” Momomi said. “She sounds really unfortunate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  shouldn’t feel too sorry for her,” Kaname said. “She was a horrible  person. She’d been strong in that savage world, and what she wanted,  she’d taken it. But now she found herself amongst other strong people,  and normal people too, people who didn’t know why they should fear her,  why she should always have her way. And she’d never learned how to deal  with people. She couldn’t make friends, only enemies. She did  everything in the most direct way possible, and that always hurt  people, and her, and gained her nothing. She hadn’t been taught  subtlety. She hadn’t been taught kindness, friendship, love. She tried  to learn on her own, but it was too hard, and she was too proud. So she  was always alone, surrounded by people. And it was all her fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not true,” Momomi said. “All the people who didn’t see. It was their fault. They were stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, they were normal,” Kaname said. “That makes the girl stupid. And there was one more thing. There was a Prince.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s breath caught in her throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  Prince wasn’t unlike the girl,” Kaname said. Her fingers fluttered over  the grass. “The Prince was very beautiful, and very strong, and very  unhappy. But her reasons were different. She was a star, a star that  shone bright in the darkness, and fell on the dreams of everyone. She  was the chosen one. Everything she said and did was perfect. There were  very few in her year that did not fall in love with her, just to see  that. But the Prince was like the girl. She didn’t care for company.  She preferred to be alone. But where the girl reached out, only to  drive everyone else away because of her pride, the Prince turned away.  The Prince could have been friends with anyone she liked, but she chose  not to do so. That annoyed the girl, so much. And no matter what the  girl did, she could never beat the Prince. She could never be anything  like the Prince, because she was a fake and the Prince was real. So she  fought the Prince instead, and they hated each other, and every single  battle, the Prince won. Because she had so many allies, whether she  wanted them or not, the girl could never win. The Prince never knew  that. But she reduced the girl to nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’d think the girl  would hate that Prince,” Kaname said quietly. “And she did. But also,  she really, really wanted to be that Prince. That Prince who defeated  her at everything. If only she was like the Prince, everything would be  okay. She began to obsess over the Prince. Skirmishes became battles,  battles became wars, and every war was lost to the girl. But more and  more, she focused on the Prince, until the Prince defined her very  life. She never understood those feelings until it was far too late.  The Prince was too self-centred to notice. They were both very stupid,  very beautiful, and very alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like us,” Momomi said. But the jest seemed tired, anxious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  scowled, pulling a tuft of grass free and shredding it with deft  fingers. “So the girl fought. And she never stopped fighting, for an  entire year. She fought and fought and fought, until she’d lost  everything, and still she fought. And she was desperate, so she was  violent, savage, and cruel. She had no time for anyone but the Prince,  and even then, only as an antagonist. The sisters despaired. She was  moved to her own room, alone, because of that cruelty, and she was  utterly alone. And then… and then…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A hand gently touched her  shoulder. “I think I know this bit,” Momomi said. She smiled, but it  was weak. And her eyes shone, moist, in the light.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not like you to speak as much as you’d need to,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some  things, you have to do,” Momomi suggested. “But there was another girl.  She came from a land far away, and a family who were very powerful, and  who believed in great things she did not. But she believed in love, and  they did not. She was young, but that was torn from her, and she said  she’d never love again. And she was sent to a far-away land, and a  far-away school, with people she didn’t know. She understood, too, that  there was no point in casting roots any more. There was no point in  friends. She’d only be torn free again, the moment that she’d found  them. And she was thrust into a strange place, and the strange room of  a girl who was always alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll call her the cracked girl,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hate that name for her,” Momomi said. “But the other girl is the mirror  girl, then. People looked into her, and all they saw was themselves.  Because she kept herself locked up tight, within, and hid herself  behind a veil of silver light.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the cracked girl hated her,”  Kaname said. “She seemed too perfect. Until the cracked girl confronted  her, and stared into her eyes, and saw herself looking back. She was  afraid. But she knew what the mirror girl was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the mirror  girl knew what she was,” Momomi said nostalgically. “And for once, the  mirror broke, that time, that confrontation, the pinnacle of a battle.  And even then, they still reflected each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They were  terrified, I remember that,” Kaname said. “But they were proud and  strong and barefaced liars, so they hid that behind hostility and  strength. And they fought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They took it so seriously,” Momomi  said. “And enjoyed it so much.” She looked over the surface of the  lake, and laughed. “It’s funny to think of it. But they enjoyed it,  truly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Neither of them really won,” Kaname said. “And they were  proud, so they never showed that they enjoyed it, but they fought  instead. And for the first time in so long, the cracked girl was able  to forget the Prince. That was a great gift, and when she noticed it  had been given, she was afraid. She grew more and more determined to  win… she focused all her energies on that. And no one else understood.  All they saw was the savage, cracked girl settle at last. They never  saw that battle. That battle that was a new obsession. This impudent,  perfect mirror girl who stood her ground, even in the cracked girl’s  room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the mirror girl, too, she was furious and afraid,”  Momomi said. “Because she remembered her own past, and saw her present,  and feared for her future. Sometimes they were violent. Sometimes,  they’d merely insult each other, loudly and softly, the cruellest barbs  vicious minds could devise. They were smart. And they were silent. They  fought beyond sight, less than literally, but with every word they  said, every action they took, for as long as they were together and  alone. The mirror girl was cut and cut back ten thousand times. But she  never shed a tear, because she would not lose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was a cruel fight,” Kaname said. “Only disturbed children could have fought that battle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,  though they were so caught up in it, they didn’t notice it,” Momomi  said. “They were happy, happier than they’d ever been in their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And they were glad, too, though they didn’t notice it,” Kaname said. “There was someone like them. We weren’t alone any more.”</span></p>
