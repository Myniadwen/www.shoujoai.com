Tamao turns around to find a pair of concerned-looking maroon eyes 
trained on her.

&quot;Oh, hi, Nagisa-chan...&quot;

&quot;Tamao-chan...&quot; Nagisa sits down next to her friend and looks at her 
worriedly. &quot;Please tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot;

Tamao&#39;s depression the last few days had alarmed Nagisa. She had never 
seen her best friend succumb to melancholy. Even after those first few 
difficult weeks when she had started going out with Shizuma, Tamao had 
been energetically, if somewhat painfully, determined to be happy for 
Nagisa&#39;s sake. It had relieved Nagisa later on when Tamao had become 
Miyuki&#39;s prot&eacute;g&eacute; (and she suspected, something more besides) and 
eventually Miator Student Council President - though the relief had been 
tempered by sadness and more than a little jealousy. While she had been 
happy that Tamao had found a way to move on, she had nevertheless been 
pained by the fact that they no longer had much time to spend with each 
other.

But now, suddenly, Tamao had become withdrawn and listless. And, Nagisa 
had observed, she had not spent much time with Miyuki the last few days.

&quot;Tamao-chan?&quot;

Tamao sighs and turns to smile sadly at her best friend.

&quot;Nagisa-chan...Have you and Shizuma-sama ever wondered how things will 
be once she graduates?&quot;

Nagisa is startled by the question. She does not see how it can be 
related to Tamao&#39;s depression, but wants to help her friend in any way 
she can.

&quot;Well...&quot; The red-haired girl hesitates. &quot;I did worry about it a lot at 
first, but you know Shizuma-sama...She&#39;s not one to let concerns about 
the future bother her too much. But when she saw that it was making me 
really anxious, she told me not to worry, that we would still be 
together.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Tamao looks at Nagisa, the expression in her eyes telling the 
red-haired girl that she is somehow counting a lot on the response.

Nagisa pauses a moment, unsure about the kind of response Tamao is 
expecting. &quot;She said that she would work for her family&#39;s firm for a few 
months while preparing for university exams. Both the family company and 
the university she wants to enter are close enough to Astraea Hill that 
she can visit me on weekends. It&#39;ll be...difficult not seeing her 
everyday, but this is honestly the best way for us to still be 
together.&quot;

While Nagisa had been speaking, a tiny spark of an idea had begun to 
glow in Tamao&#39;s mind. Gray eyes widen with a mixture of excitement and 
apprehension. Tamao thinks, It&#39;s not a foolproof plan, but it&#39;s the only 
chance Miyuki-sama and I have! Jumping up, she impulsively grabs Nagisa 
and hugs the red-haired girl hard. Looking fiercely into her best 
friend&#39;s startled eyes, she says:

&quot;I love you, Nagisa-chan. And I really, really owe you for this one.&quot;

With that, the blue-haired girl walks away, leaving a somewhat 
bewildered but nonetheless happy Nagisa.

&quot;Not at all, Tamao-chan.&quot; She says softly towards the retreating back. 
&quot;Not at all.&quot;

~~~~~

&quot;To what do I owe the privilege of a visit from our Miator Student 
Council President?&quot;

Tamao is standing quietly in the greenhouse. In front of her, former 
Etoile Hanazono Shizuma is watering a few potted roses, a sardonic gleam 
in her cat-like green eyes. Just a few months back, Tamao would have 
quailed at the prospect of a private interview with the older woman. 
Today, to her own surprise, she finds herself unfazed by Shizuma&#39;s 
mocking air.

&quot;My sincerest apologies for not calling on you sooner, Shizuma-sama, but 
we have both been preoccupied with...more important things.&quot;

Shizuma raises an eyebrow at Tamao&#39;s smooth response. A tinge of respect 
softens the amused glint in her eyes. The older woman nods slowly at the 
blue-haired girl.

&quot;I can see why Nagisa-san loves you so much, Tamao-san, and why Miyuki 
chose you personally as her...prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Despite your delicate appearance, 
you have a formidable character. But I don&#39;t suppose you came here to 
listen to a discussion of your many admirable traits.&quot;

&quot;No indeed, Shizuma-sama.&quot; Tamao responds evenly. &quot;And if I did, I&#39;m 
sure the discussion wouldn&#39;t take longer than a minute. I&#39;m here, 
Shizuma-sama, to ask for your help in a matter relating to Rokuj?-sama.&quot;

Shizuma resumes watering her roses. &quot;Miyuki is not the type to send 
others in order to ask for help.&quot;

&quot;Rokuj?-sama does not believe she can be helped, so she is not the one 
doing the asking.&quot;

&quot;In that case, Tamao-san, does Miyuki know that she is about to 
be...assisted?&quot;

&quot;Not yet, Shizuma-sama. I would prefer telling her when and only when 
the plans have a little more certainty in their outcome.&quot;

The silver-haired beauty looks away briefly, a faraway gaze in her eyes.

&quot;An arranged marriage is not a thing to be taken lightly or meddled with 
easily, Tamao-san. Miyuki comes from a very old and very distinguished 
family.&quot;

&quot;So do you, Shizuma-sama, yet you are free. Wouldn&#39;t you wish the same 
for Rokuj?-sama?&quot;

Resolute gray eyes look into considering green ones. Moments pass, then 
the former Etoile gives her answer.

&quot;Miyuki deserves the best that life can give her, Tamao-san. If there 
were any way I could help give that to her, I would do it.&quot;

~~~~~

Shizuma listens to the fading sound of Tamao&#39;s footsteps, then puts her 
watering can down with a sigh. She had once believed that she had felt 
all the violent emotions life was capable of inducing in the brief span 
of her eighteen years, but today is the first time she has felt...shame. 
She had known for years that Miyuki resented her arranged marriage, at 
the same time that she had known how desperately Miyuki had loved her. 
Her initial reaction had been a studied ignorance; after Kaori&#39;s death, 
it had become a scornful apathy. Shizuma compares her past indifference 
with Tamao&#39;s current determination, and winces inwardly. Still, she has 
a few weeks left to make up for the past six years. She hopes it will be 
enough.

Chapter End Notes:

The idea for Shizuma&#39;s proposed future following her high school 
graduation is based on an admittedly creative interpretation of her 
family back-story. In one episode (the number of which I can no longer 
recall), it is established that both Shizuma and Miyuki come from old 
and distinguished families. In Episode 12 of the series, both girls are 
shown to have remained at Strawberry House through all six of their 
holidays at the dormitory. Based on those two details, I decided that 
Shizuma was probably a rich orphan raised by a largely indifferent legal 
guardian. This interpretation allows for Shizuma&#39;s considerably greater 
freedom compared to Miyuki. (Miyuki&#39;s reason for not going home for the 
holidays is, I assume, because her parents - cold, proud beings that 
they are - don&#39;t really care whether their daughter is home or not.)

As an additional note, the reader may have been surprised to encounter 
Shizuma at the greenhouse yet again in this chapter, given that she is 
no longer the Etoile. Suffice it to say that Amane, and by extension 
Hikari, have a far greater interest in horses than flowers, and 
willingly and somewhat gratefully allow the former Etoile to go about 
her former gardening duties. As for Shizuma, she simply likes caring for 
the flowers. They remind her of several good memories with Nagisa.

As a final note, the reader may wonder if the treatment of Shizuma at 
the final section is again in keeping with her character. To which I 
respond - Shizuma&#39;s character deserves the right to develop as well. 
Given the fact that Nagisa has helped her overcome her extremely 
prolonged grief over Kaori, the emotional breathing room resulting from 
the removal of all that baggage can only allow her to reflect on her 
behavior towards Miyuki for the past several years. I assume that the 
only possible outcome from such a reflection would be a feeling of 
shame.</pre>
