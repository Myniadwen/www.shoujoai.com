<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, it's  up. This is one of those chapters where I started out with a plan in my  head, got lost, shredded it and followed the characters to what they  quietly insisted was their destination. Hopefully they know best.  </span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi,” Momomi returned. She fought with herself for a moment, then gave up. “You’re a little late, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me,” Kaname said. “I was held back so we could have a special discussion on my History essay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, sweet irony.” They were silent for a few moments, then she spoke again. “So, what are you having? The same old?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right. Everything else is way too expensive for me to accept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Umeboshi and all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Umeboshi and all. I can poison you with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such  a bitter personality. Well, I really should have treated you back when  my finances were more secure. As it is, I’ll probably be worse off than  you are within a week.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’ll be a culture shock for you,” Kaname smirked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’ve always been dependant on my father for money,” Momomi said.  “Something I have been acutely aware of, thank you very much. I’ve  tried to be frugal in my spending habits so as to not leave me morally  impoverished by that dependence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you do have a code, of a  sort. I’m amazed you bother with such trivial things, though. Money is  money. Hypocrisy is a nonsense concern compared with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, would you feel too good mooching freely off a father you hated?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d feel really good,” Kaname said, looking upwards. “I’d be taking his money, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I guess that does make sense,” Momomi conceded. “But the point is that…  I guess I never did want to be one of your stereotyped dependants. The  downside to family money is it comes alongside family duties. Taking it  up is just like signing away my freedom, especially as I’m a second  child.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m somewhat amused that you’d take poverty over freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s not like I want to be poor.” Momomi shrugged. “But I do want to be  able to feel that I stand on my own two feet. Is that really very  alien?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really, I suppose,” Kaname replied. “I can’t say I have particularly strong feelings either way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  to be expected of you,” Momomi said. “But… it’s hard, sometimes, you  know?” She sighed. “I guess fundamentally changing yourself isn’t easy,  especially for thirteen year-olds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t take yourself so seriously. Honestly, you’re way too young to go on guilt trips.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know, but I don’t want to be a child, all the same. I never have done.  Children are so powerless... I don’t like that sensation. It’s not  something I can easily accept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my” Kaname said. “Don’t say strange things at this time of day. This isn’t an appropriate environment, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.” Momomi sighed wistfully. “Just thinking out loud, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you can talk about it some other time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  about you?” Momomi asked. But this time the phrase was friendly, not a  barb. Her eyes were playful again. “Aren’t you someone who wages a war  on her age? And her gender, come to that. You would have been much  happier as a man, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sniffed. “However you look at  it, men in this world have more power and less responsibility. Only an  idiot would want to be a woman.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, but can’t we control man?  I’m given to understand that’s very easy, with the right frame of mind.  Wait for when I’m a beautiful lady.” Momomi smiled. “It’s a natural  thing for those with psychological advantages to have true power.  Strength and endurance, it’s all irrelevant. It’s because you are  simple minded that you’re afraid of that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really do think like that, don’t you. It’s all about manipulation, psychological control.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty  much,” Momomi admitted. “But we’re pretty similar in that neither of us  wants to be powerless. We just differ on our methods, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. But I find your way to be far more sinister.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good. I want a lot of people to have uncertainty when they’re around me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excuse me, can I help you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh? Oh, right…” Momomi remembered herself. “The usual, please. And for her, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  walked back to their habitual table in a corner, half in the shadow of  a large potted plant. They were quiet for a moment and lost in thought  again. She felt slightly foolish and slightly annoyed and slightly  happy, which was very confusing. <em>I was supposed to be angry with  Kaname, but it’s sort of hard to stay angry with her for long. We have  too much in common for that. Playing with her and arguing with her are  far too fun for that. I should be careful, though. Talking freely with  Kaname everywhere, it could be quite compromising at times. Perhaps,  for once, she’s being the pragmatist, reminding me of that. But being  so free with her is fun; it’s not something I’d want to lose on account  of all the idiots around me. On the other hand, for all her posture,  Kaname’s far easier to embarrass than I am. That’s an endearing thing,  but it could get a little frustrating at times.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey. You there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled again, resting her chin on her right hand. “I’m here, don’t worry,” she said. “I was just thinking about you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s too weird a thing to do when I’m right in front of you,” Kaname murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you can be difficult in conversation,” Momomi replied. “So, what to do with your umeboshi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s yours again.” Kaname slid her bento across the table.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you know how to pass food properly now,” Momomi said, extracting the  fruit with her chopsticks. She popped it into her mouth, chewing  thoughtfully. “You know, I’m almost disappointed. I like it when you  fluster.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure you didn’t like it when Shion called it flirting?” Kaname asked. “You’re all ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,” Momomi said. “Perhaps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She leaned forwards, moving deftly and stealing a piece of Kaname’s meat. “Got you,” she said, eating it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What was that for?” Kaname said, annoyed. “The meat’s one of my favourite parts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Retaliation. Never call Momomi Kiyashiki ridiculous while she has chopsticks in hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  Aren’t you the European?” Kaname narrowed her eyes, a smile quirking  her lips. “Don’t underestimate my skill. Against a native, you stand no  chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, before I’ll believe that, you’ll have to show  me,” Momomi replied. “At home, you probably just ate with your hands  anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fighting words, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They stared at each other  for a few moments, neither party moving. Then Kaname lunged, deftly  snatching from of Momomi’s meat and retreating. The other girl  retaliated but she moved her hand, covering Momomi’s target area as she  bit into the meat with a satisfied expression. “So, why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  adjusted the angel of her chopsticks, darting down again. Kaname moved  to block her with her hand, but she pressed down hard, sticking the  sticks between her friend’s finger and thumb. “I’m sorry,” the  brown-haired one said lightly. “My hand slipped, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your brinkshmanship is starting to annoy me,” Kaname said, pulling her sore hand back and raising her chopsticks again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They eyed each other up again, then moved at once. Both froze, chopsticks touching choice morsels in each other’s boxes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Interesting,” Momomi said, trying to keep a straight face. “You can match my speed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was about to say the same thing,” Kaname replied. “But now we appear to be at a stalemate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s lips curled into a thin, calculating smile. “I love a challenge. Very well. One more time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One more time,” Kaname agreed, trying not to laugh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  retreated, eyes still locked. Momomi dipped her chopsticks downwards,  picking up some rice and eating it delicately. Kaname just watched her  with unbroken vigilance. A second later, the brown haired girl moved  again, chopsticks flashing out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname closed hers round the meat  before she could get it, sliding it upwards and holding it tauntingly.  “Too slow.” She slipped it casually into her mouth, chewing with relish.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed, pulling her hand away. Then in an instant she stabbed forwards  again. Kaname moved to intercept, but she brought her left hand round  in one smooth motion, snatching the chopsticks and slicing into an egg.  “Too slow,” she imitated, eating her prize.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned with an overly serious expression. “I guess I underestimated you. That wasn’t bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be too surprised. I may not be as fit as you are, but I have an  artist’s fingers. My hand to eye co-ordination is second to none.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s test that theory against the one with practical skills. Don’t be too proud of a simple party trick.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  holding your chopsticks in your left hand is bad manners,” Momomi said,  changing hands again. “It’s not something I’m proud of. But in times  like this… the important thing is results.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right.”  Kaname snorted, losing the war to keep a straight face. “But you should  be careful. I’m fond of eggs, leave them alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so? Well, if you want eggs, I suggest you come and take them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that an invitation to open war?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing  so dramatic…” Momomi’s smile widened. “You can stop things here. On the  other hand, if you’d prefer to poach my food again, I can’t be held  responsible for the consequences.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t say I’m too bothered,  but egg is egg,” Kaname said. “It’s the principle of the thing. I’ll  definitely make you regret ever beginning this game.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fighting words, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  moved together, catching a piece of meat and an egg respectively. But  this time they didn’t hesitate, grabbing their prizes and returning  them to their mouths as fast as possible. They chewed furiously and  moved quickly, always favouring their opponent’s bento, taking from  their own only to deny the other a precious morsel. Momomi felt her  cheeks distend slightly. She swallowed then stopped, almost choking.  Kaname laughed at the sight, a laugh that quickly became a hacking  cough as she was forced to clear her own throat. And they kept their  guards up, scrutinising the slightest motion, every flicker of their  eyes. They also ate far faster than was healthy. However, with such  constant vigilance, patterns definitely emerged. It became easy to see.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… see,” Momomi mumbled through a mouthful of egg. “Could it be… Kaname doesn’t… like pickles?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,”  Kaname muttered, swallowing. “But I do think-” she swallowed a piece of  meat, “that Momomi… has no taste for fuh… for fish.” She licked her  lips, chopsticks coming to rest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They stared at each other for a  few moments, aware without words of the significance of this  development. With meat and egg all but depleted, everything would come  down to their ability to steal each other’s favourite foods. Whoever  could finish that first would be able to eat the rest freely. Oh, and a  lot of rice. It would be a complete victory. Of course, it would mean  eating the things they hated most. But with the decisiveness in each  other’s eyes, both knew that was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi moved first,  grabbing a piece of fish and transferring it to her mouth just as  Kaname grabbed one of her hated pickles. She winced at the taste,  swallowing quickly. Looking at the unpleasant expression on Kaname’s  face, it was totally worth it. She stabbed out again, frowning as  Kaname subtly shifted her bento. She turned, grabbing another piece,  but the second lost had removed her initial advantage. Moving faster,  she stuffed two more morsels into her mouth as quickly as she could,  but it was plain that Kaname was equally determined. They pressed on,  finishing most of the remaining food within a few seconds. Momomi’s  eyes darted between the two boxes, aiming for the last piece of fish.  Her chopsticks darted out, seizing on it in one decisive motion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  she froze; staring down at Kaname’s chopsticks firmly locked round the  last pickle. “Impossible,” she said, breathing a little faster.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What now?” Kaname asked. She swallowed and promptly had another coughing fit.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  stared at the pickle she actually wanted, then at the fish she had,  then at Kaname, focusing her eyes and estimating the distance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They moved together, chopsticks blurring back and halting, quivering, within an inch of their lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She anticipated my action? </em>Momomi frowned, eyes intense. <em>No,  that’s not it. She came up with an identical plan of attack at the same  moment as I did. We’re truly well matched. No more games, this is a  serious business now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It looks like we’re not getting  anywhere like this,” Kaname observed, trying not to breathe in the  smell of pickle. “How about it? A simple exchange. The pickle to your  box. The fish to mine. It’s the only option you have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She’s  right. Like this, there’s no benefit to be derived from holding out.  This way we’ll draw and mutually gain from the process. It’s impossible  to win outright from this position, and no point in protracting the  struggle. </em>Momomi opened her mouth, about to agree, then stopped.  Her lips curled into a smile again, a smile that made Kaname’s eyebrows  contract slightly. <em>No. It’s not over yet. Kaname has a psychological weakness I lack. If I exploit that, there’s still a chance of total victory.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, you know… isn’t that a bit dull?” Momomi said slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?” Kaname tensed slightly, trying to work out what came next.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  really, this all began because you did such an usual thing yesterday,”  Momomi said. “Isn’t appropriate that it should end like that? I’ll feed  you the fish… but I’m expecting the pickle in return. That way, there’s  no doubt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why should I do something like that?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi leaned forwards, holding her prize just out of reach. “Is there anything wrong? It doesn’t mean anything, does it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. That’s exactly why I won’t do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come  on, you can’t complain like this, now can you?” Momomi said, holding  her chopsticks still closer to Kaname’s lips. “It’s just an exchange.  But, if you really are uncomfortable, I guess you can put yours on my  bento.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname narrowed her eyes, her posture slumping slightly. She made no reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s  right. It’s impossible for an embarrassed and acutely sensitive Kaname  to do something like that. But it’s easy for me, and my position will  be stronger. When she drops the pickle, I have a small chance to  retract the fish and grab my favourite too. With that, I’ve won. </em>Momomi giggled at the thought. “Well,” she said pleasantly. “Shall we begin? My arm’s getting tired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded briefly, raising her arm and shifting the pickle across the table.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi felt triumph wash through her chest. <em>That’s right… just like this-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s eyes narrowed, and she raised her hand, matching Momomi’s posture. “Like this, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  felt frustration and anger flash through her, though she was careful  not to let it show on her face. “Is that fine?” she asked, gazing  intensely into Kaname’s eyes for any sign of weakness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Kaname said. A slight blush tinged her cheeks, but she kept her neck straight, meeting Momomi’s gaze evenly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Impossibly,  Momomi felt her own cheeks warm under the strength of that stare.  Ignoring that, her mind raced, searching for any possible scenario.  Even without moving her eyes, she knew that Kaname’s jaw had tensed as  she made the same calculations. <em>No. This is it. We don’t get  anything better than this. Unless Kaname snaps at the last moment. I  need to apply as much psychological pressure as possible. </em>Momomi  leaned forwards, opening her mouth accommodatingly while maintaining a  blistering eye contact. With her free hand she brushed a lock of her  brown hair away from her eyes in a slow, luxurious movement. It needed  support so she kept that position, her left hand steadying her face as  she approached the target.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blushed even deeper but refused  to back down, opening her mouth and leaning forwards herself. She  raised her left hand slowly, placing it on Momomi’s arm to steady it  across the distance, while keeping it low enough to maintain their  heady staring contest. Momomi had to admire her boldness. She could  feel her rival’s fingers brushing across her skin, separated by nothing  but the silk of her blazer. Even so, there was no way she’d give up,  not even like this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The chopsticks crept forwards, still heavy  and hesitant, neither party wanting to give up. Momomi felt her eyes  start to water. This was getting intolerable. Somehow, they snapped at  the same moment, moving forwards and closing their lips round the food.  Momomi closed her eyes in relief, glad of the release, then opened them  again to find Kaname in a similar position. They both pulled away and  lowered their chopsticks, faces burning. Momomi didn’t even notice the  taste of her pickle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Outrageously, her pulse was racing, and for  a few moments she was completely incapable of meeting Kaname’s eyes.  But that was okay, the blue-haired girl was even worse off. All the  same, though, she’d overestimated her own strength. This was a  dangerous discovery.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, you two really are a couple!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”  Momomi looked up into the obnoxiously enthusiastic face of Hisae Koda,  her classmate most famous for having pulped women’s magazines for  brains. It was predictable for her to draw the wrong conclusion. “No,  nothing like that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on,” Hisae said effusively. “I saw  how you were looking at her. It was really romantic, actually! It’s  nothing to be ashamed of, you know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s just that you’ve completely misinterpreted the situation,” Momomi began. “You see, we were playing a game-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give  it up,” Kaname muttered. She sounded like she’d just witnessed the  futility of existence first hand and was ready to lay down and die  where she stood. Momomi gave her an almost offended look before  registering and following her gaze. They’d attracted some attention.  And several camera phones. The nearest was held by Shion, who waved  enthusiastically. Momomi mentally consigned her to the deepest fires of  hell, a punishment deferred until she had a chance to execute it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh…” she said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,  you know, I’m amazed,” Hisae burbled on. “You two never struck me as  the type to get romantically involved, but here you are. It just goes  to show-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lay off, already,” Momomi said. While Kaname’s  instructions would probably save her a lot of wasted breath if she  followed them, she wasn’t going to give up so easily. “Like I was  trying to see, that’s not the case. We were just playing a game, a race  to see who could eat fastest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname watched grimly as several  other girls approached emboldened by Hisae’s presence and Momomi’s  evident embarrassment. “I’m holding you personally responsible for  this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s unfair! You could have stopped any time you  liked!” Momomi registered that this was giving the wrong impression  again, but it was too late. It would probably be impossible for  anything to generate the correct impression under these circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Evidently  I miscalculated. While we understand what’s a game between us, and my  strategy from that perspective was sound, I repeated my earlier mistake  and failed to account for my surroundings. To fail to consider the  ramifications of that action, what it would appear to a casual or even  fairly close viewer who lacks insight into our personalities- which is  to say everyone- was a fundamental error. I also underestimated  Kaname’s resolve and her effect on me, but while that’s interesting its  relatively incidental. More important is the degree to which I narrow  my perceptions when I’m around her. It must be a result of my social  disengagement, in which she’s the only one I really interact with, but  it’s starting to have significant adverse affects. On top of that, it’s  easy to tell that neither of us are as free of the opinions of others  as we’d like to pretend. It might be the loss of control, in which we  don’t control the terms framing the opinion of the majority. This  definitely isn’t what I intended when I flirted with an idea like this.  And this reality is hard for me to accept. It feels wrong somehow. </em>Momomi put her head in her hands. <em>And  if I frame my thoughts in such scientific terms, I might be able to  avoid going into hysterics. God, god, god! This has to be one of the  worst moments of my life! Note to self; never play stupid games like  that ever again! Ever!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my, you lovebirds have caused  quite a stir,” Shion said, finally breaking through the press to talk  to them. “I’m most impressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your life will be short,” Kaname said. Her words weren’t threatening. They were rich with twisted promise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Totally,” Momomi said, slumping forwards. “But we’ll fill them with exciting events. Exciting, painful events.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on,” Shion said. “You can’t seriously tell me that this wasn’t the  effect you wanted to achieve. You were most intense-looking then that  I’ve ever seen any couple in public. Well, this side of the Etoile  elections!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Believe me, I didn’t intend this!” Momomi snapped. “Though I should have anticipated it, to say the least…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what were you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We were playing who-can-eat-the-most-food. It came to a score draw, but I thought I could bluff my way to victory.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion laughed out loud at her serious expression.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not that funny!” Momomi said. “But I must say with the benefit of  hindsight, I was really badly wrong. Plus this kinda happened… well,  it’s not my fault. It’s all you with your misapprehensions!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  seriously. Playing chicken with food at your age? You’re kidding,  right? You have to be kidding… but it’s you two, so it might even be  true… this is too funny…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It made sense at the time!” Momomi said through gritted teeth. “Now shove off and fetch us some water.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Water?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now we have an awful lot of rice,” the brown-haired girl sighed. “And nothing to eat alongside it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, this is all your fault,” Kaname retorted. “Take responsibility already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You played along just as much…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’ll be right back,” Shion said, smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  let her head slump into her arms for a few more seconds before sitting  up again. There was only one thing that could make this situation any  worse, and so it was inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sure enough, Amiki caught her  eye and made a peace sign. Momomi blearily tried to think of any other  circumstance in which that gesture would be appropriate from her, and  found none. But, just like, Shion’s ridiculous cheerfulness, it was all  too right now. It was incredibly, amazingly frustrating. Infuriating.  It felt like making a mistake, and she hated mistakes with a passion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, I guess this is a draw,” Kaname murmured. “But I’m very surprised that you’d be so forwards, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something  snapped. Momomi slapped her palms against the table and stood, shaking  out her hair angrily. “I guess so,” she said, deceptively calmly.  “Well, I’m going.” She walked away rapidly, ignoring Shion coming the  other way.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stared after her for a moment, looking surprised. Then she got up and followed her. “Where are you going now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to the library,” Momomi snapped. “I have things to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I finish the rice, then?” Shion asked loudly. They ignored her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, are you mad or something?” Kaname asked, sounding almost incredulous. “I’ve said it before, but you started it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course I’m not mad,” Momomi said, shoving her way through the crowds of  the canteen and pushing open the door that lead to the outside. It was  colder than she liked and rather dark, under a brooding sky. But she  could care less right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you certainly sound it,” Kaname said. She bit her lip, looking frustrated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not,” Momomi said tartly. “Don’t worry about it.” She strode on, ignoring the blue-haired girl as best she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  not being very honest. I’m not too surprised about that. But I am  surprised that you’re this worried about what other people think of  you. I thought you didn’t care.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That has nothing to do with  this,” Momomi said. “Those people are all idiots, and idiots can’t be  helped. But I definitely don’t want you to be under any  misapprehensions. I was playing a game.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? It was getting bloody hard to tell, back there. At the very least, I couldn’t tell what game you were playing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?  What did Kaname think, I wonder?” Momomi asked, looking sidelong at her  friend. “I hope you weren’t thinking of anything weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be ridiculous.” Kaname closed her eyes. “It was just your painfully  transparent manipulations. But you can see why people are suspicious.  Even if you say it was just you screwing with my head, it’s too easy to  wonder at the motives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you implying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  saying that your actions overstep that thing Shion calls manners. And  my actions, too. That just makes this kind of thing inevitable!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scowled, making no reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’re such a brilliant manipulator, you should easily have anticipated that,” Kaname said. “Isn’t it obvious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  of course. I thought about this the other day, actually... If we were  regarded as a couple, that could be useful for me, you know. A lot of  this school obsesses in such a way, that much is pretty obvious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  say that, but there’s no way I’d consent to it!” Kaname snapped. “I’ve  stuck my neck out a long way for you, but there are limits at which my  dignity kicks in. I’m not going to accept being regarded as your-  lover. It’s far too shaming.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why did Kaname play such a  game?” Momomi asked. “You, too, must have grasped the oh-so-obvious  significance of what was occurring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I had no intention of letting you beat me, of course,” Kaname muttered. “That hasn’t changed, remember that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s the way it is,” Momomi said, inventing as she went, but adopting  a certain smug tone that she knew was completely, unmistakably her.  “Obviously it’s something that would have to be hidden from my father,  and in that respect perhaps I moved to early. But we already walk  around everywhere together and function as a pair. It wouldn’t  inconvenience you, but it’d be good PR. Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you  seriously saying that we fake being a couple? After that just now?”  Kaname snorted. “You’re longer on talk than you are conviction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yes,” Momomi admitted. “I’ll admit the concept is easier in theory than  practise. I don’t intend to force myself to pretend I like you that  way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m the same way. Doing that just to gain a little ground, isn’t that far too pathetic, even for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  right.” Momomi’s shoulders relaxed slightly at the thought. “You’re  really right. There’s no point in making ourselves sink to that level,  is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. I don’t know… with that kind of thing, it’s  just way too creepy.” Kaname shrugged. “Too much like the arranged  marriage thing you’re running away from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t call rushing into an inevitable conflict running away,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still using deceptive and indirect methods. It’s inevitable, you can’t do anything else. But nothing changes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  flicker of annoyance crossed Momomi’s face before it smoothed into a  blank smile again. She looked sideways innocently. “But, you know, I’m  surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname has very nice eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blushed and looked away. “What are you talking about…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Oh, that was so worth it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  have a really fricking weird sense of humour,” Kaname said. Her lips  twisted into a frown and she stuck her hands into her pockets, looking  out over the forest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed again, tapping Kaname on the cheek. “You’re cute when you’re defensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not funny!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright.” Momomi schooled her features. “I’m sure I haven’t traumatised them too badly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  should agree on this. We shouldn’t joke about things like that. It’s  just annoying, especially after everyone else does the same thing and  draws all the wrong conclusions anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?” Momomi sighed. “But it’s fun to tease you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, it isn’t a joke!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, okay.” Momomi pouted at her friend, who was still facing away. “I get it already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway. I’m off,” Kaname said. “I don’t have anything to do in the library, I’m better organised than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay. Off to sulk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  just snorted and made no reply, walking back the way she came. Momomi  smiled at her retreating back then walked the other way, feeling a  little better. <em>It’s parasitic of me, Kaname, but you really do always cheer me up.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wait.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stopped and blinked, looking over her shoulder again. “Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  was touching a tree with one casual hand, looking at her directly.  There was a tension there, running through her whole body. Momomi  didn’t understand it, but she could see it, all the same. “Listen,”  Kaname began. “After school… before we begin work on the Church again.  Meet me by the lake, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The lake? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have something important to ask,” Kaname said, shifting her weight slightly awkwardly from one foot to the other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Momomi demanded suspiciously. “Can’t you ask me now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It has to be then…” Kaname looked away. “Just turn up, okay? Is that too hard for you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged, reverting to a neutral expression. “Don’t worry, I’ll be  there.” Then she relaxed slightly, smiling again. “This had better be  entertaining, Kaname. You’ve got me all excited, now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure,” Kaname said sarcastically, walking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi watched her go, her expression thoughtful. <em>As  if I didn’t have enough to worry about. Behaviour like that, words like  that, something like that, they’re not Kaname. She’d definitely  building up to something. If…I have to consider it… if she confesses,  what am I going to say? </em>Momomi blushed at the mere thought. <em>It  can’t be anything like that, right? This is Kaname, the girl who  doesn’t like me very much, except to argue with me. She’s strong and  independent and she wouldn’t easily fall in love, least of all with  someone like me, her polar opposite. She was going on about how she  hated the thought of us bein seen as a couple not five minutes ago! On  the other hand, I can’t think of anything else it could be, and I’m not  so naive as to discount the possibility. She’s dishonest, with herself  and me alike, so it wouldn’t be too inconcievable. </em>She put her face in her hands for a moment, trying to choke her flush out. <em>I  shouldn’t have lead her on so much…it’d just be too embarrassing if  that was what this was about. But I can’t help myself around Kaname,  one way or the other, I end up doing stupid things. She has this  presence that’s almost relaxing…so I got carried away in that, I  suppose. But I need to be more careful, for her sake and mine.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The fact remains, though. It’s something I hate to admit, but it’s true, too. I’ve no desire to lose Kaname. </em>She sighed. <em>That  doesn’t speak much for my self-imposed psycological isolation, but  somehow, I don’t care. I just don’t want to be alone again.</em></span></p>
