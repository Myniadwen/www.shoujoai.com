From the Jubilee Edition of the Roman Martyrology, fourth edition:

Saint Spica (Oct. 22)

Good Saint Spica was the daughter of Portuguese sausage packers. At the 
young age of fourteen she joined the Sisters of Our Lady of the 
Unusually Severe Penances. As a missionary in Japan, Saint Spica gave 
her life in order to protect her fellow sisters&#39; sanitary supplies. 
While her fellow sisters were of course saddened by the novice&#39;s 
martyrdom, thanks to her heroic sacrifice the nunnery was able to hold 
out until the cargo ship from Portugal loaded with fresh feminine 
hygiene products arrived for them at the Japanese port, thus saving them 
from having to use those of the godless pagan Japanese natives.

Saint Spica, Patron Saint of Sanitary Napkins, Pray for us.

Amen.

-Chapter 2-

-The Troops are Gathered-

The student council president of St. Spica&#39;s Girl&#39;s Institute looked 
agitated as she wandered the halls of her school. The blonde only had 
half an hour left to find her fellow student council members, and she 
was becoming anxious. She&#39;d looked everywhere for Momori and Kenjou, but 
so far had come up empty. As Toumori was about to begin her search 
again, she heard a sound coming from the rest room to her right and went 
in to investigate.

Sure enough she saw Kenjou with a frightened girl pinned to the linoleum 
floor of the Girl&#39;s Room underneath her as Momori looked on with a 
sinister gleam in her eyes. As Toumori came closer, she saw that the 
girl Kenjou was currently trying to take advantage of was none other 
than Hikari Konohana.

Toumori sighed in relief.

&quot;There you are,&quot; she said as she strode over to Momori and Kenjou, &quot;I&#39;ve 
been looking everywhere for you two.&quot;

&quot;President Toumori-sama,&quot; Hikari cried as the taller girl on top of her 
held her arms pinned to the floor, &quot;You&#39;ve come to save me, I...&quot;

&quot;Not now dear,&quot; Toumori interrupted, &quot;This is student council business.&quot; 
She then looked to her fellow council members, &quot;What are you two up to 
anyway?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Momori explained as she walked over to the president, &quot;You heard 
the announcement this morning. They&#39;re going to close the schools down.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Kenjou added as Hikari squirmed underneath her, &quot;So we figured 
this might be our last chance to deflower Hikari-san here, and...&quot;

Toumori allowed a groan to escape as she brought a hand up to her 
forehead, &quot;Look, the other student council presidents and I are going to 
attempt to sneak off the campus grounds and go see the Bishop to try and 
save the school. I want you two to come with me.&quot;

&quot;The Bishop?&quot; Kenjou asked as she raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Why us?&quot; Momori asked.

&quot;Because this mission may call for deviousness, cunning, and 
underhandedness. And when I think of underhandedness I naturally think 
of you two.&quot;

Both Momori and Kenjou blushed bright red.

&quot;Toumori-sama,&quot; Momori said as tears formed in the corners of her eyes, 
&quot;That&#39;s... That&#39;s the nicest thing anyone&#39;s ever said about us.&quot;

&quot;You honor us,&quot; Kenjou added, &quot;We...&quot;

&quot;Hikari-chan!&quot; a voice called out from outside the Girl&#39;s Room. A second 
later both Yaya and Tsubomi burst into the room.

&quot;Hikari-chan!&quot; Yaya cried as she saw the frightened girl still pinned to 
the floor under Kenjou, &quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot;

&quot;Help!&quot; the girl shrieked, &quot;She&#39;s trying to...&quot;

&quot;Do you three underclassmen MIND?&quot; Toumori hissed, &quot;We&#39;re trying to hold 
a student council meeting here!&quot;

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t,&quot; Tsubomi answered back, &quot;I don&#39;t care if you are the 
student council president around here; if you think we&#39;re going to leave 
our friend here like that you...&quot; the youngest student&#39;s voice was cut 
of as the sounds of galloping was heard in the hallway leading to the 
rest room. Shortly thereafter Amane Otori rode into the bathroom on the 
back of her horse like a prince out of some sort of fairytale.

&quot;Unhand her!&quot; she snarled at Kenjou as she leapt off the horse.

&quot;Amane, are you insane?&quot; Kenjou yelled as she finally got up off of poor 
Hikari, &quot;You can&#39;t ride a horse inside the school grounds!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Momori added, &quot;What the hell do you think this is, Cromartie 
High School?&quot;

&quot;Hikari-chan,&quot; Amane said gently as she held the frightened girl in her 
arms, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

The blonde girl nodded her head, &quot;Amane-sama,&quot; she said, &quot;They&#39;re going 
to sneak off campus. I just heard it from Toumori-sama and the other 
council members.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Yaya asked in shock.

&quot;You can&#39;t do that!&quot; Tsubomi shouted, &quot;You&#39;ll get in trouble if you&#39;re 
off grounds after curfew.&quot;

&quot;(sigh) Terrific,&quot; Toumori groaned, &quot;Now how are we supposed to save the 
school. One of them is sure to tell on us the minute we leave.&quot;

&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Kenjou said with an ominous smile on her face, &quot;Not 
if they come with us...&quot;

------

Over at St. Lulim&#39;s Girl School Chikaru was in the midst of an emergency 
meeting. With her were Hyuuga Kizuna and Natsume Remon. The three girls 
were members of the Cosplay Club, the Secret Club, the Underwater Basket 
Weaving Club, and at least half a dozen other silly sounding groups. If 
anyone could help president Chikaru it was these two.

&quot;I can&#39;t help you,&quot; Hyuuga said.

&quot;Me either,&quot; Natsume added as she adjusted her glasses.

&quot;What do you mean you can&#39;t help?&quot; Chikaru asked, &quot;They&#39;re going to 
close the school. We&#39;ve got to help save it!&quot;

&quot;But what can we do?&quot; Natsume asked, &quot;I mean, this sounds a little too 
big for a small group like us to handle.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Hyuuga said, &quot;You&#39;re talking about sneaking off the campus 
grounds. We could get in a lot of trouble if we&#39;re caught!&quot;

&quot;Look,&quot; the president said determinedly, &quot;We&#39;ve got a large surplus of 
nun habits thanks to the local nunneries hearing about my sewing skills. 
We also have a few leftover costumes that our Cosplay Club made...&quot;

&quot;You mean we&#39;re going to sneak out dressed as nuns?&quot; both her listeners 
asked at once. Before Chikaru could answer, a small knock at the door 
announced they had a visitor. Natsume went over and opened the door, 
only to find cute little Kagome on the other side clutching her teddy 
bear.

&quot;Ohshibaru is sad,&quot; she said, referring to her teddy bear, &quot;He told me 
he doesn&#39;t want the school to close down.

Chikaru put her arm around the little girl and turned to Hyuuga and 
Natsume.

&quot;Girls,&quot; she said, &quot;Can you really look at this sad little girl and her 
teddy bear and not do everything in your power to help?&quot;

&quot;He told me other things too,&quot; Kagome added.

&quot;Y... You&#39;re right,&quot; Hyuuga admitted, &quot;We have to at least try.&quot;

&quot;Even if we do get in trouble with the Head Sister, we&#39;ll do everything 
we can to help you,&quot; Natsume promised.

&quot;Ohshibaru says that the seventh seal has been broken,&quot; Kagome said.

&quot;Great!&quot; Chikaru exclaimed cheerfully, &quot;With the nun habits and the 
Cosplay Costumes we have, we&#39;re sure to pull this off, and...&quot;

&quot;He says there will be a great plague,&quot; Kagome interrupted, &quot;The streets 
will flow with the blood of the nonbelievers... Mmmumph!&quot; Kagome was cut 
off as Chikaru put her hand over her mouth.

&quot;That&#39;s great Kagome,&quot; the Lulim council president said, &quot;Tell you what; 
why don&#39;t you go play with Ohshibaru while me and the girls here discuss 
club business, okay?&quot;

&quot;Well... Okay,&quot; she said as she left the room.

&quot;Right,&quot; Chikaru said as she was sure the younger girl and her teddy 
bear weren&#39;t eavesdropping, &quot;Here&#39;s my plan...&quot;

------

Rokujou frowned as she looked at her watch, &quot;The hour&#39;s almost up,&quot; she 
murmured, &quot;Where are they?&quot;

&quot;Rokujou-sama,&quot; a sweet voice said behind her, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;

The president turned to see Nagisa along with Tamao and Chiyo standing 
in the hallway.

&quot;So,&quot; Rokujou began &quot;Are you ready?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Nagisa admitted, &quot;I&#39;m a bit nervous about sneaking out like 
this...&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Chiyo chimed in.

&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; Tamao said determinedly. She then turned to Nagisa, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry; I&#39;ll be with you, so everything will be okay.&quot;

Nagisa smiled a bit at that, then remembered something, &quot;Where&#39;s 
Etoile-sama?&quot; she asked. The question was barely out of her mouth before 
she felt a pair of arms wrapping snugly around her from behind.

&quot;Right here, Nagisa-chan,&quot; Shizuma answered. All at once Tamao, Chiyo 
and Rokujou gave the pair funny looks. Before anything further could be 
said, Toumori arrived with the delegation from Saint Spica. They were 
soon joined by Chikaru, Hyuuga and Natsume from St. Lulim.

&quot;Well, here we all are,&quot; Toumori said nonchalantly.

&quot;Right, but now what?&quot; Amane asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Shizuma nodded, &quot;How are we supposed to sneak off campus?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve already figured that out,&quot; Chikaru reassured, &quot;Let&#39;s all go to 
St. Lulim&#39;s and I&#39;ll explain.&quot;

And so the delegates from the three schools left St. Miator and headed 
for St. Lulim. As they walked along, Yaya looked sadly at Hikari. If 
only the young blonde could feel for her the way she felt for Amane. Her 
heart ached as she watched her friend...

&quot;Hey you,&quot; a voice whispered, &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

Yaya turned with a start to see two older girls staring at her intently, 
&quot;E... Etoile-sama, Rokujou-sama,&quot; she stammered out nervously under 
their glare, &quot;I wasn&#39;t doing anything, honest.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give us that,&quot; Rokujou said as she narrowed her eyes, &quot;We just 
caught you looking longingly at your roommate over there.&quot;

&quot;Read the Strawberry Dorms manual,&quot; Shizuma added, making sure to keep 
her voice down so the others couldn&#39;t hear what was being said, &quot;Chapter 
twelve, subsection A: Only juniors and seniors are allowed to have 
lesbian angst. It&#39;s the job of the underclassmen to be demure and 
innocent, look kawaii at all times, be the objects of older students&#39; 
lusts, and be used as pawns in senior power plays.&quot;

Yaya looked down, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll try to be more careful 
from now on.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Rokujou reassured, &quot;You&#39;re lucky we caught you though, and 
not Toumori-sama or the other council members from St. Spica.&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; the younger student said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

As Yaya walked away, the Etoile cracked a small smile.

&quot;Kids,&quot; she muttered.

A few minutes later everyone was at St. Lulim&#39;s school, and Chikaru laid 
out her plan.

&quot;Nuns?&quot; Kenjou asked, &quot;You want us to all dress as nuns?&quot;

&quot;Well, unfortunately we don&#39;t have enough habits for all of you,&quot; Hyuuga 
explained.

&quot;Right,&quot; Natsume added, &quot;Which means three of you will have to wear some 
leftover cosplay costumes.&quot;

&quot;What kind of costumes?&quot; Tamao asked.

-A short time later-

&quot;What in the world kind of a nun&#39;s habit is this?&quot; Nagisa asked 
embarrassingly as several of her fellow students eyed her lustfully.

&quot;Well, actually it&#39;s a costume,&quot; Chikaru answered, &quot;The character is a 
nun named Sister Rosette from a series called Chrono Crusade.&quot;

&quot;Look,&quot; Rokujou said as she hastily put a nun&#39;s hood on, &quot;It doesn&#39;t 
have to be perfect. You just have to look enough like a nun to get us 
off campus.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all well and good for them,&quot; Tsubomi said angrily, &quot;But look at 
my costume. Who in the world is Jun the Swallow supposed to be anyways? 
And what in the heck is a &#145;Science Ninja Team?&#39;&quot;

&quot;How are you doing Chiyo-chan?&quot; Tamao asked, &quot;Are you okay in that panda 
costume?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a little hot,&quot; the young girl admitted, &quot;But I&#39;ll be okay, I 
guess.&quot;

As both Kenjou and Momori finished helping each other dress into their 
habits, Rokujou addressed the group.

&quot;Right,&quot; she said, &quot;After we get off the campus grounds, we&#39;ll head for 
the bus depot and travel to the diocesan headquarters in Okinawa. 
Everyone understand? Good, let&#39;s go!&quot;

An hour later, the weary group had finally managed to sneak off campus 
and trek their way to the bus stop, where a surprise was waiting for 
them.

&quot;Kagome-chan?&quot; Chikaru asked in shock as she saw the young girl and her 
teddy bear waiting at the depot for them, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;The Virgin Mary appeared to Ohshibaru,&quot; she explained as she held the 
teddy bear up, &quot;She said that he and I were to accompany the rest of you 
in order to save the school.&quot;

&quot;Your bear talked with the blessed virgin?&quot; Shizuma asked incredulously. 
Toumori shook her head.

&quot;We don&#39;t have time for this,&quot; she moaned, &quot;Okay, you can come too. Now 
come on; we have to buy the tickets.&quot;

And so the fake nuns, the three reluctant cosplayers and the cute yet 
creepy girl with her teddy bear all got bus tickets and soon thereafter 
got on the bus headed for Okinawa. While the older students all sat near 
the front, Chiyo and Tsubomi sat near the back. Chiyo looked over to her 
left to see a young girl like herself who was dressed all in black and 
who was listening to something on a portable CD player. The stranger 
turned to her and smiled pleasantly at the young room temp.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she said curiously as she pulled her earphones off, &quot;Why are 
you dressed as a panda?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to Okinawa to see the Bishop,&quot; she explained. She then looked 
down at the other girl&#39;s CD player, &quot;What are you listening to?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a group called Black Sabbath,&quot; the other girl explained.

&quot;Black Sabbath?&quot; Chiyo asked, &quot;Is that one of those American gospel 
groups? I can remember hearing black gospel music when I was younger and 
my parents let me go to World Youth Day over in Canada. I got to see the 
Pope and...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the girl asked, &quot;Um... No, they&#39;re not exactly gospel.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; the young student said disappointedly. The stranger smiled at her.

&quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; she said reassuringly, &quot;Tell you what; you look like 
an honest person. Here,&quot; she said with a smile as she passed Chiyo her 
CD player, &quot;I&#39;m going to take a quick nap, so you can listen to my Black 
Sabbath CD yourself if you like.&quot;

Chiyo&#39;s eyes widened as she smiled happily, &quot;Really? Oh, thank you.&quot;

&quot;Think nothing of it,&quot; she said as she helped the girl put the earphones 
on and hit play. She then lay back and took a nap.

And so, as sweet innocent little Chiyo listened to the musical stylings 
of Black Sabbath, a conversation was going on elsewhere on the bus.

&quot;So,&quot; Yaya said with a smile, &quot;How many of you have parents who bar you 
from watching TV?&quot; she asked. Several hands went up.

&quot;My father calls it &#145;hellavision,&#39;&quot; Hikari explained.

&quot;Mine too,&quot; Tamao put in.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen TV once,&quot; Nagisa said.

&quot;Really?&quot; Tamao asked.

&quot;Why Nagisa-chan,&quot; Shizuma teased, &quot;You&#39;ve been holding out on us.&quot;

&quot;What was the show about?&quot; Chikaru asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; Nagisa began, &quot;It was all about a man with a beard who saved the 
world.&quot;

&quot;A man with a beard who saved the world?&quot; Hikari asked, &quot;You mean our 
Lord who saved mankind through his redemptive suffering on the...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Nagisa answered, &quot;This man wasn&#39;t our Lord. He was an American 
named Chuck Norris, who saved the world from a group of terrorist by 
delivering roundhouse kicks to their faces and punching his fist through 
their leader&#39;s ribcage.&quot;

Her listeners gave her a funny look.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound very edifying,&quot; Toumori muttered.

And so the conversations continued as they traveled on to Okinawa...

-To Be Continued-

-Epilogue-

&quot;Hello, Chikaru here. It seems like there&#39;s an awful lot of fans of 
Strawberry Panic out there, but the various relationships in the series 
can leave some people confused. So, with the help of the Secret Club, 
I&#39;ve compiled these charts to help out.&quot;

&quot;Now here we have the chart for St. Miator. As you can see, The Etoile, 
Shizuma-sama, has feelings for Nagisa. Also, Nagisa is starting to 
possibly have feelings for the Etoile. This situation is complicated 
however by the fact that both Nagisa&#39;s roommate Tamao-chan and their 
young room temp Chiyo also have feelings for the redhead. And let&#39;s not 
forget Miator council president Rokujou, who may or may not have had a 
relationship with Shizuma at some time in the past and who may still be 
harboring feelings for her.&quot;

&quot;On the chart for St. Spica, we see that both Hikari-chan and Amane-sama 
have feelings for one another. Now in this case, the complications arise 
from both her roommate Yaya and the young Tsubomi-chan also having 
feelings for her, and the villainous lesbian couple Momori and Kenjou of 
the student council who are trying to keep Hikari and Amane apart in 
order to use Amane in a bid to steal the post of Etoile from 
Shizuma-sama.&quot;

&quot;Finally, we have St. Lulim&#39;s chart. This is probably the easiest set of 
relationships of all to keep track of. You see, my friends Natsume-chan 
and Hyuuga-chan are quite possibly a couple, Kagome is in love with her 
teddy bear Ohshibaru, the teddy bear however is in love with me, and I&#39;m 
as yet not involved with anyone.&quot;

&quot;If any of you reading this out there are still confused, you&#39;re not 
alone. Two years ago when I was confirmed by the Bishop I had no idea 
being a Catholic girl could be so difficult! Anyways, see you all again 
next episode. Sayonara.&quot;</pre>
