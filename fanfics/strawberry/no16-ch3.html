Was what my horoscope said.

I never was the type to listen to it... but I did so today.

I hoped a little that it was true.

It started awfully...

Sei-senpai being annoying so early in the morning.

And soon... I&#39;ve all but forgotten,

about that little message on that cheap morning newspaper.

I probably won&#39;t be reading my horoscope anytime soon...

It always seems to be wrong or the opposite for me.

You&#39;re probably asking why I say so...

Well...

The one person I&#39;d probably expected never to see again...

Maybe...

Even wished never to see again...

Greeted me with today...

With that same heart breaking smile...

...from six years ago.
