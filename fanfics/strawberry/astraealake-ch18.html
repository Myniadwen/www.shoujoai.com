<p>“So, here we are.” Shion sat on her bed. “What do you think?”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s very neat.” Momomi looked around. “I suppose that’s what I expected from you, though. You have that kind of personality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Definitely.”  Momomi scrutinised the room more closely. From the books stacked neatly  on shelves to the ordered writing desk to the laptop placed neatly next  to the wall’s power socket, it all spoke of a studious and hard-working  student. “Lacks personality, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t mince your  words, do you?” Shion said. “Well, I’ve always been that way. I don’t  suppose I’m particularly remarkable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stood and walked over to the laptop, opening it up and pressing the on button.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey! What are you doing?” Shion stood, plainly agitated. “Don’t just go looking at that without a word!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re definitely hiding something interesting,” Momomi said, sitting down. “I’m going to find it, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said don’t touch that,” Shion said, reaching over and trying  unsuccessfully to restrain the younger girl. “Respect my privacy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,  now you have me really interested,” Momomi teased. “Does Shion-senpai  have a lot of dirty files on her computer, I wonder?” She clicked on  Shion’s account, smiling. “Really, I know XP defaults to passwords off,  but you shouldn’t be so careless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t have anything  pornographic on there, no,” Shion said, ignoring this. “But all the  same, I would like you to stop, already! It’s not polite!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at the background. “Huh? What’s this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion just sighed in exasperation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  clicked on “My Computer” then hovered over the main hard drive,  smiling. “My, my, only a few gigabytes of space left on such a large  hard drive. What are you hiding, Shion-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop it, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  Documents… well, what do we have here… downloads? Now let’s see what’s  in here… a whole lot of video files, I see. Well, isn’t this  interesting?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop it, already!” Shion said, blushing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  you’re going all red, I see,” Momomi said. “I wonder.” She  double-clicked on the closest file, then clicked forwards to a random  moment and frowned again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;Of all the preposterous assumptions of  humanity, nothing exceeds the criticisms made of the habits of the poor  by the well-housed, well-warmed, and well-fed…&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell’s this? A social documentary? And in English, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it looks like I’ve been found out,” Shion sighed, taking over and  clicking back to the start. “This is a police drama in English.  Criminal Minds. I’m also watching Without a Trace, The Closer and  several others right now as they come out, as well as downloading past  series. It’s my hobby. It keeps my English fluent and they’re mildly  diverting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You watch foreign police dramas for your hobby?” Momomi asked. “What’s wrong with Japanese ones?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone  knows that things that come from far away are better, right?” Shion  grinned with an uncharacteristic enthusiasm. “It’s a little silly, I  know, but I enjoy them. Besides, they’re rooted in a culture far  different from our own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somehow I don’t think you’re getting the world’s most accurate picture of their culture,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course. But it’s better than nothing, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  that was what was with the desktop, too,” Momomi said. “I knew you had  to have at least one weird hobby, everyone has one. Is this legal,  though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s… legally ambiguous,” Shion said evasively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  never mind. Far be it from me to chide an honour student.” Momomi  clicked back and was about to relinquish control of the computer when  she spotted another folder, this one simply marked “Files”. She  double-clicked it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t look at that one!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What now…”  Momomi frowned, her face changing abruptly as she saw the list of word  documents, neatly listed in alphabetical order. The first think that  caught her eye was <em>Phareli/Kiyashiki, Momomi. Perez, Olesa </em>preceded  it, and there were plenty of other names, too. She scanned the list  arbitrarily, picking out a lot of names that meant something to her and  a few that did not. <em>Kenjou, Kaname. Rivera, Alicia/Amiki. Deralna,  Serané. Nakano, Kariya. Ohtori, Amane. Nii, Namiko. Koga, Chisaki.  Hanazono, Shizuma. Kai, Touko. </em>“What the hell is this? It looks like half the school is here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve got less than a hundred names,” Shion said. “Only the ones of especial interest get a file.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Should  I be flattered or queasy?” Momomi clicked on her own name, reading  aloud. “Phareli Momomi, adoptive surname Kiyashiki, from her mother.  Born 12th April 1991. Blood Type AB. Height… what the hell is this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  took the laptop from her, closing the lid. “At this point, I’ll have to  stop you. Not for myself. But there are a lot of secrets recorded on  those files, and I don’t intend to cause any distress to others by  revealing them to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her. “You really are a stalker!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  such an unflattering term,” Shion said, smiling thinly. “Half of this  information can be gathered by a simple google search, you know, many  of my subjects are famous enough. As for the rest... we live in an  information age. I’m just keeping my weapons close to hand, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her senpai with a mix of awe and dismay. “Now, that can’t be legal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s legally ambiguous, again. Make of it what you will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can I at least see my own file? I want to make sure there’s nothing dirty on there!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know your own life, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked up curiously. “How about other people? The Etoiles? Their files were the biggest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No is no,” Shion said, working rapidly with the computer. “Many people have secrets in this world, Momomi-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, plainly not, you know them all,” Momomi grumbled. She watched Shion’s actions surruptitiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  become accustomed to playing the role of secret keeper,” Shion said,  pressing enter. “Well, I’ve placed a password on that folder, and I’ll  put one on my account, as well. If nothing else, you’ve motivated me to  improve my security.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, whatever,” Momomi said. “If it makes you happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite.  Well, no hard feelings,” Shion said, smiling and touching her shoulder.  “You get off better than some people. I’ll delete your file, if you  like.” She did so, though Momomi knew that she’d only sent it to the  recycle bin. She felt, with a certainty, that Shion would restore it  later, and even if she didn’t, she’d rewrite it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I could report you to the Etoiles, you know,” she ventured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, they know all about my archives,” Shion said sweetly. “I told them all about it and they never pressed me on the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… see.” Momomi wondered what kind of dirt Shion had on them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can tell you some interesting things that aren’t compromising, though,”  Shion said, leading her back to her new bed and sitting her down.  “Well, compromising in the sense of embarrassment only. Serané-sama  enjoys reading shoujo manga and girls love works, much to Kariya-sama’s  distaste. Kariya-sama herself is a sixth-Dan practitioner of kendo and  keeps a fully sized, authentic handmade Nihonto katana and wakizashi  daishō in her room. However, she also enjoys watching chick-flicks with  Serané-sama, which would probably compromise her samurai act if it was  generally known. Perez-san spends her spare time studying the stock  market, perfecting her command of Japanese and playing Starcraft  online. Rivera-san is frequently her teammate. I watch western police  dramas, as you know. Rokujō-san is, of course, one of the two  wealthiest aristocrats in the school, along with her contemporary  Hanazono-san. However, despite her infamous ability with numbers she  spends more of her spare time in creative writing. No one is completely  what they portray to the school as a whole, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do you find this stuff out?” Momomi asked, shaking her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  the most part? I ask. If you’re polite enough and sound interested  enough you can learn a lot about a person’s interests from what they  say. Often far too much. But I do have an interest in these things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about Amane?” Momomi said, intrigued despite herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  shrugged and smiled, sitting opposite her. “I’m afraid Ohtori-san is  everything she appears to be, as far as I can tell. Her life is horse  racing. But I always like to imagine that she spends her time writing  boy-on-boy fanfiction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Boy-on-boy? In this school? Now that is unlikely. Girl-on-girl, I can see. I wouldn’t put it past her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She does seem the type, now doesn’t she?” Shion said, smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi lay back on her bed, looking at the ceiling and wondering-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you know, I’m being a little selfish,” Shion said, leaning forwards.  “I’m somewhat glad that you’re here. I haven’t had a room-mate for  months and months, ever since Isae-chan left.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isae-chan?” Momomi said, turning her head to look at her senpai. There was a surprising wistfulness in that tone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right,” Shion said. “My old roommate. We were best friends back in our  first year here. I suppose it’s inevitable, of course, when you have to  sleep in the same room as someone. But she was a very sweet girl. She  cried on her first night because she missed her family, and though  she’s hardly the first to do that, it was very memorable for me. After  that, we just came to talk about things, and ate lunch together, and  worked on our homework together. It was nice, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Momomi muttered. “I think I know what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  appeared too lost in reminiscence to notice her kohai’s discomfort. “We  were actually pretty far apart in terms of personality and things. Once  Isae had got over her homesickness, she was a very social girl, where  I’ve always preferred to watch from the sidelines. She tended to drag  me into things a lot. And she was terrible academically, so I always  had to teach her how to do things, but she was very good at sports  which was always rather embarrassing. Spica is the academy of sporting  excellence, among other things, but I can’t say I’ve ever made the  effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s hard to believe that you two were friends,” Momomi said, more to say something than for its worth as an observation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  right,” Shion mused, “but I suppose it was precisely because we were so  different that we became friends. It was… interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did she leave?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  she didn’t want to,” Shion said. “But her parents were moving oversees  because her father had been transferred, and so they wanted to take her  with them. She wanted to stay here, but they overruled her, and so she  left. We still write but it’s not the same.” She sighed. “And ever  since then I’ve been alone in here. Well, I guess I’m done moping now.  Sorry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine. I’m interested to learn things about you, Shion-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  none of that is information that can be used against me,” Shion teased.  “This is just a curiosity of my past, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And when did you start to assemble those files?” Momomi probed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After  she left. You’re right, Kiyashiki-san, I do have too much free time on  my hands, but I have to keep busy. There’s no point in sulking and  doing nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. But don’t you have other friends?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really. Like I said, I’m not a naturally social personality. I prefer  keeping a little distance between myself and other people. Well, I’m  sure you’ll be able to sympathise with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right. It’s not like I’m any different. But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?” Shion queried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a shame. Someone like you should be popular, I think. But I guess if  you were, you wouldn’t have any time to hang around with your juniors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  quite. I prefer being useful to being popular, myself. It’s a role I’m  happy with. But I have a special reason to take an interest in you,  Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I’m beautiful and smart, right? I can help you win your crusade for Spica, or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  true enough, but not what I meant,” Shion said, shaking her finger.  “But for you who is fighting her parents to stay at this school, I’m  committed to help, because it’s an emotive cause for me. I wouldn’t  like to see you have to leave here against your will, leaving  Kenjou-kun behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right,” Momomi said, looking down. “She doesn’t care whether I stay or go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  sighed audibly. “That is possible, but I really don’t think so. You  shouldn’t be so discouraged, Kiyashiki-san. I’ve seen friendships  recover from worse than this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, yeah? Such as?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  Etoiles, for a start,” Shion said. “Even in my personal memory they’ve  had blazing rows. Of course, any row with Serané-sama in it is going to  be a genteel row, but they blaze away all the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Etoiles  are the Etoiles, though.” Momomi picked at the bedcovers. “They’re  lovers and they fit each other so well, it’s like… they’re not  balanced, without each other, or something like that. Two very  different personalities, but between them they make one normal person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know the feeling. Though I’d call the normal person a genius. But even  they started as two souls apart, Kiyashiki-san. No one comes into this  world with their partner, they have to go through the inconvenience of  finding them first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That still doesn’t apply to me. Even if I  still want to be Kaname’s friend, that doesn’t mean she wants me to be  her friend. I can tell that much. She thinks I was using her, and she  wasn’t all wrong, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not as complex and understanding  as Serané-sama,” Shion said, tilting Momomi’s chin up and meeting her  eyes. “I’m certainly not as experienced, either. But I know what it  means to lose a best friend, Kiyashiki-san. I don’t recommend the  experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, already,” Momomi said, turning away. “But that doesn’t mean I know what to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure you’ll find the way,” Shion said. “Because I believe that she’s thinking the same things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish I could believe that.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Damn  blasted Kariya and her damn blasted arrogant attitude… so annoying.  It’s not like I don’t understand everything she said! I knew most of  that before, too. But she makes it sound far too easy, by just saying  it. That seriously pisses me off. </span></em>Kaname had cleared space in the centre of the room. She took a stance, ready to work through one of her kata. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  haven’t practised in way too long, I bet my technique and power have  both gone to hell. Well, it’s not like I need it in a school like this.  I can deal with Amiki even on one of my off-days, and no one else even  comes close, not in our year anyway. </span></em>She began with her fists  meeting, one on top of the other, just above her chest. She turned and  swung her fist to the right, before turning and placing the left fist  on top this time. A moment later she’d punched out to the left,  completing the second movement. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ha. This reminds me of the time I  was thrown out of the karate club. So what if it wasn’t part of the  movement to jump forwards and bowl them over before putting them in a  chokehold…I’ve been in a fair few real fights and I can’t remember the  last time anyone’s told me what they were going to do before they did  them. It’s just bad practise. </span></em>She turned sideways, raising her  hands over her head and crossing the fingers, thumb meeting thumb, her  legs spread. An instant later, her right hand chopped forwards in a  classic slashing motion, as far as she could reach. She snapped her  left hand forwards to match, curling her fingers into fists, then  pulled her right hand back, her left folding out again. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s a pity  we don’t do boxing. That’s not real fighting, either, but it’s closer.  I guess there really isn’t enough demand in a girl’s school. I should  transfer to Lulim and form a one-man club. That’d solve the problem. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  turned, crossing her hands again, this time at chest height. Her right  hand cut out again, this time with a palm strike. An imaginary opponent  staggered back, winded badly. <em>This is strength. The ability to  fight, with and without weapons, that’s the most fundamental aspect of  mankind. It’s one that’s been lost in so many places, thanks to that  beautiful illusion called civilisation. But it was alive in my father  and my home and my life, and it’s alive in me. The ability to hurt  someone more than they hurt you, exerting yourself over them,  regardless of the injury they inflict on you. </em>She brought her  hands up to head height, snapping her left arm forwards then pulling it  back just as fast. She followed this by sweeping her hands down low,  fingers first, in a spearhand strike. <em>But what is it for? Strength?  There was my father, who lived by it, selling himself to bully others  because he had power and they did not, and he died by that. Then you  can use to gratify yourself, to prop up a pathetic, pointless pride and  dignity by hurting others and throwing yourself around until there’s  nothing left of you. I never did that, but I’ve come close, I’ve come  far too close for my liking. Too many times, physical harm is the only  way I’ve been able to touch those above me. It’s a foolish use of  power, though, to stake your whole pride on something as barbaric as  that. </em>Now her hands revolved her body rapidly, alternating high  and low strikes in quick succession. She finished by punching low and  spinning her fists up and outwards, crossing over each other, one  raised, one at waist height. <em>I used to think that there was nothing  but that. After all, force is a vulgar thing and I’ve seen it used so  much for the worst parts of mankind. We’ve created a world in which  violence is always a negative, for better or for worse. I’ve never  known quite what to make of that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname kicked, her leg  snapping up to waist height. She remained in that position for a few  moments, testing her strength and balance, before she slammed it down  and brought both her hands up in the Te-gatana position. She swept  forwards, completing a circle, paused for a second, then turned deftly  and slashed down the other way, fingers first. <em>I’ve been fighting  in the same old ways for months and months, fighting Amiki because she  tormented me and even attacking Olesa because I knew she was the one  behind it all. But even though I won those fights, there was something  more painful than my mere injuries every time. I knew, they knew, that  it was just petulance, a poor second that just showed I couldn’t deal  with their main line of attack. And to her credit, not even Olesa has  ever feared me for that. </em>She crossed her arms then retracted them,  holding them both at shoulder height, her fingers curled into fists.  They were raised over her head and crossed again, then she delicately  lifted her right leg, sliding it behind her left and lowering her hands  to help her balance. She maintained that position for several seconds. <em>But  there was one time when it didn’t feel like that, when it didn’t feel  like defeat. When I protected Momomi. It felt so good at the time, but  of course it would do. I won’t let anyone hurt her. I’ll be the injured  one instead, I’ll do that if it will ease her pain, because she’s mine  to protect. And for that, I’ll give anything. Those sweet lies have  haunted mankind for generations. But in the end, it’s just  self-gratification.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname struck forwards with both fists rather more vigorously than necessary, imagining a certain baby-faced brunette. <em>But she’s not afraid of being hurt, either. That would only show that she’s got to me. </em>She  peeled her hands apart, her left pulling back the waist while the right  chopped forwards again. That hand dropped to her side then lashed up  and out in a two-fingered strike. She alternated the move, attacking in  the same way with her other hand, then punched forwards with both fists  apart. <em>To protect her from harm, that was something I enjoyed. And  I hated Amiki, not just for myself, but because she had hurt Momomi. I  said it was because of my hate for the other two. I was lying, though.  I was avenging Momomi and even though it would trouble us both, even  though I was being hurt and badly, I felt good at the time. </em>She  spread her legs and arms, stepping forwards and punching again. Her  right hand flipped back, covering her body, while the left moved behind  it, covering her chest. She chopped forwards with her right hand once  more before curling it into a fist and meeting her left hand at arm’s  length. <em>I even apologised to her later for doing that, because I  was a good little tool and I was worried, worried, that I was troubling  her plans. Things were a lot simpler than. I could accept everything  she said on faith and I thought I was helping her out of my own free  will. I never thought that she might be making my mind up for me, with  her words and actions, and so I could believe in her, believe in  myself. That’s gone now. Probably for good.</em></span></p>
She changed  positions, covering her body with her left hand then performing a  Te-gatana strike with it. Her hands met in front of her as fists again,  completing the mirror. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before, I had a sense of purpose, but now  it’s gone again, blown away. I suppose that’s inevitable when you do  something so stupid as to put your faith and strength into someone  else’s dreams. I won’t make that mistake again. I can find a new  reason, and when I have that, there won’t be any reason to go back. </span></em>She raised her fists to her mouth, breathing out, then dropped her hands to her sides, completing the kata. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  parasitic to grab onto someone else’s intentions and say that they’re  your own, that you’ll fight for them with all your strength. It’s just  like Amiki, a stupid dependency, a complete debasing loyalty where  you’ve given over yourself as a person to someone else. And then they  can’t see you as anything but a slave, and it gets harder and harder to  blame them. I have my own dreams. I got to this school with my own  will, my own strength and my own determination to escape the fate that  life had thrust upon me. I’m not someone who has to sacrifice myself to  another as if it’s the only thing I have the wit and ability to do. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She bit her lip and adopted the first position again, intending to work out her rising frustration. <em>But  I have to ask myself, don’t I? What happened, Kaname? What happened to  that Kaname, the one who had dreams and a will to realise them? What  would she think about the girl who spends her life vegetating in her  room, without a desire in her head? Sometimes I wonder whether I really  have been broken by all those snide little catholic schoolgirls and  their snide little looks and gossip and glances. Momomi… Momomi brought  the fire back. It sickens me, but the more I think, the more I realise  the extend of my dependence. And like any addictive habit, it’s not  something I notice until it’s been taken away from me. Pathetic. </em>Kaname stopped in mid-punch and sighed. <em>Looks like this hasn’t helped any. Excessive thinking is going to kill me, at this rate. </em>Kaname  decided to take a shower. Then she would dry herself off, and then she  would go to bed. In the morning, she could do things. Right now, she  just wanted to stop these lonely thoughts that were piling up, one on  top of the other. At this rate she’d bash herself into unconsciousness  just to gain some precious respite.</span></p>

“Are you done in there? Come on out.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it okay?” Momomi asked nervously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  both girls here,” Shion said, lying back on her bed. She appeared to  consider this sentence for a moment. “Okay, I appreciate that doesn’t  mean anything in this school. But don’t worry, the evil upperclassman  won’t molest you. If she was going to molest anyone, it would be  someone with a cuter personality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez,” Momomi said, walking  out of the bathroom and crawling under the covers of her bed. “I don’t  want to hear things like that from a stalker.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t a stalker in the best position to comment about comparative points like that?” Shion asked, kicking her legs lazily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you,” Momomi mumbled, ignoring this. “Do you like girls, the same as the Etoiles and so on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my,” Shion said, eyes amused. “Kiyashiki-chan is so forwards. Are you that interested in me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just curious,” Momomi said. “Though I assume that reply means yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  necessarily,” Shion said. “Actually, I don’t intend to give you a  straight answer. I prefer leaving you to wonder. I like being the one  who knows things about others, after all. But I’m not disgusted by  either option, that much I will say, unlike my parents who would  probably commit seppuku before recognising a lesbian relationship.  Well, my father, anyway. My mother would just wring her hands a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hate people like that, who are so selfish and troublesome,” Momomi  muttered. “They pass judgement on others because it pleases their sense  of tradition and try to control them, or failing that, turn them away  in any way they can. My father’s just the same. Which is hypocritical  of a serial adulterer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone needs someone to look down on,” Shion said simply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that. But to look down on something as simple as someone’s  sexuality, it’s way too stupid. It’s like hating the poor for being  poor. It isn’t something that can be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion closed her eyes, smiling. “Is that the voice of experience, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you mean?” Momomi shifted uncomfortably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You asked me about my sexual orientation, right? Isn’t it fair that I get to at least pose the question in return?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t answer,” Momomi said evasively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have to answer either,” Shion said. “I’m just asking, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… call me a traditionalist, but I don’t like talking about that sort of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion laughed softly. “Kiyashiki-san, you raised the subject. That excuse won’t cut it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi found herself blushing, which was an irrational reaction. <em>Why  am I remembering all those weird thoughts I had back then? It’s one  thing to imagine things in that abstract, but when you start thinking  about real people in that way without a good reason… but I had a good  reason, damnit! With a set-up like that, it could easily have been  something so weird! But isn’t the issue the fact that even now I’m not  sure what my reply would be? That certainly has to be called the weird  thing here…goddamnit, why did I even raise this? It’s too stupid, it’s  not like I care whether Shion’s gay or not. It has to be something in  the air, or the environment, it makes you ask things like that and  think things like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess you aren’t quite ready to be  confident about these things, Kiyashiki-san,” Shion said. “But that’s  fine. Take your time and believe in yourself, and everything else will  follow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I take it you have everything worked out,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know who I am, and I’m not ashamed,” Shion said. “But it’s something so  divorced from my daily life that it’s just an unnecessary complication.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like it when you talk like that.” Momomi gazed at her senpai with steady eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  say the outsider sees most of the game, but isn’t it more fun to be  playing? It’s just timid to always stay at the fringes of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re just the same, Kiyashiki-san,” Shion said. “I’m sure I said that before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well, if thinks work out the way I want them to, I’ll change all that,”  Momomi said. “So how about a bet? If I’m still here in my third year,  you’ll try in your fourth. Ho w about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tempting, but I don’t think so. I like being the way I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why? Isn’t it just being timid?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wrong. I’m not exactly the most social type of person, by my own admission, but I don’t lack confidence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  most interesting person in the world has been and gone,” Shion  explained. “After that, it begins to feel a little pointless, I can  assure you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s the case, then you should try and get her back! Anything’s better than just lazing around!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my,” Shion said. “You’re being a bit hypocritical, you know. Doesn’t change the bet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi bit her lip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll try, if you do.” Shion closed her eyes. “My interesting person for your interesting person. Isae for Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s hardly fair,” Momomi began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I suggest you stop talking,” Shion said, uncharacteristically sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just looked at her senpai for a while. “Did you… love her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you implying that you love Kenjou-san?” Shion asked, raising her  eyebrows. “Not that I’d be too surprised, after your flirting, but  realisation is a fine thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not,” Momomi replied. “Don’t be ridiculous. But all the same, the way you talk about her… Isae, that is, not Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know, because I was never given the time to know,” Shion said.  “Certainly it’s a question that has tormented me ever since she left. I  don’t suppose I’ll ever be able to find out now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi was silent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See  how pathetic it sounds, that way of speaking?” Shion sighed. “But you  should remember it, Kiyashiki-san. If you’re not careful, you could end  up saying such things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I really am taken from this school,” Momomi agreed glumly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  if you and Kaname don’t patch things up,” Shion said sharply. “She’s  within arm’s reach, Kiyashiki. I won’t forgive you if you make the same  mistakes as me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, I know. After all, when I really think about it, I do know what I have to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At the end of the day, most people do, but nothing changes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m different,” Momomi said. “I’ll show you that. And after that, I’ll  be waiting on you to match me. I think you want me to do that, because  it’s you as much as me who lacks the will to do what you want to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  make everything sound so simple, Kiyashiki-san,” Shion said, smiling  thinly. “Everything you do. It’s an impressive talent, I suggest you  keep it up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Whatever that means.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the same as  the Etoiles. Everyone needs to see a dream, a dream they can believe  in. But only a few gifted people can create them. That’s what I’ve come  to believe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You shouldn’t say such embarrassing things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The outsider sees most of the game, Kiyashiki-san.” Shion tapped her nose playfully. “You’d do well to remember that.”</span></p>
