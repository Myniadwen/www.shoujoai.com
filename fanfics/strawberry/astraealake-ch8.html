<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I'd like to pre-emptively assure my readers that I have a healthy respect for the Christian faith. But the thing is, Kaname <em>doesn't</em>.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On  that note. Considering Astraea's so religious, there should be nuns and  priests. Every Sunday, Kaname, Momomi, Shizuma and indeed any character  with confidence and a sense of humour should come to them and confess  to the number of times they'd had lesbian sex that week. Perhaps the  priests could have a fairly benevolent attitude, because fighting  lesbianism in Astraea is like fighting the fundamental nature of man  elsewhere. But I don't own Strawberry Panic, so the religion taught at  Astraea may forever be an entertaining mystery.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we’ve discussed things,” Kariya said, glaring at them all. “My main comment would be that you’re all damned cheeky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which  is to say that we appreciate your youthful high spirits, but ask that  you moderate your behaviour in future.” Serané smiled. “Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  I was referring to the pathological lying. I know when I’m being told a  story. I’m surprised they didn’t say ‘once upon a time’…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya, please,” Serané said, feigning shock. “How can we doubt the individually determined words of these honest students?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  get it, I get it.” Kariya raised her hands. “All trials are fair, all  soldiers are patriots and all students in trouble are truthful. The  kinds of things we say we believe to make society function…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think that follows,” Shion murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t expect someone like you to follow me,” Kariya said. “I’m not even  sure why you’re here. Just sit in the corner and rehearse your gossip  or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya,” Serané said. “Isn’t it a wonderful thing that Tomori-san has given up her own time to help us clear up this matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it would be if she’d told the truth-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case,” the Superior coughed pointedly. “We have come to a decision  on your punishment. You will all be confined to the school grounds for  a month.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Apart from Tomori-san,” Serané added.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Apart from Tomori-san, of course,” the Superior echoed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried hard not to laugh out loud. Once again, they were being punished by methods that weren’t punishment at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And for a month, you all have to clean the church every day, together,” Kariya said flatly. “Including the clock tower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly,” the Superior confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Apart from Tomori-san,” Serané clarified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Apart from Tomori-san,” the other two chorused, looking slightly annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  and Olesa managed to take this news onboard without reacting in an  extravagant manner. Kaname and Akimi, on the other hand, were a lot  louder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The whole thing, including the clock tower, every day?” Akimi said, sounding disbelieving. “Is that even physically possible?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn’t fair,” Kaname said. “This is you, again, isn’t it, Kariya? You sadistic-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi kicked her on the shin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I mean, Kariya-Etoile-sama, who came up with this,” Kaname said. “Because she’s good with ideas for punishments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  way more than you deserve. If it was up to me, I’d have you doing that  for the rest of the year. But I was persuaded to moderate that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not for the first time or even the fiftieth, the younger girls collectively thanked God for Serané’s gentle influence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, none of you are in a position to negotiate,” Kariya said. “  Make no mistake, your behaviour is utterly inexecusable. Astraea is a  school of religiosity, peace, co-operation, multiculturalism, student  freedoms, bunnies and other fluffy things. If any of you ever act in  this way again, you will be thrown out, no questions asked, regardless  of how much money you pay us. And that will be secondary to my own  personal punishments for you all. This is not a common, mandatory  school. You are all, in different ways, priviliged to be here. Mock  that privilige and you will lose it. Is that understood?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Etoile-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should think so, too,” Kariya said. “Useless, ungrateful brats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya…”  Serané cocked her head, smiling sweetly. “Shouldn’t you be a little  kinder? I’m sure they’re sufficiently chastened and gratified for your  mercy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should think so, too,” Kariya said, mollified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case,” the Superior repeated, sounding like she was well used to  the process, “there will be a Sister to oversee your work, so you are  to fulfil it competently and for duration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané leaned back,  closing her eyes thoughtfully. “There’s no need to go so far. We can  oversee this, along with some of the sixth years.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is a matter of school discipline, Etoile,” the Superior said. “We can deal with it perfectly well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, but I’d hate to trouble the Sisters over something so trivial.  All that matters is that they attend and perform to a satisfactory  level, yes? It would be time-consuming for a Sister, but we can deal  with it very easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.” Kariya sounded a little confused  but equally determined. “We can handle it. It’s just a case of smacking  their heads until they’re working properly, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so,  they are not to slack off after a few weeks,” the Superior said. “Or  their caretakers, for that matter. This is to be taken seriously.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We will personally take full responsibility. I guarentee it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We will? I mean, we will,” Kariya completed. “Leave it to us, Superior. I won’t let them waste a minute, I can assure you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Superior sighed. “Very well. I don’t know why you’re so emphatic, but I won’t fight it. Look after it, Serané, Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Superior.” Kariya bowed her head. “We’ll take care of it. That’s all, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One thing,” Momomi said, raising a hand tentatively. “Can I make a phone call?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you still doing here?” Kaname asked, closing her eyes moodily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, why not?” Amiki retorted. “We don’t trust you two, not by a long way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about Olesa? Cat got her tongue?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re noisy for a brute,” Olesa replied, almost philosophically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bridled. “You bastard-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki coughed pointedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  restrained herself, leaning against the wall of the corridor again. “In  any case, you don’t need to be here. This is just Momomi working to  deal with Momomi’s problem. You guys don’t have to stalk her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki smirked. “How about you? Can’t leave your girlfriend alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be idiotic.” Kaname stretched in a pointedly relaxed, disdainful  fashion. “I don’t want to be here. But this part’s my idea, it’s  necessary to oversee it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re dodging the question.” Amiki  leaned forwards slightly, staring thoughtfully. “Why are you doing her  planning? Heck, why is she letting you of all people come up with  ideas? Aren’t you Kaname the loner? The way you guys are, I swear I’m  right when I say that you’re her boyfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be immature,”  Kaname said. “I’m not interested in a disgusting relationship like  that. Don’t compare me with the likes of Kariya and Serané, who are so  weird and twisted it’s hard to believe and harder to watch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  say that, but I think it’s all you do. Just something you say for a  snappy answer. How about Amane, then? Would you mind her noticing you  that way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be ridiculous,” Kaname said. “She’s just too  stupid and annoying and rich and introverted and weak and egotistical  and everything I hate. Even though she is a man, so it’s not like  that’s a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha,” Amiki said. “You’re as foul-mouthed as ever. And as decietful, considering you stalk her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you and Olesa?” Kaname said. “You two are even weirder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s my job to protect her. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What a romantic notion.” Kaname closed her eyes again. “Where did you learn to fight, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve had training. I’m living proof that there’s no need to be street trash like you to be able to fight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Arrogant. Do you want to finish this at some point, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine by me,” Amiki snapped. “I have a bunch of bruises all over that are going to be paid back with interest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Any time you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amiki,  you won’t fight,” Olesa ordered. “Kenjou-san, you will not fight if you  have any respect for Kiyashiki-san’s continual presence at this school.  Is that understood?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Amiki said, bowing her head. “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  don’t sound too much like Kariya.” Kaname rolled her eyes at the  thought. “I don’t take orders from you, girl. And I haven’t forgiven  you, either. One day I will definitely make you both pay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood,” Olesa said. “We aren’t finished with you, either. But it’s within our mutual interests to co-operate for now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll let that slide, purely because that’s what Momomi would say. But your excuses won’t work on me forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki just laughed. “That’s fine. Keep telling yourself that, if it helps you sleep at night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi came out, looking depressive. “I’m finished,” she said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What happened?” Kaname said, immediately averting her attention from the other two.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I apologised. I want you to thank me for that. It took a lot of effort. I still can’t believe I went through with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come over her,” Kaname said. “I’ll pat you on the head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nah, kiss her,” Akimi said. “I’m sure she’ll consider that worthwhile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop associating me with your strange imaginings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tush,” Momomi said. “I feel so loved. You guys are useless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright,  more seriously,” Kaname said. “I’m glad. You’d have been a bloody idiot  not to… but I know it’s not easy to overcome your pride.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just so long as you understand,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Especially for someone like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t need to add that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought I would, though. Anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  explained things and my father has said he’ll consider giving me a few  more weeks,” Momomi said. “But he didn’t make any promises. I just know  he’s going to hold that over me. He’s dead against coming out here, he  said he doesn’t have that kind of time to waste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  troublesome. We can’t really work on your family before then. There’s a  limit to the conspiracies that can be constructed by international rate  phone-lines.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, some things can’t be done.” Momomi sighed. “That’s just the way it is. Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  be seeing you two around.” Amiki waved sardonically as she walked away.  “A lot more than I’d like, by the sound of it, and starting this  afternoon. Don’t be late on us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise.” Kaname followed Momomi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like it,” she said, the moment they were out of earshot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t like corroborating with those two. They can’t be trusted at all  and they’re our natural opponents. I still want to finish them once and  for all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me too, believe me. I’m not enjoying this alliance.  Neither are they. But it’s exactly what you said. If we want to win  this, we’ll have to swallow our pride. That goes for you as well as me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. But I don’t have to like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just as long as you’re willing to sacrifice things alongside me,” Momomi said. “Otherwise we stand no chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that, already.” Kaname looked annoyed. “But there are limits. It’s  just far too cowardly and low to have to crawl to your enemies for  favours. And it’s truly a pain to be around them. I get annoyed just  talking to them. You may remember, I’m more than willing to put one  over your father, but even so. I didn’t like the idea of you  apologising to him, either, especially when I can’t remember the last  time you apologised to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, I know,” Momomi said. “Well, I’ve no intention of making a habit of it, so don’t get too excited.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, I think I’d be freaked out if you ever apologised. I just can’t imagine it. You’re really far too arrogant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Point established. You’re exactly the same, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yes,” Kaname admitted. “My pride, such as it is, is important. Though  you might think that I don’t have any pride, you’d be wrong, quite the  reverse. It’s pride and honour, not in a fight, but in how I deal with  people. Straight-forwardly. I hate your puppet-string stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pride  only matters when you respect the opinions of those around you,” Momomi  said. “I can make the distinction. But for you and me, we can count  those individuals on the fingers of one hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have more  than one person?” Kaname laughed sarcastically. “Consider yourself  lucky. I only have you, because I don’t show weaknesses to my enemies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about Amiki, then?” Momomi retorted. “Isn’t she an enemy too?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yep. But not one worthy of any respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m flattered. It seems I really am important to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As important as I am to you,” Kaname said. “So you can think about it. Don’t get any funny ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  ended up buying cheap lunch boxes at the canteen. Well, cheap was a  relative measure at Astraea Lake. Kaname remained glad that stuff was  free for her. After that, they walked through the forest, heading for  the elm. As expected, Shion was already waiting for them. “Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi briefly recounted what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good thinking, Kiyashiki-san,” Shion said. “That should buy you some breathing space.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, it was my idea, thank you very much.” Kaname looked annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t sound so surprised!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I never knew that Kenjou-san cared so much about Kiyashiki-san,” Shion  replied easily. “It doesn’t suit your reputation to expend effort  helping other people. But it’s true when people say that you two go  well together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>People say that? People need better things to talk about. </em>“Don’t  misunderstand,” Kaname said out loud. “This is to punish Momomi’s  father, that’s all. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What if she’s also the daughter of your enemy?” Shion asked. “And why is he your enemy anyway? Because of her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  he’s a rich, arrogant, annoying aristocrat who thinks he can just give  orders and do what he pleases. Isn’t it obvious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To you, perhaps. Sadly he’s not exactly unique in that respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, to draw that bastard into a false sense of security. That was  my intention. It’s what all the best generals have done throughout  history. An enemy who considers themselves invincible is one who’s  already half-way to losing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my,” Shion said. “We’ll make a thinker of you yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  can only think in aggressive terms, though,” Momomi said, sitting down  and balancing her lunch on her knees. “Well, I guess that’s to be  expected. Let’s talk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can guess. You want my help, because you have every intention of staying at this school. Am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Precisely.  You’ve got better information, better standing, and more experience  with this school than either of us. We can use that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And in return?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sat and opened her lunch box, allowing her mind to drift slightly. She’d always found negotiation painfully boring. <em>Isn’t  it better just to get on with things? I don’t even see the need for all  these useless people. Shion… what the hell use was is weird third-year?  Does Momomi collect them or something? It’s really annoying.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  can help you,” Momomi said. “You said it yourself, that we have  potential. Whatever weird things you want us to do, I’m sure we can  manage it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not exactly the most popular or social of individuals. It’s not like there aren’t plenty of other people to use.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,  but how many of them are willing to listen to a mere random third  year?” Momomi grinned. “Both our grades are top class. Kaname is second  best in our year at sports and can beat out many people older than her,  without effort. I’m an excellent speaker and actress; I can draw and  write as well. We’re talented people, whether we apply ourselves or  not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Umeboshi,” Kaname said, looking discontentedly at her rice. “I hate umeboshi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose I don’t have much choice. Very well. In return for my help, you help me with one of my events. How about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like them,” Momomi said. “Give it here. But what would that constitute, exactly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname picked up the small, sour fruit with her chopsticks and offered it to Momomi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  impolite to do that, you know,” Shion sniffed. “Passing food between  chopsticks. But saying what you’d have to do would be spoiling the  surprise, now wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is?” Kaname said. “News to me. Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what happens in funerals,” Momomi said. “And I’m getting suspicious now that you’re hiding something from me, Shion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  Can’t say I’ve ever been to one,” Kaname mused, trying to look  unconcerned. “I skipped my father’s, if he even had one… all these  stupid rules.” She offered her chopsticks to Momomi’s lips instead,  tapping her free hand impatiently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that even more impolite, or… I don’t know, I guess it’s only expected in the arena of flirting,” Shion said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  blushed. “Oh, for Christ’s sake, what do you want? I just don’t want to  have to eat the damn thing! Who needs your godamn social laws?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  hesitated for a moment, then leaned forwards and ate the fruit. “There,  done now.” She tried not to blush in turn. “Can we get on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Finally…” Kaname looked down, returning to her rice. “Manners only get in the way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion sighed. “All you had to do was pass your bento over, you know? If I didn’t know you two better-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  say it,” Kaname warned her. “I’m sick of it. What’s with this place?  It’s like the rules are reversed and 95 of people are expected to be  lesbians, not the other way round. It makes no sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that figure almost holds up around here, if I can trust my sources,”  Shion replied. “Make of that what you will. How about you, Kenjou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not answering that on principle. It’s too ridiculous to even discuss.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wonder… But to try and return to the topic at hand. I don’t specify the  details because I don’t know myself what the next big chance will be.  But I’ll admit it would be useful to have you two at my disposal.  Almost as good as Otori-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname almost choked on her rice. “So we’re just replacements for that bitch Amane now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  of course not,” Shion said hurriedly. “Truthfully, I’ve all but given  up on Amane. She’s wonderful at what she does, but that’s it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly,”  Kaname snapped. “Amane has no room for anyone in her life but herself.  Remember that before you make stupid comparisons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you two are pretty narrow-minded as well. If you don’t mind me saying so, that is. But I suppose you have each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still suggesting-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not suggesting anything about romantic relationships, Kenjou-san,”  Shion said. “I’m referring to platonic friendship. I might add that the  only one acting strangely, flirting with food and jumping at the mere  suggestion of the subject is you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, don’t blame me. It’s  that bitch Amiki, making her stupid comparisons all the damn time. What  does she know about anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Looks like Kaname cares a little more about Amiki’s opinion than she likes to admit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  do not! But there are some things that shouldn’t be open to  misinterpretation. We aren’t even friends; we’re just allies of  convenience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pretty much,” Momomi sighed. “Kaname’s always  reminding me that we’ll go back to fighting after we’ve guaranteed my  presence here by any means necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think I understand,”  Shion said, resting her forehead on her hand. “Though you’re making my  head ache. Right. I won’t mistake you going everywhere together, doing  everything together, standing up for each other and working together on  an important and difficult common goal for friendship any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That sounded like sarcasm,” Kaname noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “Alright, that’s enough playing around, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t sound like that,” Kaname said seriously. “It’s way too girlish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s in comparison to you, who’s about as manly as a girl can get,”  Shion noted. “I can accept that, but I shudder to think of  Kiyashiki-san catering to your comfort zones.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not that manly. This is another one of your exaggerations. I just have short hair because it’s convenient. That’s it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s your handsome features.” Momomi grinned. “You can’t help it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s what I call a backhanded compliment,” Shion said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, Momomi doesn’t look like a guy. But I distinguish between a  pretty girl and an airhead like… what’s that weird girl in Lulim?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which one?” Momomi said. “I didn’t know <em>normal </em>girls attended Lulim.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion rolled her eyes. “Very droll. But Momomi’s a pretty girl now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not afraid to say that much. She’s that much, as distinct from you, who’s plain, bossy and with a wide forehead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t want to hear that from a girl whose idea of dignified behaviour  is trying to drop-kick a schoolmate while screaming at the top of her  lungs.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what would you do in that situation?” Kaname said scornfully. “Talk the enemy to death? I can protect what I need to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like Momomi, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, girls, please,” Momomi said. “You were both useful yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like Momomi, perhaps,” Kaname retorted. “Again, as opposed to you. Of course, no one’s actually bothered to bully you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  because I’m smart enough to keep myself out of trouble. Unlike you, who  knows nothing but trouble and needs me to bail you out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, really,” Momomi said. “I appreciate it, but there’s no need to fight over me. I love you both, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As she’d expected, that stopped the argument cold.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re two minutes late,” Olesa noted impassively, after lessons that day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  forgive us,” Kaname said. “I’m sure that’ll make a staggering  difference. You could have brought out the mops while we were waiting,  you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And have you make a habit of this?” Amiki chimed in.  “Forget it. The work we’re doing, we’re doing together, and split  between us. All of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, you two aren’t the ones trying to cope with a major crisis here,” Kaname pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You think I care?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi ran a casual hand through her hair. “We have ways of making you care.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it doesn’t apply to this. We’ll do this fairly, or not at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We get it, we get,” Kaname said. “But, you know, we’re wasting time standing her and debating all that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know, already!” They went to the Church’s small cupboard, retrieving everything they’d need and walking back out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, who’s doing what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll do the Church itself.” Momomi struggled with her bucket and mop. “You guys take the clock tower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  impossible,” Olesa said. “However you look at it, the clock tower is  far more work. Especially the stairs. I expect a fair division.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you kidding? I’m being saintly here. The Church itself is far larger. And the seats aren’t exactly helpful, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shall  we swap, then?” Amiki asked. “You enjoy staggering up and down that  staircase with buckets of water in each hand. It’s a short walk to the  tap from the Church’s floor, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what do you suggest, then?” Momomi huffed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  work on the Church floor, you the clock tower floor,” Olesa said.  “Amiki on the windows. Kenjou-san can keep us supplied with clean water  and the walls in the spare time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, that’s fair.” Kaname  scowled. “I do all the heavy lifting, Momomi gets what’s in your own  words the harder of the two duties, Amiki only has to do the windows?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Windows  are difficult, you know,” Amiki said. “You have to be very careful with  the stained glass. It’s not like the walls, where you just wet it and  that’s that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides, isn’t that overcomplicated?” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, fine. Amiki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll take the exterior. You two take the interior. How about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drop  dead,” Kaname said. “Right, my turn. I have a good one. We all do  everything together one thing at a time without any division of labour.  Is that fine with everyone, already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That was fine with  everyone, already. They dumped their equipment in the corner of the  Church and staggered outside, holding buckets in both hands. Momomi  gritted her teeth, feeling the metal handles cut into her delicate  skin. She wasn’t cut out for this. “What happened to your sidekicks,  anyway? They weren’t at the showdown with the Etoiles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’ve received a separate, less arduous punishment,” Amiki said. “We cut them loose. There’s no point in pressing the issue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why the hell did you do that?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we didn’t know Kariya would set such extravagantly difficult and  exhaustive physical labour as our punishment,” Amiki said defensively.  “If it was just isolation or something, the fewer the better. This  way’s less convenient, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be too surprised. She’s  inventive and sadistic. I swear blind she’s come up with punishments  this school has never seen before, stuff beyond even the Sisters.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname isn’t too fond of Kariya-sama,” Momomi explained, her lips quirking into a smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can tell,” Amiki said, starting to fill her buckets. “Well, I guess it’s because they’re so alike.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am nothing like that psychotic lesbian dingbat. Remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  the main distinction is that Kariya’s better behaved and has a  responsible personality,” Momomi quipped. “It is a difference, Kaname,  don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you start,” the blue haired girl said. “As  for you, the differences between Serané and your august self are too  profound to chart. As distant as America after tectonic drift until  that continent’s a long way away from us and global warming has brought  sea levels to our knees as we stand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes. As far I’m concerned, that’s a good thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think Kenjou-san was referring to her beauty, grace, mellow personality  and saintly patience and interest in others,” Olesa said. “Am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“First time I’ve agreed with you, ever. But at least we’re comparable to the Etoiles. That’s more than you two are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m glad to see you’re all getting on so well,” Shion said, walking  towards them. “You’re talking, which is more than I’d expected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  talking to trade insults.” Kaname pushed past Amiki and began to fill  her own buckets. “That’s hardly the best example of friendly  communication.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, but you don’t ever do anything but trade insults, Kenjou-san,” Shion said. “Even with your best friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which one? I wasn’t aware I had a friend, as I’ve illustrated for you before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, say girlfriend, then,” Shion said. “You were flirting at lunch, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Amiki said. “I knew it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God  damnit,” Kaname said. “I don’t care who you think you or the fact that  you’re a senpai, I’m going to break your nose in three places!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  safe as long as you’re holding the buckets,” Amiki observed. “But  you’re way too defensive, Kaname. Methinks the lady doth protest too  much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing here, anyway?” Momomi said. “Grab a bucket and mop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think so,” Shion replied, sitting on the verge of the grass and  watching them idly. She flicked her fingers delicately through her  hair. “I’d rather watch you all struggle, and provide you with  encouragement and advice when you need it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wonderful,” Kaname said. “A backseat cleaner. Can such a thing even exist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I don’t know that much about cleaning,” Shion confessed. “I’ve never  had to do anything like that. So I’ll just present you with generic  advice, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is ridiculous,” Kaname said, deciding to  pretend that the third-year didn’t exist. She stepped back, letting  Olesa take her place at the tap. Water sloshed in the buckets, but she  managed to step back a decent distance without spilling any and put  them down. “Child labour, I’m telling you. Does this school even employ  cleaners?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not sure,” Momomi replied. “I don’t think so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you know, I’m reminded of Jesus,” Kaname said. “Didn’t he have to go  into a desert for forty days and forty nights or something? He’d have  had to carry water in buckets, they didn’t have plastic in those days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure it was forty days?” Momomi asked. “Wasn’t that the flood?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know. If it was the flood, there wouldn’t have been a water  problem, anyway. Unless it was salt water. But I never got the whole  two-by-two thing anyway. You try and get two elephants in front of two  mice and behind two antelopes followed by two tigers to form an orderly  queue. And what did they eat? They’d have needed a bunch of other  animals to feed the meat eaters, or at least dead and prepared. Would  you be comfortable in a boat with the dead flesh of your erstwhile  comrades?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m more worried by the fact that you’re comparing  yourself to the Messiah.” Olesa turned off the tap and stepped back.  She struggled visibly with the weight, but gritted her teeth and  struggled on before resting the buckets on the ground next to the  others.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it follows, doesn’t it? The desert was a whole  teenage rebellion thing, you know, temptation and all that crap. The  Devil said this and that, you know, premarital sex, drugs, binge  drinking, mmos, all that stuff… but Jesus was a daddy’s boy and told  him to screw off. And then he left the desert again. What a boring guy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He did die for your sins, you know,” Amiki offered. “Just pointing that out, if your little heathen brain can process it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s another thing I don’t get. He sacrificed himself for our sins.  But I mean, again, it’s just because daddy says so and he doesn’t do  anything to save himself even though he really could have done so,  because of daddy. I mean, how lame is that? I’m sorry, I loosely  understand the concept of filial obedience but if my father’s standing  by while I’m having nails driven through my palms… there are limits.  Besides, he’s fricking Jesus. Why didn’t he just save himself and  everyone else at the same time? He’s the Son of God, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  rolled her eyes. “Well, he kinda did, you idiot. If I can be allowed to  sink to your inane level. He came back from the dead, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  was that even necessary, though? A sacrifice? Yeah, right. He’s Jesus,  he should be able to save everyone instantly. If a sacrifice is needed,  then it’s meaningless because he gets up again a few days later. What  kind of sacrifice is that? If it’s not about the sacrifice, the whole  thing was pointless. Besides, why did God enjoy his son bleeding to  death anyway? What kind of weird-ass redemption for mankind is that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  have an excessively, even charmingly simplistic and naïve view of our  faith,” Olesa noted quietly. “It would be endearing if it wasn’t so  obnoxiously idiotic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right,” Kaname replied. “Whatever.  I’m just telling it how it is. A prophet’s never loved in his own  country or something, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That might be the case…” Momomi conceeded indulgantly. “But you’re not a prophet. You’re just an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What she said,” Amiki nodded. “Wait, I just agreed with Momomi. This is too fricking weird, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  say all that, but you don’t argue with me,” Kaname said. “Come on, tell  me what makes Jesus so great anyway? Bleeding to death on a cross  hardly requires training, now does it? Well…” Her voice tailed off when  she noticed that the others had gone white.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shall I explain to you, Kenjou-san?” a voice asked imperiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh, no need…” Kaname said, turning around slowly and facing Sister Kawakami. “I thought you weren’t overseeing this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?” the head of Spica said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well…  yes.” Sensing that this was insufficient, she added. “I was joking.  Joking! I know how great he is really, don’t worry… I just thought I’d  lighten the tone! But I love him and God really, and they’re  omnibenevolent so I’ll be sure to pray for forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Sister’s lips pursed. “Well, if that’s the case, I’m sure you want mind coming to my office and talking about your faith.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of… course not.” Kaname’s shoulders slumped. “No problem at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  others watched as she was frog-marched off. “Well, that was  interesting,” Amiki said. “I consider myself fairly religious, but I  can’t say I envy her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,” Momomi said vaguely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?  You wouldn’t mind being in there, talking about that stuff? You never  struck me as the religious type. You behave too badly for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not it,” Momomi replied, ignoring Amiki’s hypocricy. “It just occurs to me that we’ve been left here with the buckets.”</span></p>
