<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;And she didn&#39;t say anything else?&quot; Shizuma asked, her tone taking an 
agitated edge.

Tamao shook her head, sensing the former-Etoile&#39;s anger, not wanting to 
enrage it further than she already felt she had, despite knowing full 
well she hadn&#39;t actually done anything wrong herself.

Shizuma sighed, shaking her head and pacing the length of the room, 
staring out across the school grounds through the wide bedroom window. 
How uncharacteristically childish, she thought. Miyuki really was 
scraping the bottom of the barrel now.

Nagisa sat on her bed behind, a flushed look of guilt on her face as she 
regarded her roommate sat opposite. She bowed her head, fiddling with 
her uniform in her lap as she said in a meek voice,

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to get Tamao-chan in trouble.&quot;

Tamao looked across at Nagisa, unsure of how to respond. As much as 
she&#39;d wanted to help her friend, she wasn&#39;t eager to get into trouble 
with the school just so the couple could sleep together either. It 
hadn&#39;t left her feeling the best as it was, although she knew it was 
likely beneficial for her in the long run.

With a sigh, Shizuma repeated the sentiment,

&quot;Indeed, that was never the idea,&quot; looking back across her shoulder at 
Tamao, she added, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry Tamao, I didn&#39;t mean to snap. I 
shouldn&#39;t be taking it out on you.&quot;

She returned her gaze to the window,

&quot;I&#39;ll get my things together this morning and go back to my room; it 
just means I&#39;ll have to confront Miyuki sooner than I&#39;d hoped.&quot;

Nagisa looked up from her lap, offering,

&quot;Can I help Shizuma-sama?&quot;

Nodding, Shizuma replied,

&quot;Please, if I get my things together, can you help me carry them back?&quot;

Nagisa nodded before standing to help gather up the former-Etoile&#39;s 
clothes. She looked downcast, unhappy to see their cosy existence 
disturbed, especially after such a wonderful weekend.

Inwardly, Tamao was relieved by their decision. Trying to lighten the 
atmosphere, she asked,

&quot;How did the stay go anyway, was it nice?&quot;

Nagisa giggled, looking towards Shizuma who&#39;d disappeared into the 
bathroom to collect her toiletries,

&quot;Shizuma has strange taste in music,&quot; then giggling again she added, 
&quot;and Amane-sama can&#39;t dance to save her life!&quot;

With a wry smile on her lips, Shizuma reappeared from the bathroom door 
way.

&quot;And Nagisa is a light weight, but that&#39;s another story,&quot; winking at 
Tamao as she casually chucked her wash bag onto the bed.

She sighed, adjusting her hair clip, before reaching into one of the 
shopping bags she&#39;d left beside Nagisa&#39;s bed when they&#39;d returned a 
little earlier. Having retrieved what she was after, she turned to face 
Tamao.

&quot;This was side tracked in the hassle with Miyuki, I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s 
something from Nagisa and I to say thank you to Tamao-chan for being so 
understanding.&quot;

Tamao blanched, looking up at Shizuma as she offered her a neatly 
wrapped parcel with an elaborate bow tied around it. Blushing slightly, 
she stumbled over her words as she accepted the gift, not sure of what 
to say.

&quot;Uh, thank you Shizuma-sama,&quot; adding as she glanced at her room mate, 
&quot;thank you Nagisa-chan.&quot;

Nagisa smiled, watching the dark haired fourth year turn the parcel over 
in her hand.

&quot;Does Tamao-chan have special eyes that see through paper?&quot; she teased.

Taking the hint, Tamao carefully undid the black bow, tugging at the 
shiny red wrapping paper underneath until she held a soft brown case in 
her hand.

Cracking it open gently, she looked inside the velvet interior, a 
delicate bracelet resting inside, the solid silver shimmering in the 
bright day light. She brushed it carefully with her finger, the 
heart-shaped locket suspended on the bracelet chain turning onto its 
side, revealing an inscription running across the rim. Quietly, she read 
the lettering to herself,

&quot;To the best friend anyone could wish for - Aoi-san &amp; Hanazono-san.&quot;

Looking up at the two girls watching her, Tamao&#39;s face flushed and her 
eyes rimmed with tears. She bowed her gaze again quickly as she brushed 
them away, rocking her head whilst trying to avoid looking silly. She 
hadn&#39;t expected anything like this, especially from Shizuma as well.

Nagisa sat beside her, a fond look on her face. She put her arms round 
the fourth year, holding her dearly.

&quot;Thank you Tamao-chan.&quot;

Shizuma smiled warmly, adding,

&quot;I really appreciated you doing what you have Tamao. I know things have 
been hard for you like this; you really are the best friend Nagisa could 
wish for.&quot;

Then with an after thought,

&quot;And perhaps if you&#39;ll have me, a good friend to an old hag too.&quot;

Tamao looked up at the silver haired upperclassman, tears running down 
her cheeks.

&quot;Shizuma-sama...&quot; she mumbled, and stood before giving the former-Etoile 
an awkward hug. Kissing Tamao on the forehead, Shizuma smiled, before 
holding the girl at arms length so she could look her in the eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve caused you any harm Tamao, it was never my 
intention.&quot;

Tamao shook her head again, the tears bubbling over, before the three 
girls collapsed together in a messy hug, standing silent in the centre 
of the room.

- - - - -

Turning the corner to the sixth year corridor, Shizuma sighed as she 
looked down the hall towards her door. Squeezing Nagisa&#39;s hand, she 
whispered,

&quot;Whatever happens, just ignore her and let me do the talking. The last 
thing you need now is to get into trouble and she&#39;s obviously happy to 
throw her weight around.&quot;

She briefly pondered the type of woman her friend of so many years had 
become, shaking her head before setting off down the corridor. It was a 
marked contrast to the self-sacrificing fourth year she&#39;d left in 
Nagisa&#39;s room a floor below. Or was it, she caught herself wondering. 
Perhaps it&#39;s just a case of limits; Miyuki obviously having reached hers 
after the election ceremony.

As they reached her door, Shizuma drew her keys from her bag, twisting 
the lock open before ushering Nagisa into her room quietly.

Just as she did, Miyuki&#39;s door cracked open, the dark-haired sixth year 
poking her head around the corner.

&quot;Shizuma?&quot;

The school council President was still in her night clothes, and her 
brown eyes narrowed as she took in the red head standing next to 
Shizuma.

&quot;Oh, you brought company,&quot; she muttered, &quot;what a shame,&quot; before 
disappearing from the doorway but leaving the door ajar nonetheless.

Taking the hint, Shizuma nodded to Nagisa, indicating for her to wait in 
Shizuma&#39;s room. The fourth year nodded back, taking Shizuma&#39;s bags from 
her before plopping them on the former-Etoile&#39;s bed and heading into the 
bathroom to get some water for tea.

Taking a deep breath, Shizuma stepped into Miyuki&#39;s room, carefully 
pushing the door to behind her.

Miyuki was sat in bed, still in her pastel blue night shirt and pyjama 
bottoms, holding the book she&#39;d been reading on her lap. She looked at 
Shizuma with moody eyes, waiting for the former-Etoile to start, hoping 
the awkward silence would work in her favour. In her experience as 
council President, a guilty conscience under interrogation would always 
try to fill the long pauses with excuses.

Shizuma looked at her former roommate, standing uncomfortably at the 
other end of the bed. After a moment she gave in, beginning the 
proceedings,

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to threaten Suzumi-chan, she&#39;s not done anything 
wrong.&quot;

Miyuki raised a dark brow,

&quot;Its chan now is it?&quot; then adding with a flat tone, &quot;and yes, she&#39;s done 
something very wrong as you well know. I was just performing my duty as 
school council President, making sure she was aware of her error.&quot;

Shizuma sighed,

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be like that Miyuki; she was just trying to help us 
out.&quot;

Miyuki laughed, bemused by the response,

&quot;It&#39;s strange seeing you act so defensive of the girl. It wasn&#39;t long 
ago you were sparring with her for Nagisa&#39;s affection.&quot;

Shizuma pride flared,

&quot;It was hardly sparring. Besides, it wasn&#39;t just Nagisa and I she was 
trying to help. You should be thanking her too.&quot;

Miyuki looked at Shizuma with cynical eyes,

&quot;Oh, and how is that?&quot;

&quot;She was trying to get you some space Miyuki, that&#39;s why,&quot; Shizuma 
snapped. &quot;The last thing the pair of us needed was to be back on top of 
each other again so soon after the election.&quot;

Miyuki leered,

&quot;I&#39;ll decide at what point I happen to fancy being on top of you thank 
you.&quot;

Shizuma blanched, shaking her head in disbelief.

&quot;That&#39;s not you talking Miyuki.&quot;

The raven haired sixth year sneered,

&quot;Perhaps... But how would you know what is, and what isn&#39;t me, exactly?&quot; 
She scowled, looking Shizuma straight in the eye. &quot;You spend all your 
time wrapped up in your latest distractions, how is it you think you 
know me at all?&quot;

Shizuma bowed her head.

&quot;I never forgot you were there Miyuki.&quot;

The school council President sat forward in the bed and snapped,

&quot;No you didn&#39;t did you, which makes it all the worse! You knew exactly 
how I felt and you carried on all the same, more than happy to brush my 
feelings aside as long as I was still there for yours when you needed me 
again afterwards.&quot;

Shizuma looked up again,

&quot;It wasn&#39;t like that. You weren&#39;t brushed aside for them; I just never 
looked at you in that way, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Shizuma was lying and she knew it, conscious of the thin walls and 
Nagisa being next door. Seeing the opportunity, Miyuki slid out of the 
bed and walked toward Shizuma with a level gaze.

&quot;No? What about the morning in your room before you gave the Etoile 
necklaces back? The morning you forced me to kiss you... Or the morning 
of the election, when you called for me to you to comb your hair? What 
were you thinking of then Shizuma?&quot; She undid the top buttons of her 
night shirt, pulling the collar back to expose her bare shoulders. &quot;Is 
this enough, or was it more?&quot;

Shizuma felt her face flush with anger, her personal space disturbed by 
Miyuki&#39;s increasing proximity and the enjoyment she was obviously 
getting from berating Shizuma&#39;s behaviour within ear shot of Nagisa. She 
snapped back in frustration,

&quot;I was confused, and lonely. You were so busy sticking your oar into my 
relationship with Nagisa that I didn&#39;t know what I felt!&quot;

Miyuki capitalised, yelling back,

&quot;Do you ever? You just leech onto the nearest thing you can, whether 
it&#39;s strong and supportive or shallow and despera - &quot;

Miyuki stopped, realising what she was about to imply, knowing in her 
eagerness to turn the knife she&#39;d overstepped the mark. Sheer anger 
seethed in Shizuma&#39;s emerald eyes, and she said in a grating voice,

&quot;Finish your sentence Miyuki.&quot;

Well aware that she&#39;d have to follow through or lose face to the 
former-Etoile, Miyuki tried hard to hold Shizuma&#39;s gaze. She was 
unwilling to be forced back into the weak, submissive roll of the girl 
that used to promise Shizuma she&#39;d try harder; the girl Shizuma used to 
cradle at night to stop her room mate&#39;s homesick tears, and the sixth 
year bit her lip before resigning herself to finishing the train of 
thought. Lacking any real conviction however, she added,

&quot;Well she was dying wasn&#39;t she; she had to be pretty desperate.&quot;

That was enough for Shizuma, and her eyes glazed over as she brought the 
back of her hand hard across Miyuki&#39;s face, flooring the sixth year in a 
single blow. Stepping forward, raising her hand to deliver a second, 
Shizuma snarled,

&quot;Look at what you&#39;ve become Miyuki, it&#39;s pathetic!&quot;

But the blow was blocked, Nagisa&#39;s hand grabbing Shizuma&#39;s wrist before 
she could complete the swing.

The former-Etoile struggled briefly for a moment, shaking off Nagisa&#39;s 
grip before dropping her hand in annoyance, glaring back at the fourth 
year behind her. Her girlfriend&#39;s soft brown eyes returned the stare, 
filled with concern. Shizuma&#39;s demeanour softened immediately and she 
shook her head in dismay,

&quot;No, you&#39;re right Nagisa. This won&#39;t achieve anything.&quot;

Regret and sorrow washing over her, the silver haired Miatorian looked 
back at the dark haired girl lying in a heap on the floor.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how I did this to you Miyuki, but I never intended to hurt 
you.&quot;

She sighed gently, continuing,

&quot;You were always my best friend; the one person I knew was looking out 
for me. The one person I would look out for too. I hate what we&#39;ve 
become; Kaori would hate what we&#39;ve become.&quot;

Turning, she led Nagisa by the hand, closing the door behind her.

- - - - -

The tiny form of Chiyo Tsukidate trudged her way up the hill towards the 
Dormitory building, having spent the better part of the morning 
wandering the school grounds aimlessly, trying to prepare herself for 
facing her onee-sama as she reported for room temp duty.

She&#39;d walked as far as Lulim, her mind turning over the previous day&#39;s 
events. Feeling no better, she&#39;d gone on to Miator; she&#39;d even continued 
to Spica and completed the full loop of the Astrea grounds. Despite even 
that, the journey had been fruitless, the little first year none the 
wiser as to how she&#39;d explain away the elaborate mess with the two 
school council Presidents, or the fact that she&#39;d broken Nagisa-sama&#39;s 
confidence, despite having promised not to.

She kicked a stone on the path beneath her, feeling totally down trodden 
and petrified to face her fourth year mentors, scared they&#39;d be angry 
with her or worse still, tell her they no longer wanted her as room temp 
and deny her contact with her onee-sama altogether.

It was all Shizuma&#39;s fault. If she hadn&#39;t stolen the heart of her 
onee-sama and enraged President Rokujo by ruining Miator&#39;s election 
chances, then none of this would have happened and she wouldn&#39;t be 
wandering around aimlessly, looking for complicated explanations she 
couldn&#39;t string together in her head.

All Shizuma&#39;s fault.

That, and Kagome and her dammed teddy bear. What was it with that 
annoying Lulim girl anyway? Why did Chiyo feel so compelled to divulge 
everything when she was around her; that eerie gaze and the stupid 
stuffed toy she insisted on talking through. It was like being around a 
mystic.

With dismay, she reached the Dormitory gates, gazing up at the huge 
brown building in front of her.

There was nothing for it, she&#39;d have to face Nagisa-sama and take what 
was coming to her. An awful feeling in the pit of her stomach, she 
trudged up the steps to the front door, hoping the world was feeling 
merciful.

- - - - -

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I hit her,&quot; Shizuma sighed as she gazed down at the 
intricate patterns that covered the top of the green house high table. 
With her head in her hands, she tipped it sideways to glance across at 
Nagisa who was sat next to her, looking for some form of justification.

Nagisa sat silent however, a little uncomfortable with what she&#39;d heard 
through the wall between the sixth year&#39;s rooms, but concerned for 
Shizuma nonetheless. The comment about Kaori had certainly deserved the 
response it got she thought to herself.

Having abandoned the idea of tea, the two girls had locked Shizuma&#39;s 
room and decided to come to the green house, hoping to find the Etoile 
and sure this is the one place Miyuki wouldn&#39;t have enough courage to 
follow them.

Amane had been here to greet them, although the younger Etoile was 
nowhere to be seen. Carrying a tray with a fresh pot of tea and three 
china cups, Amane returned to the table.

&quot;She&#39;s certainly not the Miyuki I came to respect as council President,&quot; 
the tall Spican offered, &quot;I can&#39;t imagine her saying what she did.&quot;

Shizuma gazed across the green house absently, not feeling any better 
regardless.

&quot;I guess I only have myself to blame. I&#39;m forever making a mess of 
things.&quot;

Startled by the aloof comment, Nagisa and Amane looked at Shizuma with 
confused expressions. Very rarely had either of them heard Shizuma so 
self-defeating, something she&#39;d previously always kept for herself. 
Nagisa reached forward, taking the former-Etoile by the hand. Still 
unable to offer any words, she simply squeezed Shizuma&#39;s fingers and 
smiled fondly, bringing a spark of life back to the sullen face 
regarding her.

&quot;Hopefully that will be the end of it anyway,&quot; Amane remarked, pouring 
the tea. &quot;She must know she was out of line.&quot;

She looked around, deciding it was time to change the subject,

&quot;You know, I&#39;m kind of glad you two showed up.&quot; Sheepishly she scratched 
the side of her head and asked, &quot;You don&#39;t mind helping with the flowers 
this morning do you?&quot;

Thankful for the distraction, Shizuma grinned, looking up at the Etoile,

&quot;Where is Hikari anyway?&quot;

Amane shrugged,

&quot;I don&#39;t honestly know. I&#39;ve not seen her since this morning.&quot;

Nagisa added quietly,

&quot;She wasn&#39;t the best of colours; I think that champagne you plied us 
with went to her head a little.&quot;

Shizuma smiled coyly,

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to drink it...&quot;

But Amane moved the issue along quickly as she passed the girls their 
tea,

&quot;Either way, it&#39;s just me this morning, and I could really do with a 
hand if you&#39;re free.&quot;

Nodding in unison, the Miatorians agreed happily,

&quot;Of course Amane, point us at what needs doing.&quot;

- - - - -

Hikari lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling in the dim light of her 
Dormitory, watching as the textured plaster above her swayed slowly. 
Having spent a fair bit of the morning throwing up, she was still 
feeling quiet sick and certain she&#39;d over done it the previous night. 
She groaned as her stomach turned again, causing her to curl up in a 
ball, clutching herself in agony.

Not sure at which point the evening had taken the nose dive it did, she 
still couldn&#39;t shake the unnerving sense of upheaval that had led her to 
tears before Amane had found her. The day had been so much fun until 
Shizuma had insisted dressing Amane up; she remembered again the 
uncomfortable feeling she&#39;d felt as she looked at Amane in the dress, 
the sultry feminine form before her a stark contrast to the Amane-senpai 
she knew and loved. The same Amane-senpai she&#39;d spent months gazing at 
admiringly as she horse rode in the paddocks near the Spica school 
building.

She was unable to vocalise the feeling but knew, deep down, something 
was very wrong. It was the same feeling she&#39;d felt when Yaya had pressed 
her lithe form against the young Etoile, kissing her forcefully that 
night in their Dorm. The same feeling she felt every time she watched 
Shizuma and Nagisa kiss in front of her.

She groaned as her stomach spasmed again, the dull pain wrenching her 
into a ball.

Where was Yaya anyway?

The dark haired third year had promised to hurry back, noting how ill 
Hikari had looked and stressing she was only popping to the cathedral to 
get some song sheets. Something which had made little sense to Hikari at 
the time, given there would be no one there on a Sunday afternoon as the 
practices finished much earlier in the morning. Perhaps Yaya had left 
them there on a previous day. Either way, she&#39;d promised to come back 
soon, offering to keep Hikari company.

Pushing her sweaty hair from her face, she looked across the room at the 
bedroom door. She was unable to face Amane in this state as she&#39;d be too 
embarrassed at having so little stamina. She&#39;d also be unwilling to 
throw the rumour mill any more ammunition by wandering around the Spican 
sports area on a busy sunday afternoon in such a mess, looking for her 
fellow Etoile. Instead, she considered finding Yaya. The cathedral 
wasn&#39;t far, and she wasn&#39;t coping with her poorly state on her own, but 
certainly wasn&#39;t going to approach the Nurse for fear of awkward 
questions. As long as she had her dear friend with her, she was sure she 
would be fine.

Gingerly, she shuffled out of her bed and changed into uniform, making a 
vague attempt at tiding her pale face up before leaving the room on her 
way to the cathedral.

- - - - -

Chiyo rapped again on the door, her heart in her throat.

&quot;Aoi-sama?&quot; she called. &quot;Suzumi-sama?&quot;

No reply came from within the closed Dormitory door, and partially 
relieved, partially frustrated, the tiny first year turned away and 
started walking back toward her own room.

Now she would have to wait until the following day to explain herself to 
the older girls, meaning she&#39;d have to spend another sleepless night as 
she pondered the outcome.

The corridors were empty, most of the Dormitory girls either out engaged 
in recreational activities or off campus visiting relatives or shopping 
in town. It wouldn&#39;t be until much later that they&#39;d return.

Chiyo was happy for the solitude, and stomped along in her self-absorbed 
mood. Her day wasn&#39;t getting any better, and having spent all morning 
plucking her courage up, she was left feeling even worse knowing it had 
been for nothing.

All Shizuma&#39;s fault, she repeated to herself.

In fact, Chiyo was so wrapped up in her own little world, she almost 
walked straight into Kagome; the little Lulim girl stood waiting for 
Chiyo to notice her in the long corridor to the stair well.

Stopping dead in her tracks, Chiyo looked up just at the last moment, a 
vexed expression covering her face as her eyes passed over the checked 
uniform and she realised who her company was.

&quot;You!&quot; she exclaimed.

Kagome gripped Percival tighter and looked into the Miatorian&#39;s angry 
eyes.

&quot;Chiyo-chan?&quot; she mumbled in a small voice.

The room temp snapped,

&quot;I&#39;m not talking to you anymore. You&#39;ve ruined my life!&quot;

Kagome looked distraught and pleaded,

&quot;But Ohshibaru didn&#39;t know he was doing anything wrong. He didn&#39;t mean 
to get Chiyo-chan in trouble.&quot;

Despite the tears welling in the corner of the Kagome&#39;s big green eyes, 
Chiyo continued to rant,

&quot;Well you have, and now my onee-sama may never talk to me again. For all 
I know, she&#39;ll tell me she never wants to see me and I&#39;ll be the only 
room temp ever sacked in Miator&#39;s history!&quot;

He waved her hands wildly as she raged,

&quot;Do you know how embarrassing that will be Kagome? Do you know how 
stupid I&#39;ll look?&quot;

Kagome shrunk back from the angry figure in front of her, her face 
written with intimidation and dismay,

&quot;But Ohshibaru didn&#39;t mean any harm. He likes Chiyo-chan.&quot;

Chiyo snapped,

&quot;And stop it with that stupid bear! You&#39;re not a junior anymore, stop 
acting like such a little girl!&quot;

Something dark shifted inside Chiyo, and she grasped awkwardly at the 
stuffed toy cradled in Kagome&#39;s arms. In return for taking her beloved 
onee-sama, Chiyo was going to take something precious from Kagome too.

For a moment, the two girls struggled with each other, Percival 
stretched between them, hands pulling on him in every direction. Then, 
quietly at first, there was the ominous sound of ripping fabric, and 
horror flashed across Kagome&#39;s face as one of Percival&#39;s arm&#39;s came 
loose. Tears flooding to her eyes, she lost her grip and Chiyo swept the 
bear from her reach.

&quot;It&#39;s time you grew up Kagome!&quot; Chiyo shouted in a shrill voice, 
launching the bear across the hallway, stuffing floating across the 
carpet before he bounced into a corner, his demented gaze staring back 
as he lay there, looking ruined and dejected where he fell.

Kagome screamed, a soul piercing cry that filled the corridor and echoed 
down the hall beyond.

Stunned, Chiyo stepped backwards as the tiny Lulim girl raced to her 
damaged teddy, sweeping him up in her arms, cradling Percival as she 
gingerly tried pushing the escaping stuffing back into his open arm 
socket.

Chiyo felt a strange sensation wash over her, as though her head and 
body were floating far apart, and the first year shuffled uncomfortably 
as Kagome&#39;s cries continued, drawing attention from one of the older 
girls in a nearby dormitory.

Looking at the discarded arm at her feet, a strong sense of guilt rushed 
over Chiyo, and in a panic as the curious fourth year approached the 
pair, she turned and ran, leaving the Lulim girl grieving over her 
beloved teddy bear.

- - - - -

Hikari trudged her way through the ankle deep snow, shivering violently 
and struggling to contain the waves of nausea that washed over her. 
Looking back down the long path through the falling white flakes to the 
Dormitories beyond, she knew it was as far in that direction now as it 
was to the Cathedral, and the hope of finding Yaya tipped the balance of 
whether she should press on or return to the warmth of her room.

Despite her long white overcoat, the cold gripped her, and she stumbled 
onward, trying to pull it more tightly around her waist.

&quot;Yaya-chan will help me, she&#39;ll understand.&quot;

- - - - -

The Cathedral was eerily still, the girl&#39;s slightest moves reverberating 
around the high ceilings as though they&#39;d been thunderous and mighty. 
Yaya sat in the middle of one of the long wooden stalls facing the altar 
at the front, her heavy Spican overcoat lying underneath her, the 
playful figure of Tsubomi Okuwaka sat atop her lap, her skirt riding far 
too high, her eyes sparkling with a mischievous grin.

They&#39;d been here a while now, at first just fumbling about nervously in 
fear of being caught, the thrill adding to the experience. But as time 
had passed and newcomers had failed to materialize, the girls had become 
bolder, fumbling replaced by tentative kisses, replaced by their 
entwined figures and rising body temperatures.

Her shirt half undone and her heart beating furiously, Tsubomi leant 
forward, caressing the third year&#39;s face gently before exchanging a 
long, probing kiss, her long strawberry hair engulfing them both as it 
fell forward in loose flowing locks. Righting herself, she looked down 
at Yaya with a hungry gaze, questioning the older girl with anxious 
hesitation.

&quot;Well Yaya?&quot; she asked, &quot;How about it? Right here, in the middle of the 
cathedral!&quot;

Yaya squirmed, her mind torn in two directions, but the physical 
presence of the first year certainly keeping her attention.

However in the back of her mind was the promise she&#39;d made to Hikari, 
the Etoile&#39;s pale face and sickly state worrying her as she&#39;d left their 
Dormitory. She&#39;d been gone much longer than she intended, and she knew 
she should be getting back.

Tsubomi ran her finger tips across the older girl&#39;s chest, working their 
way across Yaya&#39;s stomach and towards the ruffled hem of her creased 
Spican skirt.

&quot;Well?&quot; Tsubomi pressed,

Yaya&#39;s back arched as Tsubomi&#39;s fingers reached their mark, her black 
hair cascading down the back of the wooden stall in the aisle behind 
them. A gentle breath escaped her lips and her eyes lost focus before 
closing slowly.

&quot;That a yes then?&quot; Tsubomi giggled, smiling as she worked away 
playfully.

Yaya looked up, her expression blank, absorbed in the moment, gazing 
longingly into Tsubomi&#39;s pea green eyes.

&quot;Quickly Tsubomi...&quot; Yaya mumbled, shifting in her seat.

Relief washed over Hikari as she reached the cathedral door, and she 
collapsed against the stonework, hugging it for a moment while she 
caught her breath and let the nausea subside. Clutching her painful 
stomach with one hand, the tiny Etoile pulled herself up with the other, 
dizziness washing over her with the effort.

She struggled into the doorway and out of the snow, entering the dim 
light of the cathedral beyond. Waiting for her eyes to adjust, she noted 
with increasing unease that her shivering wasn&#39;t stopping, yet her 
temperature seemed to have risen considerably. She definitely wasn&#39;t 
well, and she wondered whether traipsing out into the freezing cold 
while being so obviously dehydrated and ill had been such a clever idea. 
Her clothes were soaked, and her blonde hair hung about her in a 
dripping mess. Holding her forehead as the room slowly spun, she felt a 
sinking sense of panic wash over her.

She looked toward the altar beyond, and in the low light she could make 
out two figures in the stalls near the front.

Gingerly, she made her way forward to ask if they&#39;d seen Yaya. It was 
likely they would be Saintly Chorus members, and although a little 
embarrassing, there would be no shame to Amane-senpai in letting them 
see the younger Etoile in this state, most of the choir friendly enough 
after years of practicing together.

As the tiny Spican drew closer, she realised the figures were sharing 
the same aisle, one of them seemingly stood in front of the other deep 
in discussion.

Not wanting to disturb the important looking conversation, the third 
year slowed her pace, moving into the shadows beside the tall stone 
columns that flanked either side of the main cathedral hall. As she 
continued toward the front, her view was obscured by each of the wide 
circular pillars, and each time the figures came back into view, she 
could make out a little more.

By the time she was half-way to the altar, only one more pillar away 
from the couple, she could make out the white Spica uniform and bright 
strawberry hair of Tsubomi Okuwaka as she perched in front of the other 
figure who lay slumped in the high backed seat of the stall. She could 
just about hear the sound of their feint words, but couldn&#39;t make out 
what they were saying or who the other figure was.

If anyone was going to know where Yaya-chan was, Tsubomi would be the 
one Hikari thought to herself, and although the underclassman seemed to 
have been avoiding her since the Etoile election, she doubted Tsubomi 
would be unreasonable enough not to tell her if she knew Yaya-chan&#39;s 
location. She might even help the sick Etoile herself, although Hikari 
didn&#39;t trust her enough to relate the weekend&#39;s events.

She stepped forward, rounding the final pillar and peering at the 
couple. To her surprise, Tsubomi seemed to be sitting on the other 
person, her face flushed and her hair messy. She asked something in a 
low voice, waiting a moment before pressing the question again, her 
whisper still indistinguishable to Hikari.

Then to young girl&#39;s surprise, the other figure stretched backwards, 
long black hair cascading over the back of the wooden stall. In 
breathless words, she heard the dark haired girl reply in Yaya&#39;s 
familiar voice,

&quot;Quickly Tsubomi...&quot;

And with that the first year slipped backwards, disappearing from sight 
with a playful grin.

Hikari&#39;s head span, and she stepped forward from the pillar, standing 
next to the end of the aisle the girls shared as she stared at the 
couple before her.

Tsubomi was knelt on the floor before Yaya as the third year lay back in 
the seat, the first year&#39;s hands holding Yaya&#39;s white Spican skirt up 
around her waist, her face concealed by Yaya&#39;s slender thigh. As the 
lithe form of Hikari&#39;s room mate writhed in the seat, Tsubomi leant 
back, shifting her strawberry hair from her face with a flick of her 
neck, licking her glistening lips as she smiled vindictively at the 
breathless girl in front of her. Yaya looked back in agonising 
frustration, her eyes pleading before Tsubomi returned her attention to 
her previous task.

Hikari stood speechless, emotions washing over her. She&#39;d never seen two 
girls like this before; Hikari and Amane had never engaged in those 
kinds of things, Hikari content just to hold Amane&#39;s naked body, to kiss 
her and curl up together in the darkness, and thus far Amane had never 
pushed her for more. But Amane-senpai was so different to the others 
Hikari said to herself. Even if she had wanted more, it wouldn&#39;t have 
been the same with her as it might have been with them. At least, as 
long as it was the Amane-senpai she knew and loved, not the stranger 
she&#39;d faced in the department store wearing Shizuma&#39;s dress. Watching 
the scene before her; Yaya&#39;s feminine form arching across the stall, 
Tsubomi&#39;s soft strawberry hair cascading around them, it all seemed so 
different, so very, very wrong.

Finally, as Yaya&#39;s breathing hastened, the third year shifted her weight 
slightly and her thigh dropped away, allowing Hikari to see everything; 
leaving nothing more to her young imagination.

The Etoile&#39;s mind reeled, and images flashed before her of Yaya pressing 
herself against the tiny blonde in the confines of their dormitory, of 
Amane stood in the changing room wearing the burgundy cocktail dress, of 
Shizuma and Nagisa locked in a passionate embrace on the sofa at the 
summer house. The gut wrenching feeling of anxiety and unease that had 
hit her as she stood outside the changing rooms, that had led her to 
tears the previous evening washed back over her in stifling waves, 
threatening to overwhelm her. Self-doubt consuming the tiny Spican, she 
saw images in her mind of the elegant Amane-senpai atop Star Bride, the 
image warping hideously into the strange woman staring back at her from 
the department store changing room. She wanted to scream but couldn&#39;t, 
an anxious feeling of being dirty and unclean smothering her.

She looked down at her hands as she held her palms up towards her face. 
&#39;Is this what Amane-senpai sees in me?&#39; She asked herself, staring 
blankly at the stone floor of the cathedral. &#39;Is this what I truly am?&#39;

And then she looked up, her attention drawn by Yaya&#39;s gasp as her back 
arched and her eyes closed, tensing for a moment before collapsing into 
Tsubomi&#39;s waiting arms.

Something snapped, and in a shrill tone, Hikari opened her mouth and 
screamed.

Eyelids shut tight, her hands curled into fists so tight that her finger 
nails drew blood, she stood at the end of the aisle, her lungs burning 
as she let loose the ear piercing cry.

The two girls huddled in the stalls jumped with a start, and Yaya pushed 
Tsubomi off her as she hurriedly pulled her skirt down, turning to see 
the tiny form of the Spican Etoile running towards the cathedral door.

Confusion and her post-orgasm comedown washing over her, Yaya&#39;s heart 
thumped, panic overwhelming as she struggled to her feet, racing off 
after her room mate, unsure of what to do but unwilling to let her go 
whilst so hysterical.

Hikari burst from the cathedral, stumbling over the steps before 
collapsing on the snow covered ground beyond. She crawled forward a few 
paces and then came to a halt, kneeling on the spot, rocking back and 
forth as she clutched herself. She stayed there, despite the icy chill 
of the snow on her shins and the wind cutting into her through the thin 
fabric of her Spican uniform, the Etoile&#39;s heavy overcoat lying 
discarded behind her where she&#39;d originally fallen.

All the time, she continued to scream, the same shrill pitch piercing 
the air.

Yaya burst through the door behind her, scrambling down the steps before 
skidding to a halt next to the crumpled figure in the snow. She reached 
a hand out to touch the young Etoile on the ground before her, calling 
over the noise,

&quot;Hikari-chan?&quot;

Hikari&#39;s head snapped to face her, and as Yaya moved to touch her 
shoulder, the screaming stopped, Hikari&#39;s blue eyes flaring with an 
unfocused stare. She snarled defensively,

&quot;Don&#39;t touch me!&quot;

She continued, seemingly delirious and cradling herself gently,

&quot;Stop touching me, all of you! Get away, get away from me! I don&#39;t want 
it, I don&#39;t like it...&quot;

The shouting subsided, overwhelmed by rising tears and heavy sobs, 
becoming a mumble of gibberish. She fell forward, huddled in a ball in 
the snow, repeating over and over,

&quot;I want to go home, I want to go home...&quot;

Frightened and unnerved by the young Etoile&#39;s reaction, Yaya knelt next 
to her, helplessly staring at the sobbing figure in wide eyed horror and 
concern.
