<p><em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I had a  dream… it was warm and nice but kinda weird… I don’t want to wake up;  really, I just want to stay asleep. Dreams are always much nicer than  reality, so soft and comforting. Well, apart from nightmares. They used  to come up. Less so now, actually. I’m here, not there. There always  had a bad aura, if I can say something that stupid. But, well, the bed  was more comfortable than here. And I had a room of my own. It still  wasn’t too nice, though… even if I did have a good dream, a servant  would drag me out of bed all too early. Of course, this isn’t any  different, this school. Still have to get up. But later. That’s nice.  And, it’s hard to place exactly, especially when I’m in a room with her  of all people, but it just seems safer here. Safer than home. That’s  pretty depressing. Forget it. Just let me lie here for a little while  longer. That’s all I want. That’s all I need. </span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you going to lay there forever or what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi mumbled something discontented and sat, shaking out her hair and yawning hugely. “I want to…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly,”  Kaname said. “I’m already dressed. Me getting up first is some kind of  crime against history. You shouldn’t have stayed up so late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wanted to finish my book,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  never understood how you got so into reading,” Kaname said. “I mean, I  read, but it doesn’t deserve the effort you put into it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just read the right books.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trashy romances?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That book was not a trashy romance,” Momomi said sulkily. “I don’t read that kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks like one to me,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, read it, then, and tell me that afterwards!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright,” Kaname said, shrugging. “I’ll probably take longer than you to read it, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph.  It’ll be good for you.” Momomi said. She brushed a thick lock of  tangled hair out of her eyes. “What are you looking at, anyway? Very  pensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m looking at this,” Kaname said, holding up a letter. “It’s for you. A dispatch from High Command, Italy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?  Give me that!” Momomi leapt off the bed and lunged across the room,  ripping it from her hands. “Don’t you dare touch my mail! Especially  anything from my parent’s place!” She retreated to her bed and sat,  staring fiercely down at the letter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Well, I  didn’t read it or even open it. Just guessed at the contents. My  money’s on some kind of arranged marriage, that seems like the next  step on your much resented road of destiny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi ripped it open and picked it up, reading fiercely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  from what I can see on the front, your family, or at least someone  working of them, has excellent Japanese,” Kaname said. “Just like you.  Your accent’s better than mine, it’s pretty shameful.” There was no  reply, so she just shrugged. “Fine, then. I guess your family’s so much  more important than-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a tearing sound. Kaname turned  and blinked, watching as Momomi ripped the letter to pieces with a  controlled, baleful thoroughness. Then she collected up the scraps of  paper and dropped them in the bin, before turning her back on it and  throwing herself moodily onto her bed. “Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bad news, I take it,” Kaname said lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stupid, stupid news,” Momomi said. “God, it pisses me off!” She hugged her pillow, looking angry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my phrase,” Kaname said. “I’ve been a bad influence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed and sat on her bed, looking up at the ceiling. “Reminds me how  lucky I am, that my mother hasn’t written. She’d only preach, but I’m  used to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t receive any letter,” Momomi said moodily. “Understood?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not my business. I’ll humour you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And if you try and pick it out of the bin, I’ll never forgive you,” Momomi said. “Even after you’re dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  don’t think I’d root through the trash just to read some letter from  your family,” Kaname said. “I’m not that interested in why you’re being  huffy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’d better get dressed,” Kaname said eventually. “It’s, what, ten minutes before the last five minutes of breakfast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  scowled and stood, reaching for her clothes. “Fine. I shouldn’t give  them the satisfaction of me sulking whether they can see it or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a healthy attitude,” Kaname said. “I’d thought you were ill for a moment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry to disappoint you.” Momomi looked down, still looking livid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “You want, I can go on ahead. I’m not too eager to be round someone that pissy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s what you want.” Kaname opened the door, then hesitated for a moment. “Oh, and Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you want it, too, I can help you, my style,” she said. “I’ve found few  problems that can’t be solved, short term, with excessive violence. And  as it’d be me doing it, you wouldn’t even be blamed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s this? Concern from Kaname?” Momomi said arrogantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  glanced at her, looking dark. “I’m not through with you yet, that’s  all. And if your family pisses you off better than I annoy you, that  makes me angry on multiple levels.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t want you to  fight,” Momomi said. “I’m not going to be a hypocrite about that.  Besides, this is my business. The best help you can be is to stay the  hell out of my way!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you don’t control me,” Kaname said. “On any level. Remember that.” She turned and left without another word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged on her jacket, tugging on it to pull out a crease, and  buttoned it up, before reaching for her necktie. She took a breath,  closing her eyes for a moment, then opened them and carried on. <em>This  has left me… ragged. I don’t feel good. My damn blasted useless  horrible family. And Kaname, too. She’s left me feeling raw and  vulnerable, and scared and emotional as well. She reaches out a hand,  she yanks it away, whatever she does I’m mesmerised by it, and I blame  myself for it. That’s pretty scary. She’s really, genuinely getting  through to me. Since when she get so good? Since when was I so weak? I  thought I’d put all that behind me. I should have been more careful. It  might be immaterial now. I’m running risks, just being round her. It  feels like that. I can’t stand having my life move beyond my control  any more, and she does that. At least our hatred was regular, almost  soothing, and more or less an act. Perhaps we’ve got smarter. But it’s  all a lot more real now. Real means no script. Real leaves me far too  helpless. At the same time, I want to stay at this school. I only have  one friend, she’s more of an enemy, and there’s really nothing here for  me. I say its about my freedom, but sometimes I wonder… is this kind of  freedom worth it? The sisters’ rules, the bullying, everything else  here, it’s hardly freedom. At the same time, this room, this place,  those words, perhaps they matter now. Perhaps I’m a fool. </em>She scowled. <em>That  doesn’t matter now. It’s all irrelevant, and if I fail it’ll all be  gone. I want to stay. They want me to go. That’s all that matters. This  is the real freedom, I’m fighting for it now- freedom while they ignore  me is nothing. I’m only free if I win this battle. And whatever Kaname  says, I’ll have to fight it alone. </em>She pulled her firmly into place, scowled against her reflection, and turned to run towards the canteen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>All  the same, though. It wasn’t wise to antagonise Kaname. She’s tougher  than that, but I don’t need to deal with a resurgence of her  confrontational behaviour on top of this crisis. </em>Momomi sighed, biting her lip as she queued for breakfast. <em>I  miss the servants at home. They were the best part of home. Besides,  I’m behaving as Kaname expects me to behave. I should copy her tactics,  and be more unpredictable. If I sound a little sorry, that’ll unsettle  her. </em>She ordered without really thinking about it, grabbing the meal as soon as she could and looking round, sighing. <em>Why does that</em><em>in turn sound like an excuse?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked up as she approached. “Oh? I thought you were doing this alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not going to let you get away for duration,” Momomi said, darkly,  sitting down. “No way. Besides… that wasn’t what I meant to say. And I  wasn’t very fair to you. I should ask nicely, regardless of what you’d  make of that, because being nasty is only playing into your hands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph,”  Kaname said. “I don’t know what’s going on, because you won’t let me  know. But I won’t make any promises until I know exactly what’s going  on. Even then, only maybe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can’t tell you anything,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I can’t make any promises.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. But still… this is my business. I have to do it alone. I can’t stop you interfering, but it’s far from welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t care about welcome,” Kaname said. “Saying this is your own battle  sounds really cool. But I’ve been doing that all my life, and it’s not  a great way to live. Because that’s all about pride…” she closed her  eyes, “but if someone’s offering you help- whether it’s from stupid  altruism or their own selfish agenda or just some reason you can’t see-  there’s no reason not to take it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand that,” Momomi said. “But this is about who I am. No one but me can do anything about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph. That’s arrogant,” Kaname said. “Neither of us are utterly untouchable. You taught me that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. <em>Her, too? Am I reading too much into that?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi Kiyashiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked up, grimacing. “Yes, Sister?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please come to the Superior’s Office. As soon as you have finished.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Sister.” She sighed audibly. <em>Here we go. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname watched hawkishly as the Sister walked off. “So this is far more than just a letter from your parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s still not your business,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are they withdrawing you from this school?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you ask that, all of a sudden?” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I’m no fool. It’s one of a very small number of possibilities that make any sense at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not your business,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be the judge of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha.” Momomi pushed her breakfast away and stood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should eat more,” Kaname said. “You should, in fact, look after yourself more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess you’d know,” Momomi said. “There’s no time for that in a battle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn’t that kind of battle,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll be the judge of that,” Momomi mimicked. “Because, whatever you say, it isn’t your battle. I’ll be back, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just scowled and stared at her. “I’ll hold you to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi walked away, frowning. <em>Don’t  stay stuff like that. It messes with my head. Damn. I can’t get  distracted. Not now. So why is the common, coarse ice princess saying  things like that now? That’s so nonsensical, it suits her, but it still  annoys me. Almost as much as that guarantee. Just who am I talking to,  anyway? </em>She walked through the corridors of the Strawberry Dorms  without really seeing anything or anyone. No one worth seeing. Then she  walked round a corridor, and almost collided with Amane. They passed  each other without a word, without even looking up. Momomi felt her now  ingrained frown deepen. <em>A worst enemy who barely knows I exist. Sometimes I can make sense of Kaname’s hatred. </em>She  carried on walking, mind still churning. The route you took to the  Superior’s office was completely instinctive to her now. She was there  several times herself, though a lot less than she could have been. <em>Kaname,  on the other hand, seems to live there, and I have to pick that girl  up, drag her out, or lie through my teeth in her defence all the damn  time. It’s very troublesome of Kaname to act like that.</em><em>But half  the time, she’s in trouble in my defence. I’ve never been sure why  either of us do that. I guess it’s as Shion says. We may fight all the  time, but everyone else is still everyone else, where we’re us. </em>She stepped up to the dark wood of the door, and knocked twice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi opened the door and stepped in, nodding slightly. “Superior.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi Phareli,” a voice said softly. “We haven’t met much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  head shot up. She looked round, and saw a beautiful girl dressed in  Miator’s black, sitting on a chair at the side of the room. Graceful,  silver-blonde hair spilled over her shoulders, and her eyes were a  brilliant blue. A red pendant lay across her breast. “Etoile-sama,”  Momomi said, recovering her poise. “I’m sorry, I didn’t see you. Oh,  and I prefer Kiyashiki, here. ”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As you please. In your turn,  call me Serané, please,” the girl said quietly. “It’s good to see you.  I’ve heard a lot about you from Kariya-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Momomi  said. “That’s good. I think. But… it’s a pleasure to meet you, I’m  sure. I’ve only seen you at a distance, before.” <em>So this is the other Etoile. She’s nothing like Kariya-sama. I guess opposites really do attract.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My Aunt Francoise asks to be remembered to your father,” Serané said. “They have met a few times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lady Francoise Diralna? Then you are…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané  Diralna, daughter of the Earl Diralna,” Serané said. “I apologise for  my parents’ behaviour in not visiting your family after the marriage.  They have been inexcusable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s nothing I worry about,”  Momomi said. “And it’s not your fault.” She looked desperately at the  Superior, in the vague hope of release. She hated talking aristocracy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané, you can catch up with Kiyashiki-san at a later time, can you not?” the Superior said pointedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Serané said. “I apologise. It can get very lonely here, though  everyone is so kind… even an individual from a country a distant as  Italy becomes close to home, relative to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You miss being home?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Serané said. “Though I am very glad I came here. It has been  good for me, and I have made many friends. And I have met Kariya-sama.  But I’m not here to talk about myself. Again, I apologise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have to apologise,” Momomi mumbled. <em>There’s  something disgustingly perfect about this girl. A dyed in the wool  aristocratic heir, who doesn’t know how lucky she is. Then again,  that’s so perfect on her I do wonder what she’s hiding…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, you probably know why you are here,” the Superior said,  steepling her fingers. “Your parents have sent us a letter, telling us  informally that they intend to remove you from this school within the  week. Once the paperwork and details have been finalised, and transport  arranged, you will be taken back to Italy, and your home. It is our  duty to make that transition as easy as possible. That is the final  courtesy that we can extend to your family after this brief term of  service.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t make it sound so commercial, Superior,” Serané said. “It’s very crass.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This <em>is </em>a private school,” Momomi said. “In any case, there’s been a mistake. I won’t be leaving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You won’t?” the Superior said. “But I have the letter here…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  was written before I was through with them,” Momomi said. “They didn’t  even bother to consult me. Give me five minutes on the phone, and  you’ll be receiving an extortionate amount of money from my family for  years to come. And you can get back to being rude to me too. This  politeness thing is creeping me out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané giggled, the most  expressive thing Momomi had heard her utter. “You do sound very  determined,” the Etoile said, recovering her composure. “But are you  sure about that? I can understand possessing affection for this school,  but in your case- I’d have thought you wouldn’t mind coming home to  your family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not our business,” the Superior said. “It’s a matter for Kiyashiki-san and her family, and them alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,”  Serané said. “It’s my business, as Etoile. I am here to ask such  questions. She can answer or not as she pleases. But you can’t stop me  from asking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. <em>So she has some steel buried in  her after all. The way she answered that question, reminds me of  Kaname. And to talk back to the very Superior like that- being the  Etoile must be incredible. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Superior sighed. “Do you have an answer, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My mind is made up,” Momomi said. “My reasons are my own. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané smiled. “I’m glad. It seems you’ve really come to love Astraea Hill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s a quarter truth at best. </em>“In any case, can I call my parents? They’ll accept charges, I’m sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané nodded gracefully. “I should think so, too. And send my regards. I’ll wait outside.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” Momomi glanced between her and the Superior, and wondered who exactly was in charge. <em>Really, really incredible…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  waited until they had stepped outside, then paused for a moment, taking  a deep breath and collecting herself. She marshalled the arguments  she’d use in the upcoming clash. Well… no point in hanging around. She  picked up the phone and keyed in the number, placing the receiver to  her ear with a shaking hand. She felt her stomach knot as the ringing  went on. Calm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Hello?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Italian. She hadn’t heard that language in some eight months. She didn’t miss it, either. <em>“Hello. This is Momomi. Get me my father, now. Whatever he’s doing”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes, ma’am. I believe the master is free… please bear with me.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Hurry up.” </em>She  leaned back, trying to clear her mind. It was depressing, how  profoundly the mere thought of him could mess with her head. Whatever  Kaname could achieve, at least that was in an almost good way. This was  nothing like that. She drummed her fingers on the desk.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Momomi. This had better be good.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  asking you to reconsider your decision to take me out of here,” Momomi  said, slipping back into Japanese to annoy him. Childish, and unwise,  but it was hard to resist. Besides, her voice just didn’t sound right  in Italian any more. “It would be extremely disruptive to my education,  which has already been damaged. Astraea Hill has an excellent  reputation and is cheaper than my private tutors. I also suspect that  my sister would prefer to remain the only heir in the house-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Were you under a misapprehension that I am giving you a choice?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That bluntness. She hated it. “I’m asking you to reconsider-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That  won’t happen. You’ve been out there for too long. I don’t want to  speculate what they’ve done to your personality. I should never have  listened to your mother.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something snapped. “Technically, if you mean listened truly, you wouldn’t have sent me away at all,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Laughter. But not a friendly kind of laughter. <em>“No, this hasn’t blunted your impudence at all. Taking you back’s too good for you… but the decision is made. That is final.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one asked me!” Momomi said. “I don’t want to go back to you! You don’t want me back either, so just let me do that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You seem to be forgetting some very important things,” </em>he said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Firstly, I’m your father. I have ordered you to come back, and that’s final.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, general,” Momomi said through her teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Secondly, you’d do well to remember just who is paying for your presence at that school.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand that,” Momomi said. “Still, I’m just suggesting that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Thirdly. Don’t use that filthy language to address me.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snapped. “Shut up! Let me finish!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>The details will be finalised within two days. You will be home within a week. Otherwise, I’ll send men to drag you home.” </em>He hung up before she could reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You bastard…” She stared at the receiver in furious frustration. <em>Perhaps the heat of my gaze can run down the phone and cremate the arrogant prat. </em>“Always  have to have the bloody last word, don’t you?” If she’d talked to her  mother, she’d have agreed. But mother was so powerless. That really  annoyed her. Mother was weak, pathetic, and useless. It was almost an  embarrassment to talk to her. Especially when she cried. So forget it.  She slammed the phone down, and wondered what came next. Time to get  out of this office, for now. If Serané said something innocent and  graceful as if everyone had a family they loved, Momomi didn’t think  she could take it. She stood, shaking slightly, then opened the door  and stepped through.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How did it go?” Serané asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re thinking about it,” Momomi said tonelessly. “They’ll let you know in a few days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see. It must be hard for them, though, to have their daughter so far away…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi clenched her fists.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  they also sound a little difficult,” Serané said. “I wouldn’t know,  really. Perhaps they’re glad. I know I’m glad you’re here, and want to  be here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi made a cynical noise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I don’t seem to be the only one. You have a good friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked up and saw Kaname, leaning against the opposite wall and looking  down at the floor. “What? How long have you been there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More or less duration,” Kaname said. “I owe your parents a punch. I don’t do your ladylike slap thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  I must once again restate that this is no excuse to skip lessons,” the  Superior said angrily. “Especially not to eavesdrop on people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  show a genuine concern for one’s friends,” Serané said. “I admire that.  I would be worried if Kenjou-san didn’t do this. It’s good they’re  friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop that,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were both so isolated before,” Serané said. “In any case, though, I’d better take my leave for now. Remember, if you need <em>any </em>help, come to me and Kariya. That’s what we do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too  well,” the Superior said. “So well, you’re both excused from this  period. Before the Etoile suggests it. Come back to me when you have  more information.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you,” Momomi managed, despite herself. “Etoile-sama, Superior. Kaname, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No orders,” Kaname said. “But I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  lead, walking through the corridors. She didn’t know exactly where she  was going, but she wasn’t in any mood to stand still. She felt weird.  “So,” she said eventually. “Explain yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think that’s necessary,” Kaname said. “You didn’t made it sound necessary, earlier, though you’re very fickle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I ask out of interest,” Momomi said, frowning. <em>Still messing with my head. </em>“Missing lessons isn’t responsible. It’s one of the few things you don’t do often, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Academic study is a necessity of my position here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s hardly what I meant,” Momomi said, sounding irritated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t want me to get involved with this, so I was determined to,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced sharply back at her, but there was a certain something there.  She changed tack. “Hmm? Is that all? I’d say it’s very unlike you to  want to be involved with anything that doesn’t immediately concern you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get any funny ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you, too. If you say something cliché like<em> I’ll protect you </em>or whatever…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“ I’m not making any promises,” Kaname said. “To do that, or not. But you’re so weak you’ll need it whether I do or don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unlike you, I don’t resolve all my problems with brute strength,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not always enough,” Kaname said. “Maybe you’ve never encountered such a  moment, but being smart isn't always enough. And I’m bloody smart. I’m  here because of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s hard to tell,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. You too, actually. But I’ll tell you another cool-sounding cliché. <em>This is my problem. I’ll take care of it myself. </em>That kind of stupidity irritates me. That’s why I was there, whether you wanted me there or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’ll live with you being there,” Momomi said reluctantly. “You’re not  giving me any choice. And… well, if you’re here, and you have heard  everything… I’ll make the best of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re very fickle today,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  giving me no choice,” Momomi said. “And if you’ll forgive me, I’m not  currently at the top of my game, okay? I’ve no time for our games.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so,” Kaname said. “You’d fool me, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph.  In any case…” Momomi frowned. “I don’t know quite why I’m so mad about  staying here. Probably just to rebel. But I’ve made that decision. And  you’ve also made sense, too much sense. I’m not going to allow you to <em>not </em>help me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, my sublime lady,” Kaname said sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides, you’re the least worst person here to have covering my back,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha,” Kaname said. “One penniless social reject. Are you sure that your friend the great Etoile-sama wouldn’t be more help?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s irritating,” Momomi said. “She might be a help. But she’s too good. Too nice. I don’t have the luxury of fighting fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where are we going, anyway?” Kaname asked abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…” Momomi sighed, then shrugged. “If you weren’t arguing with me all the damn time, I’m notice where I was going more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re a hopeless leader,” Kaname said. “This is hardly the first time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you don’t have to follow me,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You won’t let me not help you, in theory,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In practise, I choose to follow you. I don’t know why, but I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s very confusing of you,” Momomi said. “In any case… let’s go to the lake. I need some fresh air.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not like I have any better ideas.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted as she finally set a coherent course. <em>I  feel seriously displaced right now. A crisis the size of my current one  will do that to you. But I don’t know, immediately, what to think or  do. And Kaname’s right, I’ll say three different things in as many  moments and feel emotions to match. It’s annoying. Glad she’s here,  cross she’s here, resigned that she’s here… is that her or me? We’re  both pretty fickle, mostly just to annoy each other. And when I say it  like that, it sounds kinda pointless.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You still there?” Kaname asked sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let me think,” Momomi said. “This is a time for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Think out loud, then. What did your father say? I caught the gist without detail.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  amazed,” Momomi said. “He has a carrying voice. Just say he’s a  stubborn pig, and he’ll drag me back now simply because I don’t want to  go home, and he can tell that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds insecure,” Kaname said. “Pathetic, really, if you don’t mind me saying so. Bullying a useless little girl like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think you know everything there is to know about insecurity, so I’ll  trust you on that,” Momomi said. “But the big problem is that he  controls the money. No fees, no school. That, and I don’t think it’s  school policy to favour the will of students over those of parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This does sound like a time for your methods, not mine,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, the first thing is finances. That’s easy. You’ll just have to pass the scholarship tests.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  aren’t they supposed to be stupidly hard?” Momomi asked. She couldn’t  believe that solution hadn’t immediately occurred to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I did them,” Kaname said sardonically. “I can train you up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. I’m sure I won’t have any problems with anything you can do,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  have to take renewal tests, so I start study at Christmas,” Kaname  said. “It’s old news to me, but for you, it’ll be far more interesting.  I won’t go easy on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever,” Momomi said. “That still  leaves a gap between the end of this term and the end of the year, and  I doubt I can take them early.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yes,” Kaname admitted. “That’s an area I still need to work out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Plus  I need to get round the simple fact that my parents want me home, when  I’m here, and the school’s bound to listen to them,” Momomi said. “But  don’t answer that. This school gives a stupid amount of influence to  the Etoiles and the Student Councils. If we can get some of them,  somehow, to take an interest, then that might be enough. Maybe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  constructively, I’d point out that Kariya has been a casual antagonist  of me in particular since forever,” Kaname said. “Something to do with  me being a troublemaker. And Serané has an obsession with family. Oh,  and we’re… not to put too fine a point on it… generally as popular as a  big game hunter at a conservationist’s convention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You use  random similies,” Momomi said. “Believe me, straight talking suits you  better. But in any case, I know all that. I’ll work on it. I’ll think  of something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They stepped out into the sunlight. “Whatever,” Kaname said. “We’d both better think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  our first priority, though,” Momomi said. “If we don’t gain some kind  of foothold immediately, I’ll just be taken away without comment.  There’s always the chance of a direct confrontation, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my area,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  as a last resort,” Momomi said. “If you, known to be as close as anyone  gets to me, assaults the people my parents send, that’d pretty much end  our chances. And I need money to cover a term, and then to somehow pass  the scholarship tests at the end of the year. This is going to be…  interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A challenge,” Kaname said. “I’ll enjoy screwing over your rich, bratty parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So will I, actually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But one thing, to justify all those <em>we’s</em>,” Kaname said. “You have an advantage over me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?” Momomi asked warily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you pretty much everything there is to know about me, that one  time,” Kaname said. “I want you to return the favour now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blushed and shrugged. “My story’s not as exiting as yours. But if you like, I’ll tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, as soon as we get to the lake,” Momomi said.</span></p>
