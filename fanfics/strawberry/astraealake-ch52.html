Kaname lay  back on the grass and looked at the sky, glad for the cool air around  her. It was a welcome sensation, when she was sweltering inside. As  ever, the lake’s clear surface below her was strangely beautiful. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  odd. I don’t particularly like natural beauty, for the most part, but  there’s something I can appreciate about that lake. Perhaps how clear  and still and empty it is? I’m not very used to that, but that makes it  peaceful as well as merely beautiful, when I’m feeling antisocial. Or  it might be the fact that Momomi’s long shadow is cast over it. I can  still remember most of it. Momomi talked about her parents and her  sister and her mistakes, the way she acted and who she was. She didn’t  try and make herself look good or play on my emotions; she just said  everything, so simply. I'd found it weird before then that I should  have trusted anyone with what I told her, but it had felt right, even  if I hadn’t wanted to admit that to myself. When she hugged me, that  was the same. Even if I pretended to myself that I found it bizarre, it  was actually powerful…touching. I wasn’t very used to the idea that  someone would hold me and feel my pain when they had nothing to gain. I  certainly wasn’t used to the idea that they’d entrust their pain and  misery, in turn, to me. That’s what it was for her, even if she put a  brave face on everything. And I talked about feminism and the role of  women in the army. Well, it’s not like I have ever pretended I’m good  at that kind of thing. To be honest, I think this is fine. If she takes  these things seriously, I have to be the one to make light of them. If  people couldn’t do that they’d be crushed by the weight of the miseries  in this world. Still, she was the one that taught me how easily we can  forget all that, if we know someone else cares. </span></em>Kaname turned her head, looking sideways across the grass and watching the leaves flutter beneath the shadows of the trees. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  this is nostalgic. Things were very different then. Very stupid and  very defensive and very tentative and very awkward. We crept closer,  darted back, danced around each other, because we were afraid of being  hurt. Both more complicated and also simpler than how things are now.  That doesn’t matter, though. The past is gone.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But right now,  I’m so… tired. That’s pretty much all I can think about. I guess  emotions can’t come out of nowhere, they’re very draining if you feel  them for too long. Just like the demons in all those stories, who lend  you great power but cannibalise or try to take over your body,  something like that, a cursed strength. That sounds like me. I’m no  bloody paladin. I can’t defeat my opponents without using their methods  and becoming like them. Unlike Amane, who is the strangest kind of  person. A saint who isn’t saintly. A goddess that doesn’t have to be  kind. Simply put, she doesn’t have to behave in good ways to be treated  as a wonderful person, because of the way that people perceive her.  Like a paladin of a dark god, beautiful and walking in the light. No,  not exactly. She’s someone without any particular affiliation, and  she’s never claimed to be anything else. But somehow people treat her  that she’s a good person. How she acts doesn’t come into things. </em>Kaname smiled weakly. <em>I  wish I knew that kind of trick, whatever it is. If I’m doing bad  things, I’ll look like a bad person. I’m always doing bad things, so  everyone resents me. But even if I don’t like that, at least it’s fair.  At least there’s a reason. Amane’s worship is in acknowledgement  of…something…nothing tangible, perhaps just a shadow of her, or a dream  of her, or a dream of a thing. I’m not sure. I’m not an Amane fangirl.  Either way, those games and stories have it all wrong. Beautiful people  will have a beautiful reputation, while ugly people will have the  opposite. In body, or in personality. They do that anyway, though,  because it’s never the good guys who are ugly. What a simple world.  Nothing tricky and deceptive like Amane. Or Momomi, come to that.  Perhaps that’s why I never found that kind of story interesting.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  idly rubbed her bloodied knuckles, sighing deeply and closing eyes. Her  hands hurt, and it was difficult to move her fingers. <em>That’s not  the point, though. I feel tired, so very tired, but I can’t sleep.  Well, for a start, it’s the middle of the day. On top of that, I’m due  in our room come lunchtime. But most of all, the thoughts haven’t gone  away even if the feelings have. It’s driving me insane, just going  round and round in my head, until I don’t see or hear or think anything  else. That’s the worst part of all. I’ve stopped trying to work things  out, it’s just too hard. Right now, all I want to do is forget about  all of it. Or failing that, to at least find some respite in sleep. </em>She sighed, idly picking and shredding the grass by her left hand. <em>I  don’t like this. I prefer to take the initiative, action, bring the  fight to the enemy, all those things. I’m better with action because  you don’t need to know precisely what you are doing. You can make it up  as you go along. It’s been futile, though, I’ve just been thrashing  about and achieving nothing, upsetting Momomi, amusing Amane, all of  it…it all makes me feel ineffective. But this is no good, either. I  feel so lazy and exhausted I can’t face anything. I don’t want another  row with Momomi right now, even if it’s necessary, because I don’t have  the strength in me. Anything else I could do just feels so…tiring. If  passion is my weapon, then I’m currently disarmed. Not because I don’t  care. I care far too much. But because I’ve been struggling too hard  for too long, and I don’t have the strength right now. Thinking is no  better. I’m just twisting pointlessly, and while my tiredness impedes  that and stops me from digging deeper, the circular nature of my  thoughts only reinforce my tiredness. Simply put, I’m useless right  now. </em>Kaname’s wandering fingers managed to find a piece of gravel.  She picked it up and threw it at the lake without sitting up. A gentle  plop was heard. <em>Well, pure action and pure thought have both failed  completely. I guess I should try combined arms, as past generals might  put it. In other words, think first then run in. But not right now. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sighing  again, Kaname folded her hands beneath her head, trying to check their  wandering. It was suddenly grating on her. Even when she was like this,  it was impossible to feel at peace. Kaname frowned at the sky. <em>Things  were… simpler, before. I don’t mean the days when we were at war,  though that was pretty simple, nor the rising uncertainty that was  actually very complicated, nor the time when we went against Momomi’s  family, and certainly not after…so I suppose I actually mean a before  that never actually existed. But I wish things were simpler, all the  same. That would better. If we were both best friends, and neither of  us wanted more, and we could just be eccentric companions forever, us  against the world. If Momomi didn’t want to prove herself to everyone  else in this school or if I craved the same acknowledgement as her,  with the same confidence and flair. Or if she was happy to stay like  this for me forever. Or if we feel for each other neatly and simply,  just like a story, and confessed and dated and were girlfriends,  returning each other’s feelings, holding each other close. If we lived  without any of this trouble and pain and uncertainty. </em>Kaname smirked. <em>If  we had a perfect relationship, in other words, that would be nice. I’m  pretty self-pitying right now, so I won’t permit myself to wonder  whether the current situation is unfair. This is the way life works.  People change, their feelings change, they fall in and out of interests  and associations, friendship and love. Nothing’s a static picture,  which makes long-term relationships such a strange framing of time and  feeling, as far as I can see. Momomi’s mistakes, my mistakes, Amane’s  presence, these things happen. Life doesn’t exist for my convenience,  and I’m not anyone’s idea of a heroine. Even if I say that, though, it  doesn’t make me feel any better about things. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname checked her watch. <em>Almost  time. Actually, I’m dreading it. I just don’t want to face any of that  right now. I don’t want to have to face Momomi. I don’t want to have to  explain things to her when I can’t even explain them to myself. If I  could find an excuse, I wouldn’t go. I have no choice, though. I have  to prepare both of us for those exams, for a start. More importantly, I  can’t just lie here and rot all day. I won’t achieve anything  constructive and I’ll make her worry. I hope she is worrying. It’d be  very painful if she’d accepted. Even so, I have to know for sure. I  just wish I knew how to tell her why I know for sure. That’s a third  reason to go. For myself, in pure and simple selfishness. Always  something I can understand very readily. </em>Deciding that she’d  procrastinated more than was necessary, perhaps more than was actually  forgivable, Kaname pushed herself up and stood. She staggered slightly  and touched her head, feeling the blood rush from it and dizzy her,  hazing her sight for a few moments. <em>Damn. Looks like I really did lounge around for too long. </em>When she’d recovered herself, she brushed herself off, trying to remove the grass. <em>White  jackets…yeah, great plan, whoever designed this bloody uniform. The one  thing Miator got right were the nice black dresses, hiding any  discoloration. Like this, I’ll be covered in grass-stains and will then  have to explain nicely to Momomi oneesama why they’re there when I  should be in lessons. She’s the one who will insist on cleaning them,  after all. Oh, well. I’ll just have to act casual again. </em>Kaname  adjusted her necktie again, having loosened it earlier to give her more  air. She checked her reflection in the lake, trying to press down her  hair. <em>God, I’m making such a fuss about this, aren’t I? </em>Feeling  slightly uneasy at the thought, she stuck her hands casually in her  trouser pockets and glanced at her reflect again, cocking her head the  casual way she did. She’d probably look better without muddy elbows,  but these things happened. Kaname turned and walked back towards the  dorms, trying to dismiss her simmering nerves.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thankfully, she  managed to get inside the doors before the beg rang and without the  unwanted attention of a Sister. By now, there was only a minute before  lunch, though. <em>I’d rather go without more questioning on what is  going on between Momomi and Amane. They wouldn’t believe me when I told  them what I know and there are also dangerously large gaps where I  don’t know. If I admitted that, the significance of that could be  exaggerated. Something like that would be troublesome. </em>That was  the reason she gave herself for hurrying back to her room, closing the  door after she walked in and throwing herself onto her bed. She buried  her face in her pillow, enjoying the smell of her own heat and sweat  and slumber. <em>Ironic, really, but it looks like my own antisocial  tendencies are intensifying just as hers are weakening. Actually,  they’re related. That doesn’t help with my feelings of alienation…but  that’s not her fault. I can understand what she wants to achieve, and  I’ll help her achieve it. That kind of thing is something I’ve become  accustomed to doing. Just, well, some other time, when I’m not angsty,  stressed and exhausted. That’d be nice. </em>She at like that for a few  minutes, waiting while she rested her body and tried to rest her mind.  After a while, she pushed herself up and walked over to the work desk.  Momomi kept all the textbooks they had neatly piled beneath, but the  new books they’d borrowed from the library had been stored temporarily  by Kaname. In other words, she’d stuck them in random piles and pushed  them out of sight and mind with her feet. As ever, she was forced to  reflect on the virtues of the Kiyashiki way while searching half-blind  for three slim books on the theory of history and the form of  historical writing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname placed two on top of the desk,  retreating to her bed with the other. She put her back to the wall and  closed her eyes for a moment, then concentrated and began to read the  first few pages. Before, she’d always relied on common sense to slide  past this aspect of the history paper, but it’d probably be better if  she studied for it this time around. It had always been a weakness of  hers and this time around things were likely to be even harder. She was  finding it hard to concentrate, though. <em>It doesn’t help that this  blasted prose is so thick. And history is one of my preferred subjects,  damnit! I could care less why the academic community considers it a  relevant study, as far as I’m concerned it’s all for the battles and  wars. That’s where history is made. Honestly, though…empathy with the  times, without passing subjective moral judgements from our own  prejudices…who cares either way? The only thing I want to understand  about the past is good battle tactics, but I have to live with the fact  that the majority opinion is against me. So I have to read this blasted  book. </em>Kaname bit her lip. <em>Why do I have to study something so  irritating? The Superior and the Etoiles really are cruel about this  stuff. But it makes their kind of sense, doesn’t it? The rich kids can  afford to slide along on barely pass marks because they pay obnoxious  amounts of money, while I have to move heaven and earth, study above my  year-group and consider theoretical concepts normally left to the last  years of school just to enjoy the privilege of continuing here. A  fairer, freer system my ass…</em>Kaname checked her watch and frowned. <em>She’s late. What’s up with her? Kept behind by fangirls?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  read a few more pages, doing her best to concentrate. After a while she  gave up and set the book aside, hugging her knees and closing her eyes  regally. She waited for a few more minutes. <em>Damnit, what’s keeping  her? I told her, didn’t I, that this was important for both of us? I  could care less if people are bothering her, she should just shake them  off and come here. It’s not like I can wait all day. I hope she knows,  and I also hope she knows just how wretchedly hard these exams are.  They’re important. I hope she gets that into her stubborn head. </em>She shook her head, trying to stop thinking. <em>I  hope she hasn’t forgotten or anything stupid like that. If she’s in the  canteen talking to the others or whatever I will be so amazingly  annoyed. Well, I’m not going to fly off and look for her, either. She  can do what she likes, I’ll study anyway, and it’s her loss. Or she  might be with Amane…damnit. Like I said, she can do what she likes. If  spending time with that stuck up bitch really is more important than  studying here with me, who am I to point out that she’s being stupid?  It’s her decision if she wants to be sent straight back to her parents…</em>Kaname  kept a tough expression for a few more seconds, then remembered that  she was alone. She rested her chin on her knees, slumping forwards and  looking at the floor with dull eyes. <em>She’d better not have done  that. That wouldn’t be fair, after everything. I didn’t come this far  just to be outdone by Amane. Or what if she’s afraid to face me? </em>She looked down for a few more moments, then gritted her teeth and threw herself sideways onto the bed again. <em>She  should take responsibility, damnit! Well, it’s not like I care. I’m  sure she’s off somewhere, enjoying a wonderful lunch with Amane, and  she’s welcome to it! I’m fine on my own. I passed these exams on my own  and I lived here on my own, long before she came about, I can live with  it. Her and her bloody new habits, without an ounce of consideration  for me…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door opened and Momomi stepped in, shutting it neatly behind her. “Sorry I’m late.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blinked herself out of her reverie. “Where the hell were you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  went to the canteen to get lunch, and couldn’t find you there. So I  brought lunch for us both. Here.” Momomi hadn’t over two bentos. “I got  you extra as you didn’t eat breakfast. I’m not going to let you get  away with not eating properly, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname took the bentos automatically. “Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you,” Momomi said irritably, waving a finger. “I have a  responsibility, after all. No friend would let you go without food for  a whole day. Now shut up and eat up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “How did you buy this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  worry about that,” Momomi replied theatrically. “It’s fine. Now stop  moping and eat. You won’t be able to study properly if you don’t have  any energy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stared at her, trying to grasp this. She folded her hands on top of the bentos. “So, you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Your hands!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked down. <em>Oh shit.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  she could say anything, Momomi knelt and grabbed her hands, lifting  them closer to her eyes. “I thought so! You’ve been fighting again,  haven’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stared down at her head, blushing furiously. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  obvious, isn’t it? You’ve cracked the knuckles wide open. What the hell  were you trying to do?” Momomi glanced up at her suspiciously. “With  Amane… you didn’t…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That brought everything back. Kaname tore her  hands away and shoved Momomi back. The girl gasped in surprise as she  fell, staring up with shocked eyes. “What’s it to you?” Kaname asked  bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her for a few long moments, then picked herself up and brushed herself off. “Do what you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared back at her, her hands clasped awkwardly. “Right. Remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I’m still not leaving you to bleed.” Momomi grabbed Kaname’s wrist and  dragged the girl upright. She didn’t really have the strength to drag  Kaname anywhere but Kaname didn’t have the will to resist. “Come on.”  She pulled her friend towards the bathroom, not facing her. “You need  to clean the cuts and bind them. We have bandages at least, and I don’t  think this is something we want to trouble the infirmary with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stared at the back of her head. “I’ll be fine…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  hell you will. You’re so irresponsible.” Momomi sounded bitter. “Just  shut up for once and take care of yourself. Only idiots harm  themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname opened her mouth to argue, but found nothing to say. Instead she just shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  placed her bento on the floor and opened their cupboard. “You run those  hands under warm water, okay, at least get them clean. Then dry  yourself off and I’ll bind them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re being fussy, you know.  I’m fine without.” Kaname had intended to complain more fervently than  that, but something about Momomi’s current porcupine demeanour stopped  her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. If it’ll get you off my back.”  Kaname winced slightly as hot water washed over her skin, running red  for a few seconds before clearing. Actually, the lacerations looked a  lot better when they were clear of blood. But they weren’t pretty, all  the same… she dried her hands on a towel, hissing slightly from the  pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned, unwrapping a roll of bandages. “Hold out your hands.” She looked down at the injuries, lips locked in a frown.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right…”  Kaname raised her arms, wincing as Momomi grabbed her right hand and  dressed it in a few deft motions. “You’re surprisingly good at this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s simple enough, isn’t it?” Momomi drew the bandage tight, then started to work on the left hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  wiggled her fingers experimentally, frowning at the gauze swathing her  upper hand. “This restricts my movements rather a lot, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should have thought of that when you did this.” Momomi finished and  tore the remaining roll away, turning away. “You’re reckless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well…” Kaname frowned. <em>Actually, there isn’t anything to yeah, well about. </em>She  rubbed her right hand awkwardly, uncomfortable with the choking  sensation. Her knuckles still hurt, though. She watched uneasily as  Momomi grabbed her lunch and walked out of the bathroom without a word.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname followed, flexing her fingers experimentally. <em>Still  stiff, still hurts. I guess I didn’t even worry about this until she  pointed it out to me, but… yeah. Punching trees is never a good idea.  They only break when you do that in anime. </em>She sat on her bed, glancing unhappily at Momomi, who was facing the wall and eating in silence. <em>Wait…  why is she the one sulking, here? Isn’t she the one in the wrong? I  should be the one mad with her! But… well…right now, I feel like I’m a  bit of a bastard, I suppose. If that was genuine sincere concern, and  not just a ploy, I may have been unkind. To say the least. I wish I  could tell when she’s being serious. But if that’s the case, I also  wish I knew how to make it up to her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She cast around for  inspiration, picking up her first bento and opening it distractedly.  “Well… we should start on the work soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Momomi didn’t bother to look round.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“History  theory today. Something I hate. Perhaps you’ll be better at it.” Kaname  sighed when her friend didn’t reply. “Say… you know, even if I’ve  missed breakfast, too lunchboxes in one sitting is too much. And they  both have pickles in them, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So? You want me to take one back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Not that. I want you to help me finish them. Especially when you brought them in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at her. “That defeats the point. You’re supposed to eat them to make up for before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Which before, I wonder? </em>“Forget that. Just get over here, okay.” Kaname frowned. “It’s a while since we’ve done anything like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only two days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Feels like a lot longer…” Kaname sighed. “Come on, idiot. I don’t like good food going to waste.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can eat the leftovers afterwards.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not the point. You should eat now. Besides, I…” Kaname frowned, trying to phrase her sentiments. “I miss that stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  that’s why you push me away?” Momomi gave her a look that was half  angry and half anguished. “That makes sense, Kaname. You’re just one  huge bundle of contradictions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, just stop sulking and get over here. Then we can get on with our lives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forget it. I’m not in the mood for childish games any more, Kaname.” Momomi glared. “Don’t you get that already?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It stopped being a game a long time ago!” Kaname scowled back. “Or is it more convenient for you to forget that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Screw you. You’re the one who showed me they didn’t mean anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing…  not everything…” Kaname frowned, searching for words again. “Forget it.  Look… I’m sorry. I’m sorry I snapped at you, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her. “Well, that’s original.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Grr! Fine? What do I have to say?” Kaname snorted, standing. “You know what, screw it! I’ll just drag you over here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname strode forwards and grabbed Momomi by the wrist, imitating her friend’s own grip and pulling her to her feet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing? Let me go, damnit!” Momomi stared furiously at the floor, trying to hide a blush. “Stop it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  dragged her across the room and pushed her onto the bed, sitting next  to her. “Damnit, Momomi! I’m not going to let you run away!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not running away from anything!” Momomi sat up and brushed herself off,  glaring. “You’re the one who’s running away here. I know we did some  unusual things in the past, but you have to understand that’s just the  past, nothing else! I was flirting with you since before I knew why,  and you… I don’t know… but I’m over that now. Even if I’m still your  friend, you can’t just pretend nothing’s happened!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname picked  up an umeboshi with her chopsticks. “I’m not that stupid, idiot. But  I’m not letting you sulk or take away all the fun things we did,  either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s easy for you to say, but they were a lot more  than fun to me, and now” Momomi was cut off when Kaname stuck the  pickle in her mouth. “Wha’ was tha’ for?” she mumbled, chewing  furiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think?” Kaname looked down, blushing  herself. “For the hell of it, but whatever. I just don’t like it when  you’re whining.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say I whine? That’s rich!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. <em>Well, she hasn’t run away, and she accepted it too. </em>“Forget it, then.” She picked another fruit and fed it to her friend, watching as the slightly pink lips closed around it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chewed thoughtfully, appearing to relax slightly. “You’re almost bipolar, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah. Well, it’s not like you are-” Kaname was shut up momentarily when  Momomi fed her fish. “There,” she mumbled after she’d swallowed,  looking away again. “Case and point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi picked at her lunch thoughtfully. “How did you hurt your hands?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I tell you that, will you tell me about earlier?” Kaname winced slightly. <em>There. I said it. The thing that’s been between us all day.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, then nodded. “Of course. Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was practising kata on trees, and got carried away.” Kaname glanced at  Momomi’s cynical, worried look, and broke. “Fine. I was working out my  frustrations on trees, and got carried away. That’s how I hurt my  hands. I swear I didn’t get into a fight, not that fighting wouldn’t be  a good idea right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why were you frustrated?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do I even have to reply to that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “So it really did bother you… well, I’ve no idea either. I didn’t expect it and I didn’t like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A lot of girls would kill to be in that position…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not one of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s very beautiful, you know-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?” Momomi sighed. “I don’t care.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, God. Now you sound like her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  isn’t it an important question? If you look at it in terms of  popularity and personality and birth and a lot of things… well, you  know… how do you say it… she’s someone it should be easy to like in  that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, things aren’t that simple. I can’t choose who I  like.” Momomi sighed. “I wouldn’t have fallen for you if I had any say  in the matter. I knew things would end up like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, it’s fine, isn’t it?” Kaname sighed. “I warned you, didn’t I? That she might act like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. I know already.” Momomi shrugged. “It wasn’t a big problem, now was it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wasn’t a big problem? She bloody kissed you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the cheek.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still, she bloody well kissed you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  a platonic way. Sisterly, really.” Momomi closed her eyes. “Don’t you  think? That’s what I think, now that I’ve considered it all in depth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like hell. It didn’t look that way to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it wasn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was not!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi burst out laughing. “Alright, alright. Whatever you say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it didn’t look very platonic to me,” Kaname muttered, looking completely mortified.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you so bothered, anyway?” Momomi smirked. “Jealous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not!” Kaname replied automatically. “Don’t get too full of  yourself. I was just annoyed that you’d go with Amane, of all people,  when she’s a stupid stuck-up… well… oh, fuck it. Fine. I was jealous!  Happy now?” She gave Momomi a defiant look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked slightly surprised at the admission. “You <em>were</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that kinda obvious? What with the injured hands and all?” Kaname sighed. “Forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s just the first time you’ve ever admitted something like that very much.” Momomi frowned. “May I ask why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Now would be a good chance to tell her. Now, how do I phrase this…I have to sort of work up to this…</em>”Well,  it made it obvious that you and Amane might… well…get together. And  that’d mean, for me- well, I’d have less time to spend with you because  you’d always be off with her. And that’d just be annoying, after  everything we’ve been through. Besides, you’re fun to be around. It’s a  normal reaction, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. Well, Amane’s just a friend, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. <em>That’s great news and all, but I kinda avoided the actual point. </em>“Okay.” She forced some severity into her voice. “Just make sure it stays that way!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I probably will. I’d be surprised if I came to like her that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” Kaname closed her eyes. <em>No  guarantees, huh? Well, I know what you have to do, but it’s easier said  than done. Especially for someone like me. Definitely, when I’m so  damned uncertain about everything. I’m nothing like Amane. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “And you need to make sure that you don’t hurt yourself, either. I can’t look after you all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. It’s settled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They ate in silence for a few minutes. Kaname took the chance to surreptitiously examine Momomi. <em>Well,  she’s cute, that’s for sure. We’re pretty close together, like this, it  wouldn’t be hard to reach out and touch her face… as if I’d ever do  something as sappy as that. But her hair’s beautiful and silken. She  wears her clothes well, which is more than I do. Her skin’s so smooth  looking. It’s not something you notice from further away, but like  this, I can really see that. Makes me feel coarse. She is beautiful,  but that’s not the most interesting thing. When she flicks that hair  out of her eyes, that’s interesting. And the smooth way she moved the  chopsticks, taking small bites of food, far more daintily than I ever  could. And the way she kneels casually on my bed as if it’s nothing to  her. Her ever-moving lips, they’re fascinating as well…</em>Kaname met Momomi’s eyes, blushing slightly. <em>Hopefully  I wasn’t caught. But, well, what was I caught doing? I was just  curious, that’s all. I know she’s a beautiful girl, so I just wanted to  find out why. There has to be a reason, after all. But the word curious  is unfortunate in itself, considering its track record as a  euphemism…and she has beautiful eyes, too. They’re very intense and  single-minded. She can see things very clearly, just like me.  Unfortunately, we can both miss the things right in front of our eyes.  This feels like a bad case of that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared back for  a few seconds, then stuck a piece of fish in Kaname’s mouth. “Don’t  think too hard. You’ll probably break something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeh, right…” Kaname mumbled. “It’s all your fault anyway.”</span></p>
