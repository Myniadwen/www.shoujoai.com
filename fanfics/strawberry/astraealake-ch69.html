<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike feels like a plot device, but I think she's necessary. Hopefully she'll develop a bit in what time we have left.</span></p>

“Good  morning, you two.” Shion smiled pleasantly at them. “As ever, you’re  the last to arrive… what is it that holds you up every day?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. <em>She smiles quite a lot, actually. I wonder how many of them are real. </em>“Momomi was slow out of bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Today!  Just for today!” Momomi grumbled, sitting down. “Two nights in three  she’s far lazier than me. It’s strange. It’s like she saves up extra  sleep than blows it every few days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That makes a little more  sense than you,” Kaname. “You go to sleep at a decent time, until such  time as you’re reading a new book… at which point you’ll be up hours  and hours. That’s just plain unhealthy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Books are different.  Books are books.” Momomi spoke authoritatively, as if this would  resolve the matter. “Besides, there’s a lot to be said for reading in  the dead of night…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. It enhances the suspense and fear  factor.” Kaname leaned back, frowning thoughtfully. “But all the same,  you take things too far.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I don’t read horror…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Kenjou-kun does?” Shion inquired. “That suits her image, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki chuckled. “Totally. As for me-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Action thrillers,” Momomi replied. “And Olesa would read very long, heavy sci-fi books. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alicia reads a little romance, too,” Olesa commented indifferently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Olesa!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Though she doesn’t like to talk about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “Why am I not surprised? And you, Shion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Detective novels. That’s obvious, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you, Amane-san?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “Not much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t an encouraged activity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see… but you must have some idea, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not particularly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So basically romance as well,” Kaname remarked. “Considering she’s in denial.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane spared her an annoyed glance. “That isn’t logical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me for that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tapped her finger pointedly against the table. “Yes, yes. But you know, I was just thinking…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Amiki asked. “Oh, the excitement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About  you two.” Momomi leaned forwards, grinning. “The ambience is completely  different. You’d have said ‘ojou-sama’ or nothing, before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,  what? Aren’t people allowed to change now?” Amiki huffed. “You two are  bad examples, aren’t you? You used to bite each other’s throats out on  a regular basis while moping around and getting into fights with us.  Now you’re all lovey-dovey.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.” Momomi shrugged. “Besides, we still argue a lot, don’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More fool you two,” Amiki muttered, folding her arms. “What happened to relationships being harmonious?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The real world came calling,” Kaname replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, that was a compliment,” Momomi said. “Not that you could  recognise one if it sexually assaulted you, of course. You’re a lot  more amiable now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really? Well, you’re still as annoying and whiny as the day we met, you can be assured of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough, Alicia. It isn’t important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s just so annoying, coming from her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, we’ll leave things here, shall we?” Shion asked. “Rivera-chan is very sensitive… as is Kenjou-kun, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey! Why does she get to be a ‘chan’? I’m not the only violent tomboy here!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you really want an answer to that?” Amiki queried, looking amused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It most be strange, though,” Amane began. Everyone looked at her. “When only one person uses your real name, I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  shrugged. “A little. But only a little. Names are supposed to be very  important, but they aren’t really. I’ll answer to either freely now,  and if I wanted a third one, it would be very easy to achieve.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Provided  you have no pride or scruples, of course.” Kaname ate a lump of rice,  chewing it decisively and swallowing. “It suits you very well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, as if you’re a saint. You’d do it if there was ever a reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohtori-san makes an interesting point, though,” Shion said. “What should we call you? We’re used to Amiki, but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just Amiki is fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown haired girl grinned decisively. “Naturally. Only one person’s allowed to call me Alicia. That’s fine, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so.” Shion shrugged easily. “But you’ve all changed by quite a bit. It’s interesting to watch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You talk about it as if it doesn’t concern you,” Kaname noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, does it? As far as I can tell I am the one who has said the same…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.” Momomi folded her arms, grinning. “You have friends now, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  mean. You’re always so unkind to me, that hasn’t changed at all.” Shion  laughed. “In any case, I always had my little birds, you know. You’re  not the end of all things to me, however much you’d like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you gave us that much attention, I’d be slightly scared, to say the  least,” Amiki replied evenly. “But still, Kaname has a point. You’re  not someone who’s stood still while we changed, to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? I’m flattered.” Shion touched her lips thoughtfully. “I think. It’s hard to tell with you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally. We aren’t your cutesy fanclub, after all.” Momomi smirked. “But on this note, how’s Isae getting on?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  She’s still good… though she could be better. She came down with a cold  on Saturday, which annoyed her greatly. She says you should only get  ill on schooldays, that’s only fair.” Shion smiled. “And she’s been  very interested to hear all about you, I can assure you. She thinks  you’re funny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Traitor.” Kaname scowled. “How much did you tell her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm…  well, they used to say that Isae and I were functionally  interchangeable, you know. So I told her everything.” Shion leaned  forwards, pushing up her hair with an idle hand. “I don’t know why  you’re worried, though. She also said you sound very romantic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spy! Infiltrator!” Kaname glared. “That’s just low, to go behind us like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s the problem? Is there anything to be ashamed about?” Shion inquired.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shrugged, catching a deadly glare from the seat next to her. “Of course  not. But still, it’s pretty weird, making it something to talk about…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, this is the kind of gossip Isae’s most interested in,” Shion said. “Her own life is pretty constrained.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, she accepts this stuff?” Amiki asked. “That’s surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  she isn’t someone who can despise anyone… she’s always been that way.”  Shion looked down for a moment. “That hasn’t changed, apparently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that goes for anyone who’s your roommate, right?” Kaname asked, smiling  slightly. “If they can stand your presence at all, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More abuse,” Shion noted, smiling and meeting her eyes. “Sometimes I have no idea why I stick around, I really don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know you like it really,” Olesa replied, as deadpan as ever. But her  lips twitched slightly. “It must make a chance from your fanclub.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s for sure! Those girls have manners and such things none of you  have ever troubled yourselves about.” Shion shook her head in feigned  despair. “I guess I’m still here because I’m hoping against all  evidence that I can improve you all. You need it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “If you say. But if you ask me which of your two groups need more help, it wouldn’t be us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed, shaking her head. “You’re all still strange.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come on, haven’t you got used to it by now?” Kaname asked. “It’s not like you have anything to compare us too, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My lack of attachments now does not preclude attachments in the past, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that, you don’t have the right to tell anyone that they’re strange. Especially not for things like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we get back to teasing Shion now?” Amiki asked sarcastically. “That’s a lot more fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case,” Shion said hastily, “Isae likes to hear about you all. And  she’s very interested in the play, as well.” Shion glanced at them. “On  that note, I need to thank you all for your hard work yesterday. I’m  indebted to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine,” Momomi replied. “You don’t need to thank us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. I just thought I would for once, so don’t get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch…” Momomi sighed theatrically. “You yourself are hardly the best example of traditional good manners, now are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s simple. <em>When in Rome, do as Romans do</em>…  is what they say.” Shion winked. “Particularly appropriate to you. But  I want to feel like I fit in, so I try to be a little abrasive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you have an excuse handy for every occasion.” Amiki leaned back,  closing her eyes. “That’s a characteristic we all share, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where were you two, anyway?” Kaname asked. “Handling the snacks?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  working on the staging, costume, sound and lighting,” Amiki explained.  “It’s a monstrous amount of work, thank you very much. You guys are  just going to take it for granted, of course, but we have to arrange  everything ourselves. It’s not like we have the kind of support the  upper-school play receives, after all. You never know, though. Perhaps  we’ll be able to take their leavings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, at least you don’t  have to deal with all the annoying people,” Kaname replied. “Having to  work and get on with a bunch of people you barely know and don’t  particularly like is annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I pity the people who are  paired with you.” Amiki sniffed. “But we’re hardly at ease, either.  Today we have to talk to people from Lulim… Lulim, for God’s sake! I  don’t know anything about them, except they have a doofy school  uniform! What do we have in common?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lesbianism?” Momomi suggested bluntly. “It seems to be a common trait here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you say that, I’ve heard malicious rumours that Lulim is  heterosexual.” Olesa closed her eyes, again speaking in that annoyingly  diffuse way of hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, that aside, it’s still  difficult.” Amiki closed her eyes. “While you three are slacking off  this evening we have to go with Shion and talk to some Minomoto and a  couple of others she’s dug up from somewhere about costumes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t this supposed to be an all-Spica production?” Kaname asked suspiciously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is just delegation, or sub-contraction, if you will,” Shion explained,  shrugging. “Nothing major. But, to be honest, Lulim dominates at such  things. Those students who elect to go to Spica aren’t generally  interested in mere domestic pastimes, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? So there’s something we aren’t good at?” Kaname asked. “This would be the first time you’ve admitted that, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  But it only makes sense, to go to the best.” Shion closed her eyes. “My  birdies talk to Lulim birdies who all say that this Minomoto-san is  very gifted. I’ve talked to her briefly, and she appears to be someone  we can do business with. Though she is a little eccentric, I must  admit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re hardly one to say that,” Kaname remarked. “Stalker-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I resent that accusation. But at least I’m not into cosplay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s brow wrinkled. “Cosplay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly,” Amiki sighed. “Shion’s right on this one. Surprisingly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion’s brow twitched. “Surprisingly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  groaned. “Well, yet more maniacs. Everyone I met yesterday were pretty  manic as well. One way or the other, in different forms and with  different signs, but still… everyone involved with this bloody play is  mad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think that’s because only an idiot would voluntarily  give up this much time for something that’s only semi-official in the  first place.” Amiki chewed on some egg. “O’course, that goes for both  of us as well. Tells you something, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, our  enthusiasm is good enough, and it’s a chance to meet new people.”  Shion’s lips twitched into an enigmatic smile. “Have any of you made  any friends yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Nagasawa-san was sane, if superior. I  guess she’s not friend material, though.” Momomi rubbed her eyes,  yawning. “And Murai was just way too young and over-enthusiastic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her? Oh, she’s one of my little friends. That’s why she took part, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly, you don’t patronise them much, now do you?” Kaname closed her eyes. “It gets bloody annoying after a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  only because I like them,” Shion explained. “Diminutisation is a habit  of mine. Rather like me talking you Kenjou-kun, Kenjou-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, that’s annoying too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  It’s hilarious.” Amiki lowered her chopsticks and checked her watch,  then leaned back on in her seat. “You’re just over-defensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  glad you agree, Rivera-chan.” Shion looked across the room, narrowly  avoiding the Kenjou Death Glare. “But I’m fond of Murai. She is a very  enthusiastic girl, with a commendable girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No doubt you’ll  have the pleasure of watching that youthful innocence slowly shredded  as the years pass.” Olesa flicked a hair off her brilliant white  blazer. “That’s why I try not to take an interest in such things,  really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s cynical… and this is <em>me </em>saying that.” Kaname rubbed her forehead irritably. “That’s cast-iron proof that this world is going mad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Going mad?” Amiki asked. “I wish I could be so sanguine. It’s been that way ever since we met.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  see about that, though. If everything goes well for her, nothing so  dramatic will occur.” Shion glanced at them. “Of course, I’m expecting  you to work hard as responsible senpais to prevent such nasty things,  no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname put her chopsticks aside, then stuck her hands in her pockets. “Don’t look at me. Isn’t that your job?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.  We’re still young and busy ourselves, we don’t have that kind of time,  you know.” Momomi folded her arms. “Especially me, as I’m relatively  new to this school myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good attitudes. I’m glad you aren’t the kind of people we cite to prove that the room helper system is unnecessary…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  thing is, of course, that we’re normal Spicans.” Amiki smirked. “The  kind of people who join because they despise the idea of room helpers.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  rested her head on her hands, sighing. “There’s probably a grain of  truth in that, of course, which makes me sad. Well, Miator’s traditions  in general and that one in particular <em>are</em> completely outdated…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it possible to transfer schools?” Olesa mused. “Joining Miator in third year would be optimal, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you need a very, very good reason before that happens,” Shion observed. “Thank god.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s too bad. I wouldn’t mind having a girl to my chores for me, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t you have Ami…” Kaname grinned, “Alicia-chan for that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You want to die?” Amiki asked seriously. “Listening to you molest my birth name with your tongue is extremely painful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that wasn’t sexual at all…” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By  and large, I have more important things for Amiki to do than common  cleaning.” Olesa shrugged. “Homework. Gaming. And other pastimes of  that kind. That’s obvious, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so… at which  point, I have to wonder why she’s a servant.” Kaname rolled her eyes.  “Well, far be it from a mere commoner to question the ways of the Perez  family, I’m sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It works, so that’s enough,” Amiki explained.  “Traditions should be adapted to a modern world, after all. That’s the  purpose of this conversation, because Miator doesn’t do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we’ll eagerly await the day when roommates become video-game partners,”  Shion replied, smiling. “They could become the new Lulim that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure you’ll be encouraging them to do that soon,” Kaname observed. “It’s your idea of sabotage, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please.  I wouldn’t do something so uncivilised. It’s more fun if I have a  decent opponent, after all. And however you look at it, Lulim aren’t  opposition material. I’m quite like you in that respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?” Kaname asked defensively. “You sure say some unnecessary things…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san,” Amane murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown-haired girl jumped. “Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was wondering what you were looking at.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared at her rival, before glancing at Momomi. She did look a little distracted. <em>It’s certainly annoying if Amane, of all people beats me to it. </em>“Are you alright?” she asked roughly. “Spacing out like that is bad for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  nothing,” Momomi replied, glancing at them and smiling slightly.  “There’s no need to be too dramatic about things, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  pay attention, if there’s nothing wrong,” Kaname complained. “It’s not  encouraging if we’re so boring that you can’t be bothered to even  pretend to listen to us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you’re just too sensitive. But I was just thinking about that girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s brow wrinkled as she looked around. “That girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Asayo Koike-san,” Amane said blandly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  her. She’s a strange one.” Momomi shrugged. “Well, it looks like she’s  with friends now, so I don’t have to worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“From what I know of her, there’s no reason for you to concern yourself with her,” Kaname said. “She’s a pretty annoying girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.  Well, we appear in more than a few scenes together, that’s all.” Momomi  glanced at the other three. “Do you know anything about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki shrugged. “She’s not a fangirl or ditz… but the other kind of girl who attends here. Our kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But she doesn’t bother us so we don’t bother her,” Olesa observed. “That’s all. For you, too, that should be sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Momomi replied. “How about you, Shion? Anything I should know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  shrugged. “I know rather more than I consider it reasonable to say.  This school has a lot of secrets, and I’m good at digging them up. No,  Amane-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted. “That’s mean. Spill the dirt, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you so interested? She’s just another girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  another very annoying girl. It only makes sense, doesn’t it?” Momomi  sighed. “They always seem t get involved with me in the end…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  chuckled. “Well, there’s no danger of that. Beyond her narrow circle,  Koike-san isn’t particularly forceful. She’s someone who could well be  known as Spica’s ice princess, for various reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After  Amane’s nickname?” Kaname sighed. “The people in this school need to be  more inventive, seriously. Just as long as she doesn’t bother me,  though, whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s talented, though. Koike is someone,  alongside you four, who I consider worth my time. I hope you don’t  consider yourselves unique in that respect.” Shion closed her eyes and  shrugged, smiling wanly. “Of course, Koike-san doesn’t consider me  worth her time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So why is she the play, then?” Momomi inquired. “Isn’t that a bother for her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  knows? I’m hardly a friend of hers, Kiyashiki-san.” She opened one eye.  “But Kenjou-kun is right. It isn’t an important matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Momomi scratched her forehead. “I was just curious, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what you said the first time you confessed to Kaname, and look where it got you,” Amiki teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is she bothering you, though?” Kaname demanded. “If she is, I’ll tell her to stop. Bitches like that need a lot of warning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“People  like me, you mean?” Momomi shrugged. “But they’re right. It isn’t an  important matter, just something of curiosity. Let’s leave it at that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  on that note, we don’t have very much time.” Shion checked her watch.  “We’d better get to our lessons. They won’t stop for our convenience,  sadly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stood, shouldering her bag. “Let’s go, Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown-haired girl nodded, standing herself. But her gaze wandered to Koike as the girl walked out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thanks in large part to that, Kaname spent the next few lessons in a dark mood. <em>I’m  beginning to suspect that she’s going off again. I wouldn’t expect it  from someone like Momomi, but I’ve worked it out by now. Momomi regards  most decent people as pests and the unfriendly and unpleasant kind  fascinating challenges…Olesa, Amane and even myself were probably all  something like that to her, in the past. Probably her kind of egoism.  She likes to regard herself as different, someone who can reach the  sort of person that others can’t, through a combination of perception,  patience and bloody-minded persistence. And who am I to call her wrong  when she thinks that? It worked on Amane to some degree, on Olesa  considerably more, and possibly on me. Though as far as I’m concerned,  I didn’t just sit there and let her do all the moving, unlike those  two. I have my pride, of course. But still, some people enjoy adopting  little lost puppies or broken birds and nursing them back to health.  Momomi is the only person I’ve ever known who really gets a kick out of  cautiously approaching rabid animals with a long stick in one hand and  a bone in the other. </em>Kaname rubbed her eyes tiredly. <em>Maybe I  shouldn’t have got up so early after all. But still, I’m not sure  whether to be glad or annoyed by her sudden interest, if that is what  is going on. On one hand, the novelty might drag her away from Amane,  at least, which would suit me just fine. On the other, she may simply  spend more time on her snake charming, and if she’s going to make a  habit of this we’ll soon have problems. As always, she does superfluous  things and leaves me wondering how to fix it. At least my feud with  Amane is simple and clean. </em>She looked cautiously across the classroom at a girl she’d never bothered to notice before. <em>So  I guess I should stop it, somehow. But I can’t just tell Momomi.  That’ll only make her obstinate. I guess I’ll have to go straight to  the source…and besides, this is another matter of pride. However you  look at it, Momomi and Shion have better awareness of the people around  them than I do. Which is just embarrassing, considering Momomi is the  transfer student. Amiki and Olesa too. Being the one with the facts for  once could be fun. </em>Kaname smirked. <em>Of course, my methods may be  a little simpler than theirs are. But that’s all to the good. I’ve got  no patience with complicated things.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So when the morning lessons finally ended she walked forwards and stopped in front of the girl’s desk. “Asayo Koike, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right. Shouldn’t you know, Kenjou? We’ve only been in the same class  for a year and a half.” Koike’s lips curled into a smile. “Of course,  for someone like you, any length of time makes no difference at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yeah. I don’t like her, not at all. </em>Kaname scowled. “Come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Koike giggled. “Inviting me out on a date, is it? I would, Kenjou, but  I can’t let you betray Kiyashiki-san. Or should that be Phareli-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But she doesn’t want me to like her, that’s the point. So I’ll bear with it, if only to spite her. </em>“You’re noisy. Just come.” <em>Well… mostly.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho  glanced between them, looking puzzled. “What are you doing, Kenjou? If  you think I’ll let you do whatever you like with her-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine, Yuho,” Koike replied confidently. “Just a talk, is it, Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then that’s fine. I’ll catch up with you guys, later.” Koike waved. “After all, how could I resist such a polite invitation?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yuho glared, plainly unhappy, then shrugged. “Whatever. Just watch out. She is the violent hooligan, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just snorted, turning on her heels. “Hurry it up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  coming,” Koike replied cheerfully. She was silent for a while, until  they’d moved away from most people along the corridors, then she spoke  again. “Well, this is exciting, isn’t it? The introvert Kenjou talking  to innocent me? I’m flattered, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be.” Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets, already regretting her impulsive decision. <em>Shion and Momomi make this crap look so easy. Well, it isn’t hard, but it is a bother. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  what’s up? Lose a bet with Kiyashiki? Or did Tomori-senpai put you up  to this?” Koike shook her head. “But Tomori-senpai would send  Kiyashiki-san or Rivera-san, if it was her. They’re more eloquent than  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sue take a great interest in us, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  are people, and then there are people who watch people, but who watches  the watchers?” Koike smirked. “The answer is me. But I’ve had a  particular reason to watch you all in recent times. In any case, send  Tomori-senpai my compliments. But if she was the one, tell her not to  bother.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So I’m a pawn, now?” Kaname inquired irritably. “I’m  afraid to say that I’m nothing so easy to fit into your world-view.  You’re not important enough for anything so organised to occur.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, obviously I’m important to someone, aren’t I?” Koike chuckled. “You’re talking to me, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m flattered you think I flatter you so much merely by talking to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it makes you overcome your antisocial tendencies, it must be important.  But don’t tell me yet, I haven’t finished guessing.” Koike closed her  eyes for a moment, then opened them, smiling arrogantly. “Amane-chan,  perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you really think I’d take orders from her?” Kaname  snorted. “Don’t joke around. Besides, do you think she’d even notice  and care about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m a little better off in that  respect than you are.” Koike smirked. “Of course, I’m not her rival. I  was surprised, though, when I found just who it was who managed to get  to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. You’re still talking fantasy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if it really was Amane-chan, it would probably be Kiyashiki-san who  would put you up to it.” Koike shrugged as they stepped out into the  open. “But I’ve played a guessing game for long enough, haven’t I? If  you’re the one to call me out, shouldn’t you do most of the talking?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’d shut up for a few seconds, I’ll begin.” Kaname glared at her. “You’re obnoxiously talkative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really?” Koike smiled as if that had been high praise. “You seemed  awkward, Kenjou, so I thought I’d break the ice and put you at your  ease. Apparently I succeeded.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname fumed silently for a moment, before collecting herself again. <em>That’s what she wants. </em>“Well,  what I actually have to say is simple and to the point. If you bother  Momomi, I’ll make you suffer for that. At that damn play or anywhere  else, I expect you to civil. I hear you weren’t yesterday.” That was a  bluff, of course, but a good one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. It does appear that  Kiyashiki-san is overstating the situation,” Koike mused. “And your  over-protective boyfriend act is very cute. But I don’t think I take  orders from you, so I’m sure I’ll treat her just as I please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Well, she hardly needs protection. But it’s something I intend to say anyway. I certainly don’t trust you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if it came to physical conflict, you’d definitely have the conflict,”  Koike continued thoughtfully. “Unless I had my bow to hand, but that’s  slightly illegal. Of course, I could then get you in significant  trouble. But provided it’s not an expulsion offence, you probably won’t  care, and I’ll still be in pain. That’s your logic, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  it comes to that, yes. But isn’t it obvious that it shouldn’t?” Kaname  folded her eyes, looking down at the other girl. “If you have to talk  to her, cut out your smart-ass crap. Otherwise stay away from her. What  do you lose?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s the principle of the thing, isn’t it, Kenjou?  I’m sure you understand that.” Koike glanced back at her. “Now that  you’ve challenged me like this, I don’t have any choice but to bother  Kiyashiki-san as much possible. Do you really think I’d take orders  from you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. But I can provide useful advice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Well, I’m not convinced. So what have you gained from this exchange?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fair warning,” Kaname grunted. “If you annoy her now, I won’t need any kind of prelude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow. Surprisingly honourable, Kenjou. I thought you’d bash my brains out from behind with your bokken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m always straight-forwards. You’re the sneaky one.” Kaname folded her arms, walking away. “But I’ve warned you. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, Kenjou, is this really alright?” Koike asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stopped and turned her head. “What are you muttering about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  if you’re going to be overprotective… not that I understand why you’d  want to protect her, but that’s not the point…” Koike shook out her  hair slightly, smiling and looking up assertively. “Shouldn’t you begin  with Amane-chan? Isn’t she the bigger problem here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not your business,” Kaname muttered stiffly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you’ve sorta made it my business, to talk to me like this all of a  sudden.” Koike smirked. “Something like that? But however I look at it,  I’m not the problem here. You can keep Kiyashiki-san. But Amane-chan  thinks differently.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-chan, is it?” Kaname snorted. “Don’t you people normally call her ‘sama’?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  actually, we’re not creeps. But she’s Amane-chan to me, though I’m more  polite to her face. I have my reasons. You have a really casual  attitude, though, Kenjou. Isn’t she the girl who beat you at  everything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if you aren’t way beneath me in that same everything,” Kaname replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  got nothing to do with it. It’s Amane who is your rival, and she’s  definitely more outstanding.” Koike closed her eyes. “In terms of  birth, money, manners and upbringing alone, isn’t she far more suited  to the Phareli child? Compared to a penniless commoner like you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if Momomi cares about that crap. She doesn’t have time for any of that family tradition nonsense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?  How romantic. But I wonder how long such a teenage rebellion will  last.” Koike put a hand on her hip, cocking her head. “How serious are  you about Kiyashiki-san, Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname flushed, turning away. <em>Just walk away. You don’t have to listen to this. No, it would be stupid to listen to this. </em>“What are you getting at?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  I’m just wondering. But certainly, rebellion is fine now, within the  comfort of Astraea… there’s no impact on her life.” Koike closed her  eyes. “But when she grows up, what then? What happens when she realises  she won’t be able to live in the manner she’s become accustomed to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  appear to mistake Momomi for someone like you,” Kaname snapped. “She’s  a lot stronger than that. She knows what she’s choosing, and she’ll see  it through. That’s who she is, not that you’d know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, a  touching lover’s faith.” Koike chuckled. “But I think you’re the  deluded one here. We’ve seen it before, deviant children running back  to the nest when they realise love won’t help them survive in real life  at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And some of them make it, too. If you deny that, you’d  the stupid one.” Kaname glared. “Momomi will go as far as she needs to.  Besides, deviant? That kind of language is just beyond pathetic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  really? Well, the truth hurts… especially in a place like this, with a  pretence of faith…” Koike laughed out loud. “Okay, even for me that’s  too much. You’re right, of course, but it isn’t the point. Sentiment  and pride alone won’t sustain anyone. Kiyashiki-san may make it or  cave, but that isn’t the point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I should walk away. </em>“She’ll  make it. That’s something you wouldn’t know about it.” Kaname glared.  “I’m the only one here who knows what real life is like, after all. And  she’s strong enough for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Is that so?” Koike asked  politely. “Thanks for a thirteen year-old’s partisan view. But it isn’t  the point. From her perspective, she can suffer and struggle with a  life like that, or someone can deliver her into the lap of luxury like  Amane-chan. So what does she gain?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What does Amane have to do with it? As if her parents would let it be…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  no. Actually, the Ohtori family has by and large given up on her, so  she has a larger than usual amount of autonomy without power. She isn’t  in serious consideration for high positions.” Koike smirked. “Only a  family like the Ohtori could dismiss someone so talented so easily, but  that’s how it is. She’s better placed than most.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Better placed  to be auctioned off. Besides, it’s also something a lot simpler than  your theory.” Kaname stepped forwards. “She doesn’t like Amane. Though  no doubt you left that out of your theoretical calculations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m talking in hypothetical terms, after all.” Koike shrugged. “You’re  only a young, so the odds of your relationship holding out that long  are zero. But it’s nice to talk about, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said this before, but you talk way too much. Especially when you end up changing your point completely…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly.  My point still stands. If it was for me, at least, I would definitely  feel more threatened by Amane-chan. She’s like you, but with genuine  blue blood and also- dare I say it- less rough edges.” Koike chuckled.  “Well, I can only speak for myself, Kenjou, but I’d sooner fall for  her, not you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said, your theories are very cute. But  that’s all they are, theories.” Kaname folded her arms. “I’m the one  Momomi likes. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Such boldness, to be talking about a  fickle teenage love.” Koike shrugged. “Well, it’s your choice. But  while you’re talking here, doesn’t it worry you that they’re riding out  there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “I trust Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again, that’s  touching. I’m glad to hear it.” Koike glanced sideways at Kaname. “But  that doesn’t mean it feels good, now does it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course it doesn’t bother me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  Well, that’s fine.” Koike turned away, looking out over the forest.  “But still, it’s an annoying situation, isn’t it? Momomi stands between  the two of you, even though you hate each other. You like Kiyashiki,  Kiyashiki likes you, and don’t you think that Amane-chan likes your  precious Momomi as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She doesn’t stand a chance. So she can feel what she likes, whatever she feels.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you don’t disagree with me on that. But it’s still true. This halfway  has to be very unsatisfactory for you. Shouldn’t Kiyashiki-san take  your feelings into consideration a little more? You’re her girlfriend,  after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I supposed to take you seriously?” Kaname asked acidly. “This time yesterday, after all, I could barely remember your name.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More  fool you. But this situation doesn’t advantage you at all, however I  look at it. Your important Kiyashiki-san spends so much time with  Amane-chan, and more to the point, Amane has chance after chance to  work on Momomi. You say you trust her, but time changes everything, and  can you really be naïve enough to say these things last forever? What  if you have an argument? Won’t she come crying to Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not that paranoid, jealous or pathetic,” Kaname retorted. “Unlike you,  I know Momomi has rights. She can be friends with whoever she likes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  maturity card from you? Amusing. But what do you gain, Kenjou?” Koike  turned, smiling. “Nothing. So shouldn’t you tear it all down? A  decisive contest between you and Amane, with Kiyashiki-san as the  prize. Isn’t that a fight you should win?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Get real. I have better things to do.” Kaname turned on her heel, walking back towards the school as the bell rang.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  Well, that’s fine, but if you ever want to take Amane-chan on…” Koike  smiled as Kaname looked back. “I’ll back you up, Kenjou. And I know  quite a lot about Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why would I trust you to help me, even  if I was interested?” Kaname snorted. “Don’t screw with me. I’m not  that easy to manipulate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there’s one good reason.” Koike raised a finger happily. “I like Amane-chan.”</span></p>
