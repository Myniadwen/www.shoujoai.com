<pre>Threads of fate...

The sun shined brightly at Lillian University that late summer morning. 
Nanto Yaya looked up to the sky where a clear rainbow made itself 
visible on the almost clear morning sky, a small mark of the slightly 
heavy rain the night before. It was her second year as a college student 
and she just glad that she was somehow able to readjust to life in Japan 
and being in a catholic and girl&#39;s school once again.

&quot;I feel like it&#39;s going to be a good day.&quot; She said to herself with a 
soft smile on her face. Placing a finger under her collar to fix the odd 
itching sensation the new red shirt, that she had bought a few days ago, 
was giving her. Over it she wore a slightly frilly black blouse that 
seemed one size too small for one part of her body, light blue denim 
jeans that had few intentional incisions here and there, and a black 
mini skirt that was as frilly as her blouse.

&quot;Yaya-chan!&quot; a familiar voice called out to her. The raven haired girl 
quickly turns around and saw her blonde, former occasional classmate, 
senpai and friend Satou Sei.

&quot;Ah! Sei-senpai, Good Morning.&quot; She tried not to let her face show what 
she thought, she noted that the tall blonde girl&#39;s taste in clothes was 
severely lacking today, she had to try quite hard not to stare at the 
very wrinkled camouflage shirt and cargo pants. It was a rare sight for 
her to be wearing such clothes. She recalls asking her about it once but 
never really understood her answer, for now she&#39;d like to think that she 
her senpai just has trouble living a dorm life and sometimes doesn&#39;t 
have time to wash all her good clothes. That or she&#39;s just really as 
laid back as she looks.

&quot;You look cheerful today. Did something happen during vacation?&quot; she 
gave the raven haired girl an amused yet accusing look.

&quot;I&#39;m always at awe at how you can tell my mood, senpai.&quot; Yaya couldn&#39;t 
help but blush at her senpai&#39;s gaze, something that started the very day 
she met Sei. She wasn&#39;t the type that blushed easily; she was the strong 
type... the ones that didn&#39;t need others. But this girl had proven 
otherwise, with her flirtatiousness and overly touchy habits. And though 
she knew it was never a real thing, meeting her was one of the things 
that distracted and helped her get over her heartaches... something that 
even moving to America for almost three years couldn&#39;t accomplish. Of 
course she&#39;d never admit that to her out loud.

&quot;You didn&#39;t answer my question.&quot; Sei stated in a familiar and almost 
arousing tone, that Yaya was just glad she had gotten used to.

The raven haired sighed softly in defeat and said; &quot;I just have a 
feeling something good is going to happen today.&quot; Yaya looked at her 
senpai, with a genuine and soft smile that hasn&#39;t adorn her lips for 
over four years.

&quot;Oh! Something like this?!&quot; Sei immediately stepped forward and wrapped 
her arms around Yaya, completely closing any gap and chance for escape 
for the raven haired girl to escape.

But naturally anyone&#39;s reaction to being hugged suddenly is to push away 
who ever it was holding them. &quot;Wait a minute! Let go of me senpai!!!&quot; 
Yaya tried to push not really knowing or caring at first what part of 
her senpai she was touching.

&quot;Ah! You&#39;re so bold Yaya-chan! Touching my breasts in public and in 
broad daylight!&quot; Sei yelled out jestingly.

&quot;WAH?!&quot; Yaya in surprise and embarrassment did not bother to check if 
she was in fact touching Sei&#39;s breasts and immediately withdrew her 
hands and drops them down, completely losing her guard.

She is then once again locked in the tall blonde&#39;s embrace who seemed 
more than happy about something. &quot;Just kidding! You were actually 
touching my stomach!&quot;

&quot;Senpai...&quot; Yaya growled in an annoyed tone, her face turned bright red 
in fury and humiliation.

&quot;Ah! Yaya-chan, did you loose weight?&quot; Sei muttered out loud as she 
gently groped and felt the soft curves of Yaya&#39;s buttom. It took her a 
few moments to stop, forget what she was doing and look down to meet the 
face of her favorite kouhai and see that the look on the raven haired 
girl&#39;s face was almost enough to silence her. &quot;Yaya... -chan?&quot;

&quot;I will kill you...&quot; there it was... Yaya&#39;s death threat, backed up by a 
powerful killing intent that can probably cause any wild animal to cower 
in fear. Although Sei was well aware that it was an empty threat, 
despite the aura of death, to her it was a sign to stop. It was their 
unspoken rule that if and when the raven haired girl says it all teasing 
must end because it was no longer the least bit amusing for Yaya. And 
although the tall short haired blonde senpai wanted to do more to her 
favorite kouhai, the very same one she had missed teasing for over a 
week, she decided to stop and behave as it seems that her favorite 
kouhai wasn&#39;t in a very tolerating mood.

Sei immediately letting go of Yaya and instantly focuses on cooling down 
the raven hair&#39;s fury. &quot;Now... Now... I&#39;m sorry. Please forgive me. 
Don&#39;t kill me.&quot; She said as she tried to lower herself and keep her head 
at Yaya&#39;s level or lower. She also clasped her hands in a way that 
screamed &#39;begging for mercy...&#39; but it was clear to anyone, from just 
the look on her face that she does not mean it.

But Yaya cooled down... used to the insincere act of apologizing that 
had probably been Satou Sei&#39;s signature, and Yaya would probably believe 
her if she said it&#39;s copyrighted and patented. She lets out a sigh 
letting out any of the anger that she still had in her chest and calming 
herself after a couple of deep breaths before turning her attention once 
more to her senpai. &quot;You really know how to make and ruin my day don&#39;t 
you Sei-senpai...&quot; she muttered in an almost aggressive tone.

The blonde responded by sheepishly smiling and scratching her head. 
&quot;Hehe... sorry about that...&quot; then laughing at herself then added; &quot;I 
just missed you so much...&quot; which sounded more sincere than her apology.

Yaya lets out another sigh that released the last of her rage. But oddly 
enough... if Yaya looked back, the only time that she ever gets mad is 
with and is at Sei. Yaya couldn&#39;t ever get mad at anyone else, at least 
not since she started lying to herself five years ago. Not even at her 
annoying Spican kouhai, Tsubomi, way back then. She didn&#39;t know why, or 
how... but Sei opens her heart and places in all kinds of emotions. 
Although she never once felt love for her tall blonde haired senpai and 
neither has her senpai seriously considered or shown her that she had 
feelings for her. Which sometimes made her wonder... was Sei acting like 
she did with Hikari over four years ago?

The raven haired girl decided to just end the issue there before it gets 
confusing... she wasn&#39;t ready and maybe deep inside she&#39;ll never be. She 
turned away from her senpai and began walking towards the building after 
taking out her schedule card.

As she walked away she heard her senpai yell out; &quot;Yaya-chan! Lunch as 
usual ok?!&quot; Their usual lunch would mean that Sei was to pick her up in 
her classroom.

Yaya, without looking, answers her by waving her hand with her palm 
facing her senpai. A simple sign that Sei had came up with to be used 
between their circle of friends that meant; &quot;Yes.&quot; And though she was 
still a little angry her mind began to ease up at the knowledge that Sei 
only invites her for lunch when she has money... needless to say, it was 
the blonde girl&#39;s treat later that day.

In the ground floor of the west wing, Konohana Hikari sat on a random 
desk at the back close to a window. It wasn&#39;t her seat yet, maybe 
tomorrow someone will decide to take a seat there before she arrives, 
but that&#39;s not really a problem and was well known part of college life. 
She glanced at her schedule card before she looked at the board once 
more, where the room&#39;s number was painted on the board&#39;s corners, and 
was relieved to know that she was the right person, in the right time, 
in the right room.

She could never get rid of most of her nervous side even after five 
years. Her shyness began to fade a few months after the time her best 
friend had left without a word to her... one spring morning. She missed 
her room mate and best friend greatly. She had spent almost a month in 
her room crying and sulking; only leaving it for class, food and her 
Etoile duties that didn&#39;t require her to be displayed to the public. She 
sent Yaya tons of letters, she tried calling her, but each time the maid 
or butler would say that Yaya wasn&#39;t home nor was anyone that knew where 
she was. And in the end... she never got a reply.

That is until two months after Yaya had left... One letter came. It 
didn&#39;t have an address, a stamp, or said who it was from. The only thing 
written on the envelope was;

&quot;Hikari...&quot;

Inside held the letter she now treasures, now hidden in her secret box 
that was somewhere in her dorm room close by to the campus. That letter 
contained the most baffling yet painfully written words that she&#39;s ever 
read in her life;

&quot;Forgive me... Good bye...&quot;

&quot;...Yaya&quot;

Those words made her cry when she had thought her tears had long run out 
after the girl had left. And although it seemed that it was Yaya who was 
asking for forgiveness... she couldn&#39;t help but feel she had done 
something to chase her best friend away. She would loose herself in 
thought for hours and hours; thinking of what it was that Yaya might 
have ever done that would need her to ask for forgiveness. And even 
after she had scanned her whole memory, there was nothing she could 
remember that made her even the slightest bit angry at her very first 
best friend. Since then she wished that she could meet her again and ask 
her about it.

As she reminisced on those lonely memories the room slowly began to fill 
up with students some deeply sighing as the summer break was over, some 
others like her sat alone feeling new to the environment of the 
university and some happily chatting as friends who seemed awfully 
close. Hikari wondered if Yaya didn&#39;t suddenly leave, would they be as 
close they were? Would Yaya have been in her previous college and move 
here at Lillian University with her? Could their bond have deepen 
more?... but sadly she will never know the answers to those as the time 
for those questions to happen have long passed.

Ootori Amane, Former Spican Etoile, and Hikari&#39;s first love had been 
more than accommodating until her last years at St. Spica. In Yaya&#39;s 
place, she took good care of Hikari. And as soon as Hikari had gotten 
over the shock of Yaya&#39;s sudden departure, made her very happy. But 
Hikari would still cry... occasionally, time and time again, she would 
miss her best friend especially when Amane is not there to make her feel 
better.

&quot;Yaya-san! Good Morning!&quot; At the call of that name, the blonde girl 
couldn&#39;t help but look over to the source of the call. Her eyes found 
themselves looking towards the room&#39;s front door where a few girls 
stood, seemingly waiting for someone to arrive.

&#39;I heard them right didn&#39;t I? They said Yaya-san... right?&#39; she asked 
herself. But at the same time she felt an odd sense of doubt... that it 
was probably someone with the same name, Yaya was a rare name but it&#39;s 
not completely impossible for her to meet someone else with the same 
name. She looked on and waited for whom the girls greeted.

But before she clearly could see who it was... she heard the 
unmistakable voice of her high school best friend.

&quot;Hi Everyone! Good Morning!&quot; Yaya said in English with the ever popular 
American accent. It was quite wide spread among her former classmates 
that she had just moved back from America after finishing high school 
almost a year and a half ago. And a lot of them have always turned to 
her for help polishing their English.

&#39;Yaya-chan?!&#39; Hikari looked at the crowd more hoping she would catch a 
glimpse of her soon. There were quite a few girls making a fuss at the 
door blocking the blonde girl&#39;s view. But even if she did see the girl 
what would she say to her? Can she just run up to her, wrap her arms 
around her, calling out her name out loud and say that she missed her 
these four and a half years? Will she recognize her? Or the possibility 
that she fears the most is... what if Yaya doesn&#39;t even remember her?

The professor suddenly arrived, greeted everyone and asked them all to 
take a seat before starting to introduce herself. Meanwhile in Hikari&#39;s 
deep thought she failed to catch a glimpse of the girl they called Yaya 
and confirm if it was in fact the same girl. She looked around the room 
but there were a quite a few long dark haired girls that she didn&#39;t know 
how to tell them a part from behind. It wouldn&#39;t have been a problem 
back in their high school days... the color, length and wave of her hair 
was long imprinted into her mind. But it was different now... and for 
all she knew Yaya could have cut her hair short or started tying her 
hair in odd ways.

&quot;Alright everyone! I&#39;d like to get to know you a little before we 
start.&quot; The professor then looked at the seat at the front corner of the 
room before gesturing the girl on the seat to stand and introduce 
herself.

Yaya stands and turns to face her classmates. &quot;Nanto, Yaya...&quot; she 
introduced herself in a calm and almost cold tone, before adding; 
&quot;...all other information about me are classified so please don&#39;t ask!&quot; 
in a light and comedic way causing almost everyone she knew and some 
that she didn&#39;t to laugh.

Hikari at the back was stunned... It was indeed Yaya, her high school 
best friend Yaya. She didn&#39;t know why but she felt angry when the raven 
haired girl sat back down on her seat. Did she not see her?

While the next students take their turn, Hikari thinks about more about 
what just happened. &#39;That girl is Yaya?!&#39; she screamed at herself in her 
mind. &#39;That tall, beauty in black... is Yaya?!&#39; Hikari rubbed her eyes 
once or twice before looking again, in complete doubt and shock.

Curious as to Hikari&#39;s reactions the girl beside her asked; &quot;Is 
something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Eh?!&quot; Hikari blurted randomly as she looked to her side and replied; 
&quot;No... nothing...&quot; before looking towards Yaya&#39;s direction, still in 
doubting and surprised.

&quot;Love at first sight?...&quot; the girl asked, to simply tease the blonde 
girl to start a conversation, not bothering to consider how the girl 
will react.

&quot;WAAAAH?!&quot; Hikari yelled out as she suddenly stood in surprise and 
embarrassment causing her chair to fall down behind her with a loud 
wooden crash. This caused quite a few heads to turn, including Yaya&#39;s.

&quot;You! At the back!&quot; yelled the professor as she pointed her pen at 
Hikari. &quot;Since you seem so eager why don&#39;t you introduce yourself now!&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; Hikari still blushing and even more embarrassed than she was 
stood and bowed apologetically to the professor. She then stood at an 
angle that faced most of her classmates but more importantly she was 
facing Yaya, who had sat in a way that she could see the girl without 
straining her neck. Hikari couldn&#39;t help but feel annoyed that Yaya&#39;s 
face showed no signs of recognizing her. &quot;I&#39;m Konohana, Hikari...&quot;

Before Hikari could continue to say anything else, she was surprised to 
see Yaya panic and very loudly turned her bag inside out which spilled 
all her things on her desk and catching the attention of everyone else 
in the room. She then sifted through her belongings and picked up a 
plastic case, inside it was a pair of glasses which she immediately put 
on before looking towards Hikari again. This immediately caused Hikari&#39;s 
hidden agitation towards Yaya to disappear, thinking that it couldn&#39;t be 
helped that Yaya didn&#39;t recognize her if her eye sight was bad now.

Yaya&#39;s eyes weren&#39;t so bad, but it was enough that she couldn&#39;t see the 
faces of her classmates about three to four desks away. She could read 
the board but had to wear her glasses if she needed to read her text 
book or write a note. As Yaya&#39;s eyes slowly began to focus on the 
standing blonde girl, everyone else was in a state of surprise and 
wonder as they looked back and forth the two girls holding an unspoken 
unanimous decision to stay quiet and just watch.

The raven haired girl knew that the girl standing was blonde and 
probably a little bit shorter than she was. Time seemed to have slowed 
for her as her eyes slowly focused and recognized her petite frame. Her 
heart raced faster and faster, anticipation was suffocating her. As her 
amber orbs slowly traced the soft waves of the blonde&#39;s lightly curled 
hair she swallowed an anxious gulp of her own saliva. And when her eyes 
finally gazed upon her face and met her blue eyes... Yaya gasped, held 
up her hands to cover the completely shocked and confused expression on 
her face.

&quot;Hikari?&quot; Yaya, still in disbelief, tentatively mumbled audibly enough 
to be heard at the back of the room in thanks to the silence of their 
classmates.

Hikari smiled at her brightly and said in a soft happy voice; &quot;It&#39;s been 
a while... Yaya-chan.&quot;

&#39;It&#39;s really Hikari!&#39; Yaya screamed inside and yet she looked absolutely 
stunned outside. She never thought that she would ever meet Hikari 
again. The wish to talk to her, to see her again or even the thought to 
wish that had been completely buried deep in the recesses of her mind by 
her subconscious. By some odd stroke of fate she meets her again and she 
does not have a clue of what to do.

The blonde girl grew worried by the second as Yaya had not blinked or 
moved. She took a step forward and walked over to the girl. Everyone 
else watched in awe full of questions about the relationship of the two 
girls but stayed quiet for now. As Hikari came closer, Yaya panicked 
inside. But she couldn&#39;t run, she couldn&#39;t speak, she couldn&#39;t breathe, 
every muscle in her body either slowed or froze in place except for her 
heart. And when Hikari was just right in front of the raven haired 
girl... the unexpected happens.

Yaya&#39;s vision blurs, her breaths became shallow and slow, she felt cold 
and in seconds... she blacks out. Her body became limp and almost falls 
back. Hikari surprises herself by catching Yaya behind her waist and 
neck totally avoiding what could have been a serious injury had she 
fallen back on her desk or chair.

&quot;Yaya-chan!&quot; &quot;Yaya-san!&quot; &quot;Nanto-san!&quot; Hikari and her classmates called 
out in panic and worry as they looked at Yaya&#39;s pale face.

&quot;Konohana-san?!&quot; called one of Yaya&#39;s older classmates. The tone the 
girl used was threatening and would have scared Hikari, four years ago, 
but not today. &quot;How do you know Yaya-san?&quot;

Hikari looked at girl and immediately knew that she admired Yaya in away 
something that she, again, wouldn&#39;t have noticed when she was younger. 
Hikari decides that it would be best to not sound the least bit hostile 
even though she was a little irritated by Yaya&#39;s odd and completely 
unexpected reaction to their meeting.

But before she could answer their professor decides to step in. &quot;You 
should take her to infirmary immediately!&quot; She looked at the blonde girl 
first and asked; &quot;Do you think you can carry her there?&quot; Hikari 
immediately nods, inside she was glad that she came early and looked 
around the building taking notes of where what room was. The professor 
asks other two girls to help; one to assist Hikari and the other to pick 
up Yaya&#39;s things and take it to the infirmary with her.

to be continued...

Author&#39;s notes: Well that&#39;s it for the first chapter. I was so tempted 
to use some Japanese words and phrases or those trademark reactions, 
especially those that might make the character more realistic and make 
you feel that you watched a scene instead of reading about it but 
decided against those while it can be helped.

First non Strawberry Panic character making her Cameo is Satou Sei from 
Maria-sama ga Miteru. More to come! Stay Tuned!</pre>
