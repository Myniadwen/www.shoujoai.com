<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 15 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ninemil.html">ninemil</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&quot;With an ounce of common sense you&#39;d have bought a hamster and taken 
Kendo like everyone else,&quot; Kaname muttered over her shoulder, before 
glancing down at the muddy flecks splattered across her legs and the hem 
of her skirt.

She grimaced as she brushed at the crusty blotches on her uniform, the 
action only smudging them into wide sweeping arcs and making the stains 
appear much worse than they had when she&#39;d started. She sighed, 
abandoning the effort as she straightened up, waiting as Amane bolted 
the stable doors closed for the night, the former-Etoile struggling in 
the bellowing wind.

The pair stood amongst the bowing foliage outside the Stable barn, the 
early evening wind whipping around them, the muffled neighing of 
unsettled animals within subsiding as Amane called soothingly through 
the woodwork.

There would be storms tonight, Kaname realised, eying the cloudy sky and 
feeling the first spots of rain on the back of her neck. The weather 
always turned shitty when she came to this god forsaken hole.

Successful in securing the wooden building, Amane turned back to the 
tennis star, reaching down for the large cloth sack of dirty uniforms 
that she&#39;d left on the ground beside the water trough, the fifth year 
finally gathering herself to leave. Spotting Kaname&#39;s weary demeanour 
and troubled brow, she couldn&#39;t help but grin as she raked a free hand 
through her messy black hair.

Catching the former-Etoile&#39;s amusement, Kaname snapped back wryly,

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare,&quot; she snarled playfully, sighing as she added,

&quot;I feel like a farmer.&quot;

Amane&#39;s smirk became a chuckle, and she shrugged blankly as she heaved 
the sack over her shoulder, the contents one of the few remaining tasks 
she had left to deal with before shutting the equestrian school down for 
the winter break. As per usual, Amane would be the first to return, the 
last to leave, such was her dedication to the unit.

As the former-Etoile stepped away from the shelter of the stable 
building, she too caught the cold precipitate and gestured skyward to 
her companion,

&quot;We should hurry; that&#39;s going to come down hard when it gets going.&quot;

Kaname nodded in agreement, and the two girls hurried out across the 
school grounds towards the warmth and safety of the Dormitories beyond. 
With the exertion of walking so quickly it became easier not to attempt 
conversation, and both girls fell silent, lost in their own thoughts as 
they travelled.

Amane had enjoyed the afternoon, and although the two girls had taken 
much longer to work through the to-do list together than it usually 
would have taken Amane to do the jobs alone, the opportunity to teach 
her new friend the ropes had refreshed the former-Etoile. She&#39;d enjoyed 
explaining to the council assistant how and why things were done the way 
they were in the stables, doing her best to involve the dark haired 
Spican wherever she could, imparting her own enthusiasm and sharing what 
was obviously a huge part of her life.

And although Kaname hadn&#39;t intended to be so prissy, her constant and 
almost comical discomfort, whilst extremely amusing on one hand, had 
complicated matters on the other and she&#39;d ultimately hindered more than 
she&#39;d helped. Perhaps there was even a degree of phobia there, Amane 
pondered, noting how irrational Kaname could be around the horses. 
Regardless however, the afternoon had provided Amane with precious hours 
of much needed distraction, taking the former-Etoile&#39;s mind off the 
evening ahead.

She still considered the Ball with a degree of trepidation, unsure of 
her own reaction upon seeing Astrea&#39;s new Etoile on the dance floor, 
uncertain how poignant the memories it might conjure forth could be. 
Somewhere in the back of her mind however, she caught herself glad that 
she wouldn&#39;t be facing them alone.

As the rain hit properly, the two girls sprinted the final span across 
the Dormitory grounds, the driveway grit kicking up with the full 
ferocity of the downpour, the earth below them a mat of tiny impacts and 
shimmering black liquid, the shifting surface mirroring the moody skies 
above as it raced toward the open drains.

Reaching an alcove set within the sweeping outer wall, Amane fumbled in 
her jacket pocket for one of the housekeeping keys to open the serving 
entrance stood before them. Although not something officially allowed 
under the school rules, the popular show jumper had long befriended the 
kitchen staff enough to buy passage back and forth to the stables 
whenever she chose, at whatever hour that might happen to be.

Kaname, huddled against her fellow fifth year to avoid the downpour, 
raised a brow in curiosity.

&quot;I always wondered how you managed to get out so early,&quot; she called over 
the thunderous drumming around them, grinning despite the trickle of 
water running from her damp hair, down across her face,

&quot;You&#39;re gonna be handy in future aren&#39;t you,&quot; she laughed.

Amane rolled her eyes, still struggling with the antiquated lock,

&quot;It&#39;s for practice Kenjo-san, not crawling home after a night off 
premises.&quot;

The council assistant shrugged with feigned innocence, then beckoned for 
the show jumper to hurry up, the icy pelt chilling her back as it found 
a way through her collar line and out across her previously dry skin.

&quot;God woman, go faster already, this is freezing!&quot; she snapped.

Feeling a feint click from the mechanism, Amane stepped back, taking 
another barrage from the thunderstorm whilst pulling the door wide for 
her companion.

&quot;For someone so self-assured, you don&#39;t half whine a lot Kaname,&quot; she 
replied.

The council assistant curled her lip into a playful sneer and then 
passed by, out into the Dormitory grounds proper.

Bolting across the courtyard after slamming the wooden portal closed 
again, the two Spicans raced to the kitchen doorway, pulling at their 
boots awkwardly whilst ducking in beneath the shelter of the masonry 
overhang above them.

Stepping onto the damp gravel, feeling her socks soak through instantly, 
Kaname grumbled again, reminding Amane of a disgruntled old man who&#39;d 
just woken to find his afternoon cup of tea had very thoughtlessly gone 
cold during an unexpected nap. The tennis star was so indignant in her 
disapproval, so thoroughly annoyed that Amane couldn&#39;t help but laugh 
again, prompting a raised eyebrow from the taller girl beside her,

&quot;What?&quot; she said, failing to silence her own urge to laugh, &quot;What?!&quot;

The former-Etoile grinned and shook her head, resting a hand briefly on 
Kaname&#39;s arm.

&quot;Thank you Kenjo-san,&quot; she said, looking the older girl in the eye.

Perplexed and completely forgetting the pouring rain around her, the 
council assistant straightened up, looking her companion over with 
bemusement.

&quot;For what Amane?&quot; she asked.

But her fellow fifth year just smiled, and twisting a second key in the 
lock before her, she cracked the kitchen door open.

&quot;First or second in the shower?&quot; Amane asked, ignoring the question, 
motioning into the gloom beyond.

But Kaname failed to respond, still looking for subtext.

&quot;Fine, you get second then,&quot; the show jumper declared, disappearing into 
the waiting portal before her.

Watching the slender woman melt into the pitch black preparation room, 
Kaname&#39;s face retained its puzzled grin.

- - - - -

&quot;Okay, so now I understand,&quot; Emmie grinned, peering through the 
windscreen as the vehicle&#39;s wipers raced furiously back and forth, 
washing away the obscuring torrent of rain from their view.

Sat in Emmie&#39;s purring Aston Martin, the two girls looked out across the 
busy Christmas street towards one of the department stores located on 
the near corner of the pedestrianised area. Regardless of the heavy rain 
and bitingly cold winds, the city centre was still heaving with early 
evening shoppers, and the couple had to strain to see the window in 
question amongst the throng of people passing by. Conscious of the 
number of cars attempting to overtake her against the returning traffic 
on the other side of the road, Emmie flicked the indicator as she 
reached over her shoulder to see if the road was clear.

&quot;I&#39;ll pull into the multi-storey,&quot; she said, grinning again as she 
caught Nagisa&#39;s appreciative smile.

&quot;I only wish I had the chance to be there. I&#39;d love to see the look on 
Shizuma&#39;s face,&quot; the French woman chuckled, and making sure the way was 
clear, she let the handbrake lose and slid the sleek black automobile 
back into motion, adding enthusiastically,


&quot;Because tonight, my dear, you are going to look absolutely stunning.&quot;

- - - - -

&quot;Your turn hamster girl,&quot; Amane remarked as she reappeared from the 
bathroom, a soft white towel wrapped around her, a corner of which she 
was using to ruffle her dark bob.

Kaname looked up from her place perched on the Dormitory window sill, 
twisting her face in mock contempt,

&quot;I had a gerbil I&#39;ll have you know,&quot; she said, beginning the difficult 
task of unbuttoning her soggy white top, &quot;and it was a damn sight easier 
to clean out than that monstrosity in the stables.&quot;

Her eyes flashed as the former Etoile dismissed the remark, continuing 
to dry herself off. Managing the final button, Kaname pulled the sagging 
garment free from her shoulders, carefully hanging the saturated fabric 
across the back of Amane&#39;s desk chair,

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen so much shit in my life,&quot; she grimaced, and then leered 
as she continued in her mocking tone, &quot;How can you adore that thing so 
much?&quot;

Amane shook her head, and then rolled her neck to relax her tense 
shoulders. Despite the light-hearted atmosphere, deep within she could 
feel the anxiety quietly growing.

The Ball was going to be far from an easy affair, and Kaname&#39;s eyes 
narrowed as she picked up on the young woman&#39;s thoughtful pause.

Stood in her bra and briefs, the council assistant already having shed 
her soaking wet skirt, Kaname turned to reach for one of the spare 
towels that Amane had gathered for them on the bed, the former-Etoile 
catching the intention and passing it to her directly.

Standing face to face, Kaname was about to impart a snide comment about 
scholarship students and single rooms to derail her friend&#39;s downward 
slide, when, to their collective surprise, there was a click from the 
Dormitory door behind them.

Turning in shock, the two semi-naked girls looked back to find they&#39;d 
been joined by another figure, the newcomer dressed in sopping wet beige 
coloured slacks and a plain white sports top, their face covered by a 
raised hood.

The stranger was leant back against the door, breathing heavily from 
some previous exertion, regarding the Spican pair from beneath the soft 
shroud.

&quot;Is there something we can do for you?&quot; Kaname called sternly, the fifth 
year moving to cover her exposed chest with the towel that Amane had 
handed to her.

The show jumper had reacted similarly, moving to cover herself more 
properly.

But the stranger didn&#39;t reply, and Amane craned her neck to see.

The individual was shorter than the pair of them, petite in build, 
elegant curves only partially obscured by the looseness of the heavily 
drenched jogging bottoms. From the stance and the leg line, it was 
obviously a young woman.

Amane&#39;s heart jumped.

- - - - -

They&#39;re laughing.

Stood in the dim hallway light, the young figure huddled against the 
bedroom door with her ear bent to the woodwork, her clouded mind 
surprised and confused by the jovial echoes drifting from the Dormitory.

Why are they laughing?

All thoughts of remaining concealed long abandoned, the young woman 
pressed harder, feeling the water on her skin squelch against the oak 
surface, desperate to hear clearly through the wooden slab. Perhaps it 
was someone else? Perhaps the Dormitories had changed?

Panic rising within her, worried as to who or what she might find 
inside, the nervous figure fought with her apprehension, trying to 
gather herself enough to crack the door, to enquire within. But in her 
winter shell of loneliness and isolation, the young woman had never 
imagined she might return to hear this, to hear anything but a 
resounding silence or low sobbing coming from this Dormitory, to find a 
mournful loss fit to match her own.

Hurt and increasingly unnerved, the hooded figure reached for the brass 
handle before her.

- - - - -

&quot;Do you mind?&quot; Kaname reasserted with an angry tone to her voice, but 
Amane had already stepped forward, ignoring the council assistant behind 
her.

&quot;Hikari?&quot; the unnerved woman asked, her voice broken, her hand 
outstretched gingerly, not wanting to believe her eyes and yet unable to 
stop her feet from approaching.

The stranger remained stationary, frozen to the spot.

Kaname swept across the room, reaching for Amane&#39;s shoulder in an 
attempt at stopping her companion,

&quot;Amane, don&#39;t -&quot;

But before she could finish, the youngster let loose a terrifyingly 
pitched scream, falling backwards over her feet as she scrambled to 
reopen the door.

Lunging forward, Amane caught the girl&#39;s top, halting her retreat, the 
soft woollen hood falling away in the brief struggle.

Piercing blue eyes stared back at the fifth year, their rims already red 
and filling with fresh tears, the familiar yet unexpected features 
twisted in anguish.

Soaked to the teeth, expression unhinged and her lip quivering as her 
eyes welled, Hikari Konohana stood before them, her long blonde locks a 
damp mess and her skin pale and blotchy from the evening&#39;s exposure to 
the elements.

&quot;Hikari...&quot; Amane repeated, but having eased her grip in astonishment, 
Amane fumbled as the tiny third year pulled her garment free, turning 
again before disappearing through the door and out into the corridor 
beyond.

Mindless of her scant attire, Amane bolted after her, the two girls 
vanishing through the Dormitory doorway as Kaname hurriedly pulled her 
top back on, desperate to follow the pair.

- - - - -

&quot;Hikari!&quot; the show jumper screamed, barrowing down the hallway towards 
the fire escape at the end of the corridor. The tiny third year was 
sprinting though, and not encumbered by her lack of clothing as Amane 
was, she cleared the wooden hallway long before the fifth year could 
catch up, the fire door banging back and forth as she disappeared into 
the stairwell behind.

Amane put her head down, slamming into the door, tumbling as she lost 
her balance, trying to avoid the figure suddenly apparent beyond. For 
some reason, Hikari had stopped on the landing, her tiny body curled 
against the railings, and as Amane twisted to avoid her, the two 
collided in a mass of bodies, a sickening crunch to be heard as the 
fifth year hit the wall opposite the door frame.

Bewildered, Amane tried to push herself up from the deck, doing what she 
could to reorientate herself. Hikari, the blonde third year still lying 
on the floor beside her, was face down, trying to push herself up onto 
her knees.

&quot;Hikari,&quot; the fifth year stammered, fighting a wave of nausea from the 
impact.

The younger girl shook her head, her matted blonde curls a damp brown 
mess. She looked sideways, her eyes shadowed by tears, her small lips 
parsed in confused rejection.

For a moment, there was little but the sound of their panting breaths.

&quot;Amane-senpai?&quot; she finally managed, her look of anguish beginning to 
fade, returning to one of youthful bewilderment.

The fifth year squinted, trying to clear her head. The fall had jarred 
her, and the side of her head and left shoulder were throbbing 
painfully.

&quot;Hikari, why did you run?&quot; she asked, her own confusion telling, &quot;Where 
have you been? How long have you been back?&quot; she pressed,

But the younger girl simply crawled forward on her hands and knees, 
stopping beside the former-Etoile.

&quot;You&#39;re hurt...&quot; Hikari mumbled, reaching for the side of Amane&#39;s head.

The fifth year felt a woozy sensation in the pit of her stomach, and 
closed her eyes briefly to help it subside.

&quot;You ran Hikari?&quot; she repeated, speaking from behind the shelter of her 
smothering eyelids.

The third year paused, not reaching any further, her hand hanging in the 
void between them. Amane was barely covered, her towel landing in the 
same mismatched state the fifth year had, and both her pale shoulders 
were exposed, her sloping neck line framed by the painted woodwork 
behind her, the fifth year&#39;s ruffled hair a messy shock above.

Aware of, and suddenly uncomfortable in the extended silence, Amane 
reopened her eyes to find Hikari staring at her, watching as the 
youngster&#39;s expression changed,

&quot;Amane-senpai...&quot; the little blonde repeated, her blue eyes soft.

The Spican star felt her back stiffen as she shifted her weight, ill at 
ease and conscious of the cold air on her skin. She moved to cover 
herself better.

&quot;Hikari, why did you run?&quot; she asked again, hoping for a response.

The youngster&#39;s face dropped, and she rocked back to sit on her heels, 
her head hung, her puffy face hidden by her dirty curls.

&quot;Amane-senpai was... was laughing,&quot; she said, exuding rejection and 
hurt, her bottom lip curled.

The fifth year tipped her head, closing her eyes in understanding.

&quot;I...&quot;

She wasn&#39;t sure what to say, suddenly very aware of how the happy 
atmosphere in the Dormitory might have been perceived without knowing 
the subtext beneath it.

She took a deep breath, searching for a response,

&quot;But Hikari, I -&quot;

The third year cut her off,

&quot;I was so desperate to see Amane-senpai, so needed to be with her,&quot; and 
she dipped her blue pools again, her face written in misery, &quot;When she 
ended our call, I was so scared I&#39;d made her angry, that she wouldn&#39;t 
want to see me again,&quot;

And caught up in her wave of panic and reconciliation, she leaned fully 
forward, reaching to kiss her beloved, to wrap herself up in Amane&#39;s 
arms and wash the pain away.

The fifth year took a sharp intake of breath, confused by the statement, 
and buckling under the sudden and marked discomfort that having the 
youngster&#39;s body so close to her now brought. The show jumper recoiled 
away, turning her cheek to the third year.

Hikari froze, her blue eyes yawning wide.

&quot;Amane-senpai?&quot;

Moments passed, their hearts pounding in the silence.

Letting her breath slip, Amane slowly pulled herself up, the third year 
falling backward as the older girl straightened her back again. Unspoken 
signals shot between them, Hikari confused, distressed, not wanting to 
process what she was feeling, Amane unnerved, on edge, feeling 
uncomfortable on one hand and yet desperately concerned for the 
youngster on the other.

She couldn&#39;t shake the memories or the shame that accompanied them.

&quot;Is it because I left?&quot; Hikari mumbled, her eyes blurring.

Amane took too long to gather herself, too long to regain her composure,

&quot;Does Amane-senpai love someone else now?&quot; the blonde continued, her 
blue eyes swimming,

&quot;Does she not want me anymore?&quot;

The fifth year couldn&#39;t find the words, didn&#39;t know how to explain; her 
mouth opened but the words refused to fall out.

Hikari&#39;s face contorted further,

&quot;Amane-senpai?&quot;

The anguish was so obvious, the little one pouring her heart out in a 
frantic need for acceptance, to be told she was still good enough.

&quot;I...&quot;

Amane stalled, and the third year began her own recoil, her tiny hand 
coming to the pit of chest, her head dipped forward as she stared out 
from beneath her hair.

&quot;Am I not... not right?&quot; she muttered incoherently.

Shaking her head to snap herself together, Amane reached forward,

&quot;Hikari, no, it&#39;s nothing like that. I just...&quot;

She faltered again, and Hikari&#39;s little face broke,

&quot;Is Kenjo-san prettier than me?&quot; she asked, her voice twisting as she 
forced the awful words out.

&quot;Does she do those things... those...&quot;

That was as far as she could go, the surging wave of emotion breaking 
within.

&quot;Did I do it wrong?&quot; she finally asked, tears racing from their place of 
release.

Amane&#39;s face dropped in dismay,

&quot;Hikari I -&quot;

But the gathering sounds in the corridor behind them peaked, and with a 
clunk the fire door swung open, the haphazardly dressed form of Kaname 
Kenjo appearing from amongst the crowd of curious Dormitory inhabitants 
she&#39;d held at bay.

Forcing the door closed behind her, Kaname stepped forward,

&quot;Amane, they -&quot;

But it was all too much, and finally Hikari bolted, crashing messily 
down the stairs as she fled from the horrific confrontation.

Amane reached to follow, but Kaname&#39;s firm grip stopped her, the 
towering council assistant holding her companion&#39;s arm with grim 
resolution.

&quot;Amane no, let her go, leave her,&quot; she repeated, and the show jumper 
turned to her companion with a raw glaze, her distressed mind not 
processing the words.

&quot;Let her go,&quot; the council assistant repeated.

And as two girls held their ground, the stairwell around them thumping 
with heavy footfalls from below, their ears swam with the echoed cries 
of the tiny third crashing her way down the antiquated wooden stairwell.

&quot;Why would you?&quot; she was crying, repeating over and over, &quot;Why?&quot;

And despite the occasional pause as the third year fell to her knees on 
a stairway landing, the tiny figure disappeared, leaving the two girls 
above in unsettled, stoic silence.

- - - - -

Metallic-tipped heels rang crisp in the poorly lit corridor, the sound 
musical amongst the previously dusty silence, soaring high above the now 
hushed murmurs emanating from the throng of students gathered around 
Tamao.

The dark haired Etoile had spent the entire afternoon in a flap, 
struggling to manage the final details alone, working her way back and 
forth between the Miator grand hall, the Sister&#39;s office where the 
proceeds and security keys were kept, and her own lonely Dormitory where 
she&#39;d somehow found time to prepare her own attire and appearance.

Chihaya and Mizushima had been a valuable aide, both girls doing their 
best to help the flustered fourth year in Nagisa&#39;s very noticeable 
absence, while the more detached Hitomi and Mizuho did their part in the 
background, not needing anywhere near as much input from the young 
Etoile. Regardless, with everyone pulling together, even little Chiyo 
who regularly returned for fresh burden to add to her mounting pile, the 
girls had eventually managed to finish the job.

Stood in the yawning corridor, the group had been working their way 
through one final check, Tamao nodding in relief as each point received 
a positive response from one of her attendees when the echoing clip of 
metal against wood announced the younger Etoile&#39;s return to premises.

&quot;Etoile-sama,&quot; came the hushed greetings, the parade of students 
lowering their eyes and parting pensively as the commanding figure swept 
through the hallway before them, approaching her waiting peer at the 
other end.

As the wave of bodies parted, Tamao caught her breath, taking in the 
sight before her.

&quot;Nagisa...&quot;

For a moment, Tamao was back at the theatre during the autumn play, 
stood in apprehensive silence in the shadows of stage right, watching 
with awe as her young roomie walked out onto the stage, donned in 
Chikaru&#39;s Carmen outfit.

Nagisa had obviously been shopping, her new dress nothing like the 
politely conservative first choice that Tamao had spotted in their dorm, 
the rich crimson garment before her flowing tightly across Nagisa&#39;s 
figure, the open midriff showcasing her tight tummy, the long sweeping 
hem split on one side to glimpse her perfect legs. Gathering into a dark 
halter that encircled the fourth year&#39;s slender neck, the bare shoulders 
and fitted sleeves retained the sultry Spanish look that the Carmen 
dress had given her before, and the young Etoile&#39;s auburn hair gathered 
into tight braids that stretched back across her scalp, flowering into a 
colourful shock of red and black that contrasted perfectly with the 
silky skin of her exposed lower back.

She looked stunning, the combination of dark mascara and her deep brown 
eyes, rich lipstick and the translucent bloodstone hanging idly from her 
polished Etoile pedant...

It was as though the Aoi girl had left premises and aged five years 
before returning, such was the impact of the young woman&#39;s new attire.

&quot;Nagisa?&quot; the fourth year repeated.

In comparison, Tamao looked like the good fairy to Nagisa&#39;s evil 
succubus, her ice-blue dress archetypical of conservative Ball gowns, 
her shoulders covered, the plunging front correct in its depth and the 
amount of flesh it exposed. Her hair hung loose, combed to perfection, 
every strand falling correctly, her makeup modest and underplaying her 
sapphire eyes and pretty smile. Everything about her screamed reserved 
and sophisticated, the complete opposite of her partner before her.

From amongst the crowd behind them, a quiet voice offered,

&quot;Etoile-sama look amazing together; like Cinderella and the beautiful 
but evil Queen come to enchant her.&quot;

There were murmurs of approval and agreement, and Tamao caught a twinkle 
in Nagisa&#39;s eye.

&quot;Good evening Tamao-chan,&quot; she offered.

Tamao&#39;s shoulders slumped, the tension and stress from the day&#39;s 
preparation sliding into utter defeat. She&#39;d planned to be angry when 
Nagisa returned, wanted to dress her companion down the way she&#39;d seen 
Miyuki do so many times before, the rebellious red head having done 
exactly what the school council President had told Tamao to expect her 
to do; to let Tamao down when she needed her most.

But here, stood before her in that delicious outfit, all Tamao could do 
was melt.

&quot;Nagisa-chan,&quot; she repeated in hushed awe, &quot;you look...&quot;

Nagisa smiled, her expression one of mature appreciation rather than her 
usual flush of youthful embarrassment, her confidence now in check, her 
self-image secure.

In the car on the way home, she&#39;d decided the time to readdress her 
friendship with the pretty fourth year was long overdue; that the 
difficulty between them was unnecessary and spawned more from the 
snowball of emotional baggage this final term had brought her than 
anything sinister or underhand. She&#39;d simply been too stretched to 
discern the difference before, too distracted to accept the effect the 
now infinitely more mature tone of her relationship with Shizuma might 
have had on the people around her. There was no need for the animosity 
to continue, and as soon as she had a spare moment, she aimed to have a 
long discussion with her roommate to that end. But in the mean time, 
while time was short and there were still more pressing matters at hand, 
warm acceptance and a fresh start were due.

There would be nothing more that the young woman would fail to cope 
with, she pledged.

Reaching forward, she took Tamao by the hand, smiling warmly,

&quot;You look radiant Cinderella-chan,&quot; she teased, and sighed in 
satisfaction as she glanced about happily at the gathering of 
extravagantly dressed seniors.

&quot;We&#39;re all set?&quot; she asked.

Caught off guard by the warm reception, Tamao could simply nod.

&quot;Then it&#39;s time we began,&quot; the red head noted with a grin, the fourth 
year nodding to the girls around her in appreciation before leading her 
fellow Etoile back towards the grand hall.

- - - - -

&quot;I&#39;m not leaving you in this state and that&#39;s final,&quot; Kaname repeated, 
her brow creased as she ploughed back through Amane&#39;s drawer for an 
appropriate outfit, the subdued fifth year next to her having once again 
suggested that she not attend, that the whole subject was causing way 
too much trouble.

Kaname sneered in dismissal; there was no way she was going to leave the 
show jumper alone just to have Hikari reappear. The tiny blonde had 
already done enough damage as it was; there was no way she was going to 
permit further disruption.

But time was short and the lack of options were making life difficult. 
This was the Astrea Christmas Ball; Amane wouldn&#39;t be permitted entrance 
in any old junk, and the fifth year had obviously disposed of anything 
she might have brought previously to provide herself with a convenient 
excuse not to attend.

Kaname was beginning to panic, noting that were she completely honest 
with herself, the reappearance of Amane&#39;s young lover had unnerved the 
council assistant almost as much as it had unnerved Amane herself. Was 
she right? Had she heard the tiny third year say something about that 
phone call? Kaname eyed the failed Etoile nervously, wondering whether 
the comment had drawn the show jumper&#39;s suspicions.

But given Amane&#39;s apparently docile demeanour so far, it seemed very 
unlikely.

Continuing her search, Kaname muttered with false preoccupation,

&quot;I have to make an appearance, I don&#39;t get a choice; it&#39;s part of being 
on the school student council. And there&#39;s no way I&#39;m leaving you here 
to deal with this alone,&quot; she stressed, throwing a sideways glance at 
the other Spican, making sure the young woman perched in an emotional 
heap on the end of her Dormitory bed had caught the paternal sentiment 
that she&#39;d layered for her.

Amane was a shell, her inner flame snuffed by the unexpected encounter 
and her inability to explain to, or reassure the young blonde.

She&#39;d wanted to reach for her former beloved, to curl the tiny figure 
into her arms and take the hurt away, to fix what she&#39;d broken. But the 
fifth year couldn&#39;t, her actions stopped by the knowledge that opening 
that door would only make matters worse in the long run, only confuse 
the tiny Spican further. She&#39;d felt dirty and ashamed, wrong for having 
taken such youthful innocence and derailed it, wrong for being so unable 
to set things right afterward.

&quot;I&#39;m a monster,&quot; she muttered, holding her head in her hands as she 
stared in anguish at the floor &quot;a letching, perverted monster.&quot;

&quot;Amane!&quot; the council assistant snapped.

Kaname&#39;s anger was obvious, her face vexed with a combination of 
frustration and panic. This was all going wrong; days of work, all that 
time invested only to have the little bitch reappear and ruin it.

&quot;Enough,&quot; she reasserted, stabbing a finger at the fifth year in 
declaration,

&quot;The only thing you&#39;re guilty of is being human. Now stop this 
self-defeating bullshit.&quot;

The council assistant stepped towards the crumbled figure, tossing the 
collection of potential garments she&#39;d found onto the desk to her left.

&quot;You made a mistake, an honest, human mistake. She&#39;s young and immature, 
and no one can do this for her. Give it time and she&#39;ll figure this out 
on her own.&quot;

Her voice dropped, the council assistant opting to take a calmer 
approach as her mental thread came together, the fifth year directing 
her ongoing sermon down a newly found arc. Figuring reason work would 
better than raw aggression, Kaname offered cold, hard logic, the tall 
tennis star stood with her arms crossed behind the failed Etoile.

&quot;If it hadn&#39;t been you Amane, it would have been someone else, and 
properly someone a lot less respectable at that. We all go through this 
shit; I know I did. Now stop stressing yourself out about something you 
can&#39;t change.&quot;

Amane shook her head again, still resting it in regretful hands, her 
dark bob a mess of tufts escaping between her fingers.

Kaname pushed again,

&quot;You feel responsible Amane, I know that. But think about it for a 
moment; look at Shizuma. Did she react any differently with Nagisa?&quot; and 
the fifth year caught a shift in Amane&#39;s eyes, realizing the tact was 
working,

&quot;How were you to know any different? Can you read minds? The two girls 
are the same age even if they are in different years. How were you to 
know that Hikari wasn&#39;t ready?&quot;

Amane lifted her head, her vision impaired by fresh tears. She looked at 
Kaname with a look of clouded consideration.

Knowing she was on a roll, Kaname rammed her point home, once again 
building her voice for effect,

&quot;Now how about, just this once; how about you do what&#39;s good for 
Ohtori-san?&quot;

She stepped away, off handily delivering her final line as she turned 
back toward the messy bedroom drawer,

&quot;And for fucksake Amane, how about you let someone else in this time, 
rather than hiding in those shitty stables pretending it will all go 
away?&quot;

- - - - -

Kizuna bounced, clutching for Remon beside her, the second year&#39;s 
slender hand waving vaguely towards the front of the hall before them.

&quot;Look, look!&quot; she called eagerly, the heads of the girls waiting nearby 
them also turning in the direction she was pointing,

&quot;They&#39;re cutting the ribbons!&quot; she beamed.

Stood in the shelter of the Miator school entrance hall, it&#39;s 
understated and formal looking d&eacute;cor redressed for a party, the ceiling 
criss-crossed with banners and balloons and the curtains laced with 
ribbons, a throng of smartly dressed students, all of whom had gathered 
to be first to glimpse the fully decorated Ball venue, now strained to 
see the roped off fire door at the far end of the hall way.

Traditionally it would have been the front doors of the school building 
itself tied with the huge green bow that now adorned the fire exit, but 
given the shockingly poor weather outside and the flimsy but extremely 
smart dress of the students waiting patiently within, it would have been 
less than fair to ask the girls to gather on the driveway as per 
convention.

Straining to see the front, Kizuna squeezed her companion&#39;s forearm, 
sighing as she caught sight of the new Etoile in their stunning attire.

&quot;Oh Remon look, aren&#39;t they amazing?&quot; she murmured wistfully, smiling as 
the fourth year couple made their way to the front, Nagisa&#39;s heels 
clipping audibly amongst the admiring gasp of the congregation.

They looked breathtaking together.

&quot;Etoile, light and dark,&quot; someone mumbled behind them, and Kizuna 
giggled in excitement, catching the fairy tale theme.

Remon strained, craning her neck as she peered around over the rim of 
her glasses.

&quot;Where has Kagome-chan gone? She&#39;s going to miss the show if she doesn&#39;t 
hurry.&quot;

- - - - -

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kaname breathed, her dark eyes twinkling through the sloping 
arc of her coal black fringe,

&quot;Now that&#39;s something else entirely,&quot; she muttered.

Stood in the middle of the room, a reluctant looking Amane shifted 
weight from one foot to the other, feeling uncomfortably exposed in the 
tight burgundy cocktail dress that she had just emerged from the 
bathroom wearing. She felt no more comfortable in it now than she had 
when the girls had gone shopping, and were it not for her confounded 
state of mind, she&#39;d have blanket refused to attend were she forced to 
go to the Ball looking like this.

Instead, when Kaname had pulled the garment from her travel bag, she&#39;d 
simply sighed in resignation,

&quot;I have no idea how it got in there,&quot; the show jumper muttered, her mind 
still distracted by events in the fire escape,

&quot;I was sure I&#39;d left it at the changing room. I guess Shizuma must have 
paid and slipped it into my bag that evening.&quot;

Stepping back to admire the other girl&#39;s figure, Kaname had to admit 
that, in this singular instance, Shizuma had certainly displayed great 
taste.

&quot;Now all you need is a ticket, and I&#39;m sure I can work something out on 
the door,&quot; she said, her determination set. Amane was hardly a common 
face in the crowd, and they were bound to let her off the entrance fee 
given the circumstances. That or Kaname would break their faces the 
following day.

There was no way she was going to risk attending the Ball without the 
former Etoile however, not with the knowledge that Hikari might return 
while the council assistant was gone.

In her currently bewildered state, Amane was still pliable, controllable 
if Kaname could keep the two apart long enough to channel her fellow 
fifth year&#39;s thoughts in the right direction, and if things fell right, 
the tiny third year&#39;s return might not become the issue it could be 
otherwise.

Standing to her full height, Kaname smoothed her own black Ball dress 
out, checking her face briefly before turning to organise the distraught 
mess before her.

&quot;Amane come on, it&#39;s time. No more moping, no more sulk. We&#39;re going to 
have fun tonight or die trying,&quot; she said firmly, nudging at the fifth 
year to stress the point.

Amane remained blank, too drawn to argue, too tired to resist. The young 
woman&#39;s mind still a million miles away, she merely nodded and gathered 
her things, making sure she had her door key so they could get back in 
later.

Stopping for a moment, she stared briefly at the mirror, the reflection 
staring back resembling the same alien face that had peered toward her 
in the department store changing room all those moons ago. She wouldn&#39;t 
need to see the new Etoile on the dance floor, she grimaced. Just 
looking in the mirror brought it all flooding back as it was, and none 
of the memories it conjured included the happy times. Instead they cut 
straight to the chase and the day when it had all started going wrong.

Having resolved to suffer her penance as required, the weary Spican 
followed her fellow fifth year out through the waiting Dormitory door.

- - - - -

Sauntering her way past the many onlookers and turning heads, 
former-Miatorian Etoile Shizuma Hanazono approached the main entrance to 
the founding school&#39;s Grand Hall.

Dressed in a flowing emerald gown, her long silver hair enveloping her 
porcelain smooth shoulders and exposed lower back, the sixth year glided 
across the entranceway, her deep green eyes thoughtful and ponderous.

She&#39;d not seen Nagisa since breakfast, the tiny red head having 
disappeared out with Emmie again. Having completed her allotted tasks 
and delivered the remaining floristry required for the Ball, the 
solitary upperclassman had retired to her own Dorm, waiting hopefully 
for Nagisa to return so that the young couple could spend some time 
together before the Ball.

But when her fianc&eacute;e failed to return in time, Shizuma had reluctantly 
resigned to begin the evening alone, sure that Nagisa and Emmie had just 
been caught up in their study related distractions or the heavy holiday 
traffic on the way back from town. Emmie&#39;s entrances were always 
flawlessly timed; never too early to seem eager, never too late to make 
a scene, and Shizuma was sure the same would be true of Nagisa&#39;s return 
tonight.

Anything to keep everyone sweating she smiled to herself.

Meandering through the brightly decorated hallway, returning the polite 
nods of the students around her as they admired her appearance, Shizuma 
took in the d&eacute;cor, the pretty gold balloons, the holly green ribbons and 
the rich chocolate banners that fell from the ceiling, the pale printed 
kanji across them wishing the reader a Merry Yuletide.

She smiled, always having loved this time of year, despite the feelings 
of rejection and isolation it had sometimes conjured during her junior 
years, having been put into boarding by her mother. Those long terms as 
an underclassman had been so confusing, the joy and happiness she would 
find among her friends and classmates constantly underwritten by the 
nagging sense of loss that she&#39;d suffered whilst being filed so far away 
from home.

They never called, never wrote. It had been as though her parents had 
forgotten her completely, and although now fully aware of the reasons 
behind that absence, it had taken Shizuma many, many months to forgive 
her Mother afterward.

Reaching the antiquated fire doors that the Miatorian girls were using 
as a main entrance, Shizuma ran her fingers across the Ball ticket she 
was carrying, tipping her head as she moved to greet one of the fifth 
year girls stood on door duty, the brunette ready to greet the 
former-Etoile as etiquette dictated.

But before she could step forward, a husky voice behind her called for 
the sixth year&#39;s attention,

&quot;Hanazono-san, I believe you&#39;re responsible for this?&quot; came the call.

Turning, Shizuma beamed with an involuntary smile.

&quot;Oh my Amane, now where did you get that dress?&quot; she asked with feigned 
innocence, watching as the two Spican seniors approached her having 
discarded their overcoats and umbrella at the cloakroom.

Kaname was smiling her sly smile, relishing the tease, the show jumper 
on her arm obviously a cherished acquisition.

&quot;I must compliment your taste Shizuma,&quot; the tennis star continued as she 
purred with satisfaction.

Shizuma grinned, and reached for the former Etoile beside her,

&quot;Amane, you look radiant,&quot; she whispered, greeting her friend with a 
warm hug.

But as they parted, despite the Spican&#39;s curt nod of acceptance, Shizuma 
noted the troubled look swimming behind the fifth year&#39;s dark mascara.

Confused, the Hanazono girl furrowed her brow in question.

Amane shook her head subtly, her eyes still visibly distressed.

&quot;Not here,&quot; she mumbled, and stepped back to her place beside the 
council assistant.

Shizuma frowned in concern, confused as to Amane&#39;s comment and trying to 
second guess the cause.

Surely if Amane hadn&#39;t have wanted to come tonight she&#39;d have stayed 
behind?

&quot;Well I&#39;ve managed to get her this far Shizuma, let&#39;s see if she&#39;ll 
actually enter the premises,&quot; Kaname joked dryly, the humour failing to 
impact with either of the two girls she was addressing.

Noting the pause, Kaname hurried her companion on,

&quot;Good evening Hanazono-san,&quot; she said in a formal tone, nodding politely 
as the former-Etoile&#39;s position required.

Shizuma nodded in reply, watching with contemplation as the Spican 
couple dealt briefly with the official welcome and ticket inspection at 
the door, before disappearing through the fire exit in front of them.

Taking a deep breath, the sixth year moved to follow, unaware of the 
jealous brown eyes that had also considered the exchange behind her.

- - - - -

&quot;Don&#39;t turn round Kagome-chan.&quot;

The call had come from behind the tiny first year, the Lulim girl stood 
beside the stage area with Chiyo as they watched the wide Miatorian hall 
fill with brightly dressed gowns and dresses.

The doors had been open almost a full twenty minutes now, and as more 
and more of the Dormitory students arrived, the observing first years 
had been stunned to silence by the gathering crowd.

Kagome herself was the picture of elegance, the youngster dressed in a 
floor length gown that gave her the appearance of a mature young lady, 
rather than the teddy wielding junior that the Dormitories had come to 
know and love. Her mousey brown ringlets framing her pretty face and her 
deep green eyes swimming with the amazing sights before her, the little 
one had jumped at the sound of her name and the voice that had used it.

&quot;Chikaru-senpai?&quot; she called quietly, not wanting to disobey and turn to 
her addresser, but confused as to the request all the same.

&quot;Stay right there,&quot; came the fifth year&#39;s voice.

Kagome did as she was told, her slender hands clasped at her waist, 
stood to perfect attention as required.

Chiyo was beaming beside her, and from the corner of her vision she 
caught the ice-green shimmer of Remon&#39;s dress, the second year grinning 
over her glasses at the youngster.

&quot;Um...&quot; Kagome mumbled, her confusion mounting.

&quot;A moment longer,&quot; Chikaru teased, her soft voice musical amongst the 
background chatter floating throughout the hall.

It was dim in the chamber, the coloured spots and the numerous candles 
giving the venue a warm but atmospheric glow.

&quot;And...&quot; Chikaru paused,

&quot;..there!&quot; she called.

Kagome turned, her deep green eyes peering out from beneath her fringe.

Chikaru was stood before her, Kizuna in her brown dress on one side, 
Remon on the other. The school council President was exemplary in her 
midnight-blue kimono, the Lulim girl once again having gone far beyond 
everyone else; daring to wear the most modern reworking of the 
traditional Japanese Hikizuri. Wrapped within the slinky satin folder 
over, the outfit was an eclectic mix of reserved cut and smouldering 
Geisha suggestion, the usually thick layers cut back to showcase her 
figure, her dark hair uncharacteristically drawn into a tight weave, the 
plain wooden sticks holding her topknot above dipping as she moved.

Smiling through the thick makeup she&#39;d worn to match the outfit, the 
Lulim president&#39;s eyes twinkled with mischief. Before her, held in her 
outstretched hands was a neatly wrapped parcel.

&quot;Happy Christmas Byakuden-san&quot; she said, grinning as she offered the 
present.

Kagome&#39;s little jaw dropped, the first year overwhelmed.

Certainly no one had told her to expect presents, and she felt ashamed 
at not having prepared any to give to the others.

Chiyo, still dressed in her Miatorian uniform as she&#39;d predicted she 
would be, nudged the youngster in the ribs.

&quot;Open it Kagome-chan,&quot; and she whispered in a tiny voice, &quot;you shouldn&#39;t 
keep Minamoto-san waiting, it&#39;s rude.&quot;

Kagome&#39;s lips parsed, and she dipped her head further,

&quot;Minamoto-senpai,&quot; she began quietly, &quot;I didn&#39;t know we were giving 
presents.&quot;

Chikaru grinned,

&quot;We&#39;re not Kagome-chan,&quot; and she teased ambiguously, &quot;I am.&quot;

Kagome&#39;s lips twisted into a shameful pout, and she lowered her eyes as 
she reached forward, feeling awkward about accepting the gift.

Taking the brown parcel, the paper tied neatly with a bright red bow, 
the first year looked about, hopelessly lost.

Chiyo beckoned her toward the corner of the stage, ushering her in 
excitement,

&quot;Open it here Kagome-chan,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll make space.&quot;

Kagome did as she was told, Chiyo sweeping the gathered papers from the 
wooden surface, the other girls gathering around them to see Chikaru&#39;s 
gift.

Staring intently as the youngster carefully undid the ribbon bow, 
Chikaru clasped her hands together beneath her chin, brimming with 
excitement.

&quot;Oh...&quot; Kagome mumbled, her green eyes wide with surprise as she viewed 
the open parcel before her.

Kizuna clapped in approval, bouncing up and down as she grinned at 
Chikaru enthusiastically.

&quot;At St Lulim Girl&#39;s school we&#39;re not the competitive type, unlike the 
students of Miator and Spica,&quot; Chikaru began, explaining her reasoning 
behind the choice of gift, &quot;but we still do our best to reward those 
among us who do outstanding things.&quot;

Stepping forward, she took the object from the crumbled paper it was 
cradled in, unfurling it as she held her offering up to the overwhelmed 
first year before her.

&quot;So as a token of my appreciation for all your hard work as my personal 
assistant, I would like to present you with your official assistant&#39;s 
jersey, Kagome Byakuden, and look forward to the coming year, with you 
continuing to work at my side.&quot;

Accompanied by a murmur of wonderment from the girls around them, Kagome 
looked up at Chikaru, the tiny figure watching as Chikaru curled the 
hand-embroided cardigan around the little one&#39;s shoulders.

Unlike the standard Lulim uniform, Chikaru&#39;s creation featured 
delicately weaved patterns that boarded the cuffs, the dark markings 
recounting the school motto in its Latin form, the right garment breast 
marked with a special school emblem, declaring the bearer as an official 
part of the Lulim student council.

&quot;I&#39;ve made sure that the staff and fellow council members are aware of 
the significance, and from now on you&#39;ll be greeted in the appropriate 
manner, council assistant Byakuden-san.&quot;

Kizuna bubbled over again, and Kagome, peering up at the taller girl 
before her, offered her humble gratitude,

&quot;Thank you very much Minamoto-senpai,&quot; she mumbled, her tiny voice even 
softer than usual, her bottom lip full to the brim.

&quot;Kagome-chan isn&#39;t used to being made an exception,&quot; she said quietly.

Chikaru beamed, her pretty eyes sparkling from behind her pale Geisha 
foundation,

&quot;But you&#39;re a very exceptional person Kagome, so it&#39;s about time that 
changed.&quot;

Then, glancing around quickly, she scanned the mass of bodies for an 
opening,

&quot;Shall we find a better spot? The Etoile should be here any moment.&quot;

- - - - -

It&#39;s all going wrong.

Staring out across sea of girls milling their way through the wide 
events room, Kaname peered from beneath the shadow of the Balcony 
overhang, the moody council assistant propping up one of the oak 
pillars, her jaw set and her dark eyes mirroring the flickering candle 
light beyond. Her coal black fringe skirting her thunderous expression, 
she gazed intently out across the crowd, hoping to god she didn&#39;t spot 
the delicate features of the blonde third year responsible for the 
evening&#39;s unrest.

Amane had retired to the restroom, the young woman still an obnoxious 
emotional mess, her nerve shattered and her continuous state of 
distraction nothing like the jovial evening the council assistant had 
planned.

This was supposed to be her crowning glory, her moment of triumph, and 
she snorted in contempt at the irony of her situation; here was her 
grand end to the term, hoards of admiring juniors and Kaname&#39;s jilted ex 
looking on with envy as the two Spican superstars graced the Ball arm in 
arm, one strong woman beside the next.

If only the reality were even close.

Instead, Amane was hiding in the loo, and Kaname stood alone, waiting 
for the whole diabolical disaster to end.

Things were not supposed to be happening this way.

And as she watched Amane reappear from the toilet door on the other side 
of the room, she wondered how much longer it would take for things to 
unravel entirely, how long before the understatedly-attractive young 
woman approaching her ran back to her snivelling little bitch, costing 
Kaname not only her previous relationship, but any chance of a future 
one to follow it.

- - - - -

&quot;Well,&quot; Nagisa asked, her sultry eyes flicking sideways, her deep brown 
gaze regarding the other Etoile, Tamao stood beside her, &quot;Shall we?&quot;

Reaching forward, her slender fingers curling around the heavy curtain 
edge, preparing to draw aside the thick fabric that sheltered them from 
the excited crowd beyond, Nagisa watched as Tamao turned to her partner, 
her features set, the young woman trying to prepare herself mentally for 
the grand event.

Meeting the red head&#39;s gaze, the raven haired senior looked 
questioningly into her old friend&#39;s eyes, unsure of the sudden 
recompense, unsure how to read the change of tone, but unspeakably 
thankful nonetheless.

She&#39;d thought she&#39;d ruined it all. She&#39;d thought this was gone.

Nagisa&#39;s shining platinum band glinted in the dim light as she held the 
curtain, the red head watching as she waited for Tamao&#39;s response. The 
past few days had been a blur of preparation and emotional turmoil, the 
term finally drawing to its climatic peak this coming moment, yet Tamao 
could only have wished for this outcome, could only have prayed for the 
chance at a clean slate.

&#39;To become the finest Etoile Astrea has ever seen,&#39; the fourth year 
repeated in her head, remembering Miyuki&#39;s words from the Dormitory 
lounge so many weeks before.

Together, with this fresh understanding apparent between them, perhaps 
that might actually be achievable; and for their own gratification this 
time, rather than some sick attempt at revenge on the council 
President&#39;s behalf.

Perhaps, with the mess finally behind them, the two friends could face 
the future side by side, their foundations strong once more, their 
Etoile partnership everything it should have been from the start.

&quot;Together, Nagisa-chan?&quot; she asked, her voice trembling with 
underwritten emotion.

Smiling fondly as she touched her dear friend&#39;s arm, Nagisa nodded 
resolutely,

&quot;Together Tamao-chan,&quot; she replied, pausing for a moment to hold the 
deep blue gaze staring back at her.

Then with a warm smile, the young woman pushed back the heavy shroud, 
stepping forth into the glaring spotlight and rising applause from the 
stage beyond.

- - - - -

Shizuma turned the stiff white card in her hands over and over, her 
green eyes flicking up toward the balcony above, scouring the dimly lit 
overhang for its source. Perplexed, she reread the single italic phrase 
inscribed in gold across one side,

&#39;Chalon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne&#39;

The card has been delivered by an embarrassed looking first year, the 
youngster flushed and self-conscious, her lack of ease not easily 
dismissed and her explanation hasty, the formal greetings rushed so she 
could depart as fast as possible,

&quot;Someone is waiting for you on the Balcony,&quot; she&#39;d said, before 
disappearing off into the crowd with a hurried bow.

Noting the ripple of applause emanating from the stage to her right, 
Shizuma decided she may as well indulge the request a little of her 
time; her view of Nagisa would be much better from the balcony anyway, 
and the card tweaked her interest. There weren&#39;t many people that would 
remember that name.

Gathering her dress so the shimmering fabric wouldn&#39;t trail across the 
floor, the slender upperclassman climbed the winding wooden stairway, 
glancing occasionally at the stage below, watching with a smile as 
various figures scuttled across the raised platform, preparing for the 
opening performance from the new Etoile.

She considered the remaining duties that lay before the pair of them, 
eager to get these final few hours out of the way so she and Nagisa 
could have their privacy again. Shizuma looked forward to the long 
awaited seclusion of the summer house; perhaps, once away from the 
baying mob, Nagisa would finally regain her youthful cheer. Her fianc&eacute;e 
had been such a shell of late, and Shizuma struggled to recall the last 
time she&#39;d seen the fourth year&#39;s pleasant smile.

Reaching the final step, the former-Etoile looked up from the patterned 
regal carpet that covered the aging stairs, her hand resting gently on 
the smoothly finished venire of the banister beside her.

There were few to be found this far back from the lofty view of the 
balcony&#39;s front railing, and in the dim light, Shizuma couldn&#39;t see 
anyone waiting at all. Perhaps the unfamiliar junior had been mistaken 
about the intended recipient, perhaps one of the seniors were up to 
their old tricks and had lost their nerve at the final moment. 
Regardless, there was no one here.

Dismissing the card, Shizuma was about to turn to the balcony edge, 
intending to slide in beside one of the other girls so she could watch 
the show below, when a jarring thud drew her attention further behind 
her, the sound coming from one of the terrace doors, the aging frame 
open and threatening to shatter it&#39;s fragile inset glass were it to 
remain free to rattle back and forward in the wind.

Bemused and cynical, Shizuma stepped forward with a smile, half 
expecting Mizuho or Hitomi to jump her with an outstretched Christmas 
present; it wouldn&#39;t have been the first time.

But instead, as she neared the swinging terrace door, she found herself 
greeted by someone else entirely.

- - - - -

&#39;If I lose her now, that will be it, my last chance gone.&#39;

Miyuki stared again into the floor length mirror before her, her legs 
refusing to move and her nerve threatening to break.

She couldn&#39;t do this. She&#39;d never once been strong enough to confess her 
feelings to her long standing friend, and yet here she was, telling 
herself she was ready to do just that.

Miyuki had sat and watched as her silver haired mentor had gone from one 
pretty face to the next, girl after girl throughout the course of their 
juniors. As the pair became seniors, she&#39;d actively introduced her to 
Sakuragi-san herself, only to lose both immediately after. And then, to 
her gut wrenching dismay following the many months she&#39;d stood at 
Shizuma&#39;s side throughout her grieving period, she&#39;d watched it happen 
all over again with the Aoi girl. All that time, and without a single 
word, never once having spoken out despite being so completely 
infatuated with the silver haired temptress.

So how was it now that she thought she could go through with this?

&#39;But I was good enough once; this, this was good enough once,&#39; she 
repeated, casting determined eyes across the slender figure before her.

And faced with a miserable future of domestic subservience alongside her 
parentally nominated beneficiary, the young woman once again rallied her 
courage, shaking the fear and apprehension that had always bested her in 
the past.

&quot;I can do this,&quot; she declared to the mirror, her words repeating 
mentally, their tone taking a resolute edge,

&#39;I have to.&#39;

- - - - -

&quot;Chalon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne?&quot; Shizuma asked, her tone inquisitive, her words 
spoken toward the floating silhouette sheltered in the dark recess 
beside the bellowing doorway before her.

Stood in the shadows of the sweeping terrace curtain, school council 
President Miyuki Rokujo watched as the former-Etoile meandered closer, 
her steps tentative, the Hanazono girl unsure of her former room mate&#39;s 
agenda or of what to expect next.

Miyuki remained concealed, her eyes down cast as she watched the sixth 
year&#39;s feet edge nearer.

Anxious, her chest rose slowly as she took one final, measured breath as 
she replayed her chosen words, once again fighting to retain her nerve.

&#39;If I lose her now...&#39;

&quot;Was that evening so forgettable Shizuma?&quot; she asked, her tone measured 
and aloof as she delivered her lines.

Shizuma stopped short of the carpet edge, a little aside of her secluded 
companion. The question was ambiguous, the subtext unclear.

Reaching out her left hand, but without allowing her eyes to leave the 
shrouded figure to her right, the former-Etoile carefully pulled the 
terrace door to.

&quot;You have me at a disadvantage Miyuki,&quot; she said, straining to tug the 
doorframe hard enough to hear the click as it shut properly, &quot;it was a 
long week that winter in Burgundy.&quot;

Her slender fingers slipping free from the brass handle, she tipped her 
head in curiosity, her silver hair shifting about her.

&quot;Which night do you me-&quot;

She stopped, her voice trailing off as Miyuki stepped forward, Shizuma&#39;s 
question immediately answered by the council President&#39;s attire.

&quot;Miyuki...&quot; she murmured.

Long black hair framing uneasy eyes, the council senior slowly emerged 
from the safety of her shadowed recess, the tight sapphire dress she 
wore shimmering as it caught the light, her marble white skin smooth as 
it shifted beneath.

She did her best to hold her head high, stepping confidently in elegant 
blue heels, her long legs emphasised by the dress&#39;s clever seamstress, 
her smooth stomach wrapped in taut sheer fabric, the plunge of her chest 
marked by the cut, her bare shoulders set against the satin black 
strands that fell across it.

Shizuma could only watch as the memories unfurled, the sight before her 
recapturing that youthful night; the frantic rush from place to place, 
the alcoholic haze, the giggling fits as the youngsters did their best 
to avoid the drooling pack that snapped closely on their heels.

And then, outside, amongst the fluffy white snow on the high stone 
terrace, that expectant, aching gap between them before Miyuki had 
rejected her kiss.

Recollection dawning on her, Shizuma muttered in understanding,

&quot;The balloons...&quot;

Miyuki smiled, continuing the train of thought as she wandered out 
towards the balcony front,

&quot;...and the banners, the ribbons, the stage... Even down to the napkins 
Shizuma,&quot; and she looked back across her shoulder, the ends of her dark 
hair rolling midway across her bare skin,

&quot;Everything...&quot;

The edge of Shizuma&#39;s mouth curled as the most obvious point of all 
dawned upon her,

&quot;Your hair?&quot; she asked, prompting Miyuki to smile in amusement.

&quot;There&#39;s not much left in the world that money can&#39;t buy Hanazono-san,&quot; 
she said, her dark eyes twinkling.

The former-Etoile stood in silence, the memories washing over her, the 
calls of the young French lads still fresh in her mind.

And as her eyes glazed, she muttered with a suggestive grin,

&quot;Because he thinks it looks juicy,&quot; she said in a thick French accent, 
turning once again to look theatrically at her behind.

Miyuki brought a hand to her mouth, chuckling softly and her eyes 
beaming as her lips came together in a warm smile afterward.

Stood lost in the moment, Shizuma eyed her former room mate before her 
fondly.

&quot;It&#39;s the same dress?&quot; she asked, her curiosity peaking.

Miyuki nodded, straightening her back and smoothing the hem across her 
thighs to emphasize the fit. She smiled again as her mind cleared, 
Miyuki reassured as her nerve began to settle.

Shizuma shook her head, still stunned by the deja-vu.

Ticking everything over in her mind, she stumbled over one final point.

&quot;But this was so long ago now Miyuki. Why would you...&quot;

The sentence didn&#39;t need completing, the sentiment blaringly clear only 
a heart beat later. There would only be one reason why that night had 
held Miyuki&#39;s attention, why the evening might command enough 
significance for the council President to go to these lengths to 
recreate it.

&quot;That kiss...&quot; she muttered, a soft, regretful shame catching the 
former-Etoile.

Miyuki stepped forward, her eyes intent and levelled directly at her 
peer.

&quot;This was good enough Shizuma, once...&quot;

- - - - -

Feeling the bright spotlights against her skin, Nagisa took her final 
step, planting her feet at the edge of the stage, her gaze cast far into 
the crowd beyond. To her side and only a pace behind her, she could hear 
Tamao do the same, the young women holding their heads high as they took 
in the mass of bodies before them, the dark Hall beyond swimming with 
expectant eyes.

Etoile, light and dark, stood before their peers, their attire 
resplendent, their demeanour set, and as the wash of awe and applause 
rose within the chamber, the two girls smiled, their audience approving, 
their moment of release finally upon them.

Weeks of preparation and apprehensive nerves, all soon to be forgotten, 
a peaceful winter away from their responsibilities only moments ahead of 
the pair.

Watching for Chiyo&#39;s queue in the shadows beneath the stage, Nagisa 
reached back without looking away from the crowd, her slender fingers 
finding Tamao&#39;s and entwining with fluid ease, the pair raising their 
hands between them as they slowly began to circle around each other, 
drawing closer with each theatrical step.

And as the first note rang true from the powerful chamber PA, the girls 
turned, Nagisa taking Tamao&#39;s hands in her own, the Etoile dance 
beginning with split second timing as a lively Viennese waltz filled the 
chamber, the audience captivated, the entire room focused on the stage.

While the girls followed the steps with the same degree of grace and 
refine that Astrea had long come to expect from their Etoile, Nagisa 
found herself searching the crowd, her brown eyes straining to catch 
that familiar shock of silver hair.

Twirl by twirl, she scanned the assembly, finding many but not the face 
she was after.

There was Chiyo, the little first year gazing dotingly toward her, the 
tiny Miatorian&#39;s eyes deep with admiration. There was Kagome and 
Chikaru, the Lulim junior still appearing strange without her soft brown 
bear, the upperclassman looking stunning in her daring Geisha outfit.

And there was Amane, a thunderous looking Kenjo-san stood sulking beside 
her.

But where was Shizuma?

The Etoile twirled again, their feet crossing perfectly on the wooden 
stage beneath them, their heels striking sharply with each step, the 
flow and glide of their movements inch perfect in every aspect; a true 
sight to behold.

&#39;Ah!&#39; thought Nagisa, her eyes finally finding their quarry, &#39;there she 
is!&#39;

And after a second glance on the return pass, Nagisa found herself 
wondering why Shizuma looked so distressed. That, and who was the 
unfamiliar girl reaching to stop her on the stairs, the attractively 
dressed senior&#39;s face hidden by her long, flowing black hair.

- - - - -

&quot;Shizuma, wait,&quot; Miyuki called, the council President hurrying as the 
former-Etoile started down the stairway.

Pausing reluctantly, the silver haired sixth year turned back to look at 
her companion.

&quot;I&#39;m going to wait for Nagisa Miyuki, I can&#39;t help you with this,&quot; she 
said, her eyes betraying her discomfort.

Miyuki&#39;s expectance might well be justified though, a point Shizuma 
couldn&#39;t honestly deny given her past behaviour, but regardless of the 
sentiment, her timing was two years too late and the days before Kaori a 
distant memory in the sixth year&#39;s mind.

She didn&#39;t need this now. Her fianc&eacute;e would be waiting expectantly after 
the dance, and the former Etoile&#39;s place was there, by her side.

Miyuki stood at the top of the stairs looking down, her slender figure 
wrapped in shimmering fabric, her soft black hair falling across her 
face.

Shizuma has always loved her hair long, had been mortified when the 
third year had cut it short into that awful bob.

&quot;Miyuki, you&#39;re talking about things that happened a long, long time 
ago; it&#39;s not fair for you to dredge them up now,&quot; she said, 
uncomfortable with the knowledge that her playful actions still lead 
Miyuki to such distress after all this time.

She&#39;d treated her former room mate poorly over the years; the young 
woman&#39;s admission in Shizuma&#39;s Dormitory still stinging with the painful 
manner with which Shizuma had chosen to capitalize on it.

The kiss had been outright cruel.

&quot;What do you want me to say?&quot; Shizuma continued, her edge&#39;s fraying.

Miyuki looked down to the woman below her, her expression calm and her 
tone level.

&quot;I just ask that you hear me out Shizuma,&quot; she said, and she offered a 
hand to the former Etoile, &quot;after everything else, is that too much to 
ask?&quot;

Shizuma sighed heavily, her heart crushed by guilt and remorse. She&#39;d 
brought this on herself, she knew, the years of teasing and the constant 
games never solely meant in innocence, yet never fully elaborated on 
either.

Instead, she&#39;d left her friend in limbo, the comfortable prop that 
Miyuki had revealed herself as having been used for during their earlier 
rows before Nagisa&#39;s instatement a painful reminder of how closed minded 
Shizuma had been.

It should have been Miyuki at the Summer House, Shizuma knew, and the 
school council President was right in her accusations; it had been 
Miyuki there through the many months supporting her, she&#39;d earned that 
right.

And what had Shizuma done?

The sixth year shook her head, sighing heavily.

&quot;Miyuki, I can&#39;t change what I&#39;ve d-&quot;

The council President cut her off, her tone adamant,

&quot;Just listen Shizuma, please?&quot; and the dark haired senior gestured with 
open palms,

&quot;How many times have I asked that of you? How many times has it been 
me?&quot;

She drew her hands back into the a ball against her chest, adding 
pleadingly,

&quot;Just for once, please, listen to me and how I feel.&quot;

She waited, looking for a reaction. When one failed to emerge, she 
pushed again,

&quot;Don&#39;t I deserve that much?&quot; she asked, tipping the point with 
meaningful eyes.

Shizuma caved; she&#39;d always been the one doing the talking, it was 
always Shizuma letting her emotions go, always Shizuma taking her turn.

Never since those childhood days when the silver haired junior had come 
to rescue Miyuki from her spot weeping alone in the Dormitory corridor 
had the young woman asked for that comfort, not once since those far 
flung days had the council President taken her share.

And yet she&#39;d always been there, flawlessly, waiting at Shizuma&#39;s side 
to offer her arm.

&quot;Miyuki... I.&quot;

And staring at the hand offered before her, Shizuma couldn&#39;t stop 
herself from accepting it.

- - - - -

Floating on the fresh night air, soft music stirred Yaya from her nap, 
the third year curled into a lonely ball atop her bed covers, her 
restful appearance hiding troubled dreams, the Spican sleeping lightly 
as her mind raced from one dark recess to the next. Raising her head 
slightly, her bleary eyes only half open, she muttered from her hazy 
cocoon,

&quot;It&#39;s begun?&quot;

- - - - -

&quot;There was a time,&quot; Miyuki began, her eyes low as she held the slender 
hand before her, the council President leaning forward in the huge 
armchair in the reserved section of the Miatorian balcony, &quot;there was a 
time before Kaori, before the...&quot; and she paused, unable to use the 
words, &quot;a time when you used to look at me the way you did the other 
girls.&quot;

Her dark eyes misted as she continued, Miyuki&#39;s heart laid bare, the 
council President knowing she would never get this chance again.

&quot;I used to cherish those moments Shizuma; the way you&#39;d look at me, your 
teasing smiles. You made me feel so pretty, so very special...&quot;

Sat beside her in the roped off area, set a little way back from the 
front railing, Shizuma watched as Miyuki tried to articulate her 
feelings, the council President reaching deep within as she pondered 
those early days; pondered her lost opportunity,

&quot;I&#39;d always wanted to please you Shizuma, from the earliest days, I&#39;d 
wanted to live up to your expectations. I wanted to be strong and study 
hard as you&#39;d asked,&quot;

Cupping her head with her free hand, she rocked it gently, her hair 
falling through her fingers as she gazed off to one side.

Finding the words, she continued softly,

&quot;After Kaori... those moments, they had gone. You were a shell, and I, 
...I was a prop to support you, some inanimate object in the corner 
while you lost yourself in your grief.

She sighed, the dismay and anguish still clear,

&quot;For that time Shizuma, I didn&#39;t exist. I was just another face in the 
crowd.&quot;

The emotions building, the sixth year&#39;s face twisted in remembrance,

&quot;I so missed that smile. I would sit alone at night, imaging we were 
young again, that none of it had happened. I used to wrap the covers 
around me and imagine that you were whispering in my ear the way you 
used to.&quot;

She blinked back brimming tears,

&quot;I missed you so much, and I was the one stood closest to you.&quot;

She set her jaw and swallowed hard, sitting up straight in the chair and 
rising her gaze to match Shizuma&#39;s directly, her chiselled features 
stern and her dark eyes a mix of regret and reasoning,

&quot;That night in Chalon; I was young Shizuma, young and intimidated. You 
were my friend, you&#39;d been my mentor. God, you used to rock me to 
sleep... I didn&#39;t know what I was doing Shizuma, I&#39;d never kissed 
anyone, and you were so...&quot;

She paused, biting her lip,

&quot;I didn&#39;t...&quot;

But Shizuma was only half listening, her attention riddled by her guilt, 
the distress she&#39;d caused her friend now laid bare before her, and with 
no easy distractions to hide it behind.

Miyuki continued,

&quot;From that day, I&#39;d always wanted it to be you,&quot; she said, her admission 
hushed in the gloom, &quot;even when you took Kaori for yourself.&quot;

Shizuma turned, unsure she&#39;d heard the words correctly.

&quot;You...?&quot; she said, bewildered amongst her own discomfort.

Miyuki continued blankly,

&quot;Is it so surprising?&quot; she asked, and her tone took a wistful edge, &quot;She 
had such a pretty smile...&quot;

For a moment, neither girl spoke, the sounds of the dance below 
prevailing. Eventually, the evening&#39;s true purpose began to nag at 
Shizuma as the music increasingly caught her attentions; why was she 
allowing Miyuki in like this?

&quot;I...&quot; the former-Etoile began, trying to regain her composure and end 
the conversation. But Miyuki cut her off, her tone curt and direct.

&quot;But it wasn&#39;t me responsible for that smile Shizuma, and I accepted 
that.&quot;

Cold in demeanour, her chest falling with a heavy sigh, Miyuki dropped 
her eyes as she got to the point.

&quot;The day you returned to Astrea wearing that ring Shizuma, the day I had 
the girls instated as Etoile; it was then that I knew.&quot;

The sixth year released the former-Etoile&#39;s hand, bringing her fingers 
to her lips as she sat back in the depth of armchair head rest, letting 
the smoothing darkness engulf her; her next words the hardest to muster,

&quot;Only you would do something like that Shizuma, only you could be so 
bold. Seeing you wave your ring around with so little care, I knew then 
that whatever happened next, that after everything else before, I could 
not let you go; that it still had to be you.&quot;

She dropped her voice as she continued, her tone bitter and challenging,

&quot;What right has that girl to you Shizuma? Which part of our long lives 
together has she shared? Where was she during our grief?&quot;

Miyuki spat her contempt,

&quot;In three months time my father will give me to that man Shizuma, that 
man. Whatever I may hope for now, whatever plans I might have made, as 
soon as that day comes, everything will be swept aside. And like a good 
little girl, I&#39;ll be expected to settle down and continue the family 
name as is required,&quot;

She waved a hand dismissively,

&quot;Everyone I&#39;ve loved or cared for Shizuma...&quot; and her faced twisted in 
pain, &quot;that man...&quot;

She looked up, catching Shizuma&#39;s green gaze from beneath her dark hair, 
the sixth year suddenly leaning forward from the darkness to rest a hand 
on her companion&#39;s forearm,

&quot;We&#39;ll go to him together Shizuma, together as we always have been. 
We&#39;ll demand that he call the marriage off, demand he gives in to us or 
face our relationship being announced to the public.&quot;

Her lips bore a twisted smile as she relished the mental images,

&quot;Imagine Shizuma, the Rokujo family heir... with another woman. Imagine 
their shame.&quot;

Her eyes took a hopeful edge and she tipped her head, trying to catch 
the emerald eyes gazing aimlessly before her,

&quot;You and I, Shizuma; unwilling to bend, unwilling to go away quietly. 
He&#39;d have to listen, have to permit our demands.&quot;

She leaned back, watching Shizuma&#39;s face for a response, hoping to see 
some spark of acceptance.

This was everything, all she had left.

&quot;Europe, the States. We could choose a University Shizuma, go anywhere 
in the world. The Rokujo family wealth, the Hanazono family influence, 
imagine... you and I, together, free to do as we please.&quot;

She watched, hoping for something, anything from the girl opposite,

&quot;There would be no stopping us Shizuma.&quot;

But as no response came, she pointed a finger toward the stage below, 
her face determined, her tone boiling in anger,

&quot;What will her parents do Shizuma? How will they react when they find 
out eh? What kind of future can that really have?&quot;

Her mind snapping from the barrage, Shizuma suddenly looked up, her 
heart jumping.

&quot;Nagisa...&quot;

Leaving her seat, the former-Etoile swept toward the barrier, out 
towards the front of the gallery as anxiety pulled her to her fianc&eacute;e 
below.

As she reached the edge, she realised with dismay that the dance was 
almost at an end, her offer of support lacking throughout. Nagisa would 
worry, would feel alone...

Miyuki followed, her hand reaching for her fellow sixth year,

&quot;Shizuma...&quot; she called, catching the other woman, the Hanazono girl 
turning in her spot by the railing.

With no more words to follow, no more of her heart to give, Miyuki could 
only stand there, holding her friend&#39;s wrist, a sliding sense of failure 
and loss beginning to wash over her.

&quot;I was good enough once,&quot; she murmured, her gaze somewhere else and her 
eyes misting over. Gingerly, she drew the wrist towards her navel, 
pressing slender fingers against the soft fabric covering her burning 
skin beneath.

- - - - -

Nagisa had watched, in passes, as the slender girl in the blue dress had 
lead her fianc&eacute;e back up the stairs, leading Shizuma by the hand up and 
out of view. Confused, with a gathering urge to hurl her dinner building 
within her stomach, she looked again and again for some sign of the 
couple, desperately trying to spot her girlfriend amongst the wall of 
bodies on the balcony.

What was Shizuma doing? How could she behave this way, here, in front of 
all these people?

Confused, hurt and increasingly distracted as she danced, the young girl 
lost her sense of surrounding, her thoughts turning inward, the rug 
pulled from beneath her feet.

How could she?

How-

Her mind froze, a silver shock of hair appearing in her blurred field of 
vision. Looking again at the balcony, her mind racing as she tried to 
gain a clear view between twirls, she watched as Shizuma reappeared, now 
stood at the balcony railing, her back turned to the stage.

Stood once again at her side was the strange girl in the blue dress; her 
figure elegant and shapely, her long black hair spilling across slender 
shoulders. And between the bars of the balcony wood work...

Nagisa&#39;s heart leapt to her throat.

...she was holding Shizuma&#39;s hand, and on the next pass, she had drawn 
it to her stomach, pressing it again the soft fabric of her dress.

Nagisa&#39;s spirit shattered within her, the young girl&#39;s mind reeling, her 
thoughts a jumbled mess, her brain unable to cope.

Wait...

...was that...Miyuki?

- - - - -

The door had swung closed long before Yaya&#39;s sleepy mind had even had 
the chance to process it opening, the sound followed by two dull thuds 
as discarded trainers landed beside the bed frame. Stirring from her 
foetal state, still curled up on the bed, Yaya did her best to roll onto 
her back, her attempt at opening her eyes halted by the dazzling glare 
of the Dormitory light fitting above. As she moved to sit up, she felt a 
heavy weight land squarely on her hips, tiny hands pinning her wrists to 
the bed covers beneath her.

&quot;Tsu-&quot; she began, but the words were cut short as panic washed over her, 
the build and attire of the figure above feeling nothing like the pink 
haired first year that Yaya had first thought of.

Squirming beneath her captor and self-aware in nothing but her night 
dress, she felt uncomfortably damp and cold fabric pressing against her 
exposed thighs, the smell of wet hair filling her nostrils.

As she forced her bleary eyes open, she took in the delicate face 
peering down expectantly at her, the features familiar despite the dazed 
blur; the matted, dirty blonde curls, the soft cheeks streaked with tear 
stains and the red, puffy eyes above them...

...and those brilliant blue irises.

&quot;Hikari?&quot; Yaya exclaimed, her mind racing as her eyes snapped to focus.

But the third year above remained silent, her expression apprehensive, 
Hikari unable to maintain eye contact and instead staring at the myriad 
weave of Yaya&#39;s dark hair spilled across the bed covers beneath them.

Yaya did her best to sit up on her elbows, her face written with 
confusion as the third year atop relinquished her hold and slipped back 
softly into Yaya&#39;s lap.

They sat silent for a moment, Yaya&#39;s heart pounding, the dark haired 
third year staring at the blonde before her, Hikari staring nervously at 
the bed instead.

Then, leaning inward again, her damp curls rolling across her face in 
wet clumps, Hikari whispered quietly,

&quot;Please don&#39;t send me away Yaya-chan,&quot; she said, her voice small and 
riddled with uncertainty.

Yaya tipped her head to one side, still stunned by the appearance and 
puzzled further by the request.

But before she could reply, Hikari continued,

&quot;Yaya-chan liked me once...&quot; she mumbled, managing an edgy glance into 
her room mate&#39;s dark eyes.

And then, without any warning at all, Hikari leant further forward, 
pressing her lips against those of the stunned girl before her.

Yaya&#39;s eyes spilled wide with surprise, and she watched point blank as 
Hikari&#39;s eyelids closed slowly, the third year&#39;s tiny brow softening as 
the deep lines of stress and worry melted away, her expression placid 
and serene,

And as Yaya tasted salty tears and sweet lip gloss, her young mind swam 
in confusion.

- - - - -

As the final bar played and the dance came to a close, Nagisa hung her 
head, her arm limp and her fingers still entwined with Tamao&#39;s as the 
dark haired girl held their hands aloft. Nagisa&#39;s fellow Etoile, having 
sensed the change of character during the dance, turned questioning eyes 
toward her companion, the oblivious audience around them erupting with 
applause.

Waiting quietly for the appreciation to pass, the pair stood beneath the 
spotlight, amidst the cacophonic wall of clapping and fevered calls, 
Nagisa dizzy and lost in the swirling room, her soul spiralling in on 
itself,

How could she... after everything ... how ...

Then, with a weird sense of disorientation, Nagisa found herself back in 
the studio, back before Emmie&#39;s mirror, her heart pounding as she stood 
staring at her reflection, stood watching her chest rise and fall, her 
attention trapped by the determined look in her deep brown eyes.

&#39;If she truly believes in herself...&#39;

Emmie&#39;s words rang clear and true in her mind, and the young woman&#39;s 
lips curled into a vicious snarl.

The spark of hatred flared within, and as Tamao stepped away, the time 
to leave finally having come, the dark haired Etoile paused in confusion 
and concern as Nagisa remained stationary where she was in the centre of 
the stage.

Her slender hands curling into balls so tight that her fingernails drew 
blood, the seething fourth year stared up from beneath her long red 
eyelashes, her pretty face burning with anger.
