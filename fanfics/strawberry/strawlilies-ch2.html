A Small Gift

      &quot;Hey Kagome-chan, what do you want to do now?&quot; Kizuna asked, 
sliding closer to Kagome. 

      Kagome clutched her teddy bear tighter.  She was fine with sitting 
on the grass underneath some trees not far from the Strawberry Dorms, 
but now that she thought about it, there was somebody she had been 
wanting to see for a while, and since it didn&#39;t seem like it was going 
to rain again anytime soon&#133;  &quot;Boshibaru wants to go see the greenhouse,&quot; 
she finally answered. 

      &quot;The greenhouse?&quot; Lemon repeated.  &quot;You mean Etoile-sama&#39;s?  Would 
we even be allowed in there?&quot; 

      &quot;Aw, c&#39;mon!&quot; Kizuna said, quickly standing up.  &quot;It&#39;s totally 
okay.  We&#39;ll just be taking a peak!&quot; 

      &quot;Okay, but if we&#39;re caught, you&#39;re taking the blame,&quot; Lemon 
replied with a smile.  She also stood up and Kagome followed suit. 

      Much to the surprise of Kizuna and Lemon, Kagome took the lead.  
&quot;Boshibaru knows where the greenhouse is,&quot; was all she said to the two 
older girls. 

      So, Lemon and Kizuna followed Kagome as she pursued the path that 
went around the outside of the dorms and then pointed to the greenhouse 
some distance away.  It wasn&#39;t a long walk, and along the path were some 
beautiful trees and flowers.  When the three girls reached the 
greenhouse, Lemon and Kizuna were surprised (and a bit intimidated) by 
its size while Kagome seemed unfazed. 

      &quot;Boshibaru says she&#39;s in here,&quot; Kagome said, turning to face 
Kizuna and Lemon.  &quot;He wants you two to wait out here.&quot; 

      The two older girls nodded, most likely in relief.  &quot;Sure, that&#39;s 
okay,&quot; Kizuna replied. 

      Kagome turned back around and walked up the front stairs of the 
greenhouse.  She then lightly gripped the doorknob and opened the door 
to get inside. 

      Boshibaru had been right; Nagisa was here.  She was near the 
center, tending to some tiny flowers.  The late afternoon sun shone 
through the ceiling and upon her.  She looked as if she was waiting for 
someone. 

      Belatedly, Nagisa noticed Kagome.  &quot;Oh, Kagome-chan!&quot; she greeted.  
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; 

      &quot;Boshibaru said you were here,&quot; Kagome answered, walking up to 
Nagisa.  &quot;He wanted to come.  Is he allowed to?&quot; 

      Nagisa giggled.  &quot;Shizuma-sama would be okay with that.  She lets 
me come in all the time, after all.&quot; 

      A small smile appeared on Kagome&#39;s lips.  She then turned her eyes 
to the flowers Nagisa was watering.  They were beautiful white lilies, 
although they were smaller than Kagome expected. 

      Nagisa noticed what Kagome was staring at.  &quot;They&#39;re pretty, 
aren&#39;t they?&quot; the red-haired girl said.  &quot;They&#39;ll be even more beautiful 
once they bloom.  Lilies symbolize purity, so I think they would suit 
you perfectly.&quot; 

      &quot;May I have one?&quot; 

      Kagome&#39;s sudden request was surprising, even to herself.  How bold 
of her to even say such a thing!  She had even spoken for herself and 
not through Boshibaru!  Was Nagisa really that special to her? 

      Nagisa, on the other hand, didn&#39;t seem as surprised by Kagome&#39;s 
request.  &quot;Sure,&quot; she answered.  &quot;I don&#39;t think Shizuma-sama would 
mind.&quot;  She picked up a small clay pot and then, gently with her bare 
hands, dug out a lily and placed it into the pot.  She added a little 
more dirt to make sure that the roots were secure before handing the pot 
to Kagome. 

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Kagome whispered, clutching her teddy bear with her 
left arm and the clay pot with her right hand.  She looked up at Nagisa 
and then stood on her tiptoes so that she could lightly kiss the older 
girl&#39;s cheek. 

      Surprise appeared briefly on Nagisa&#39;s face, but it was quickly 
replaced by delight.  Without another word but with a sincere smile, 
Kagome turned to leave the greenhouse.  As she was going out the door, 
she passed Shizuma, who was entering.  Shizuma took a look at the lily 
in Kagome&#39;s hand, smiled, and then was on her way.  Kagome heard Nagisa 
greet Shizuma enthusiastically, but she did not look back. 

      Once she was outside and down the front steps, Kagome was greeted 
by Lemon and Kizuna.  &quot;Oh, what a cute flower!&quot; the two older girls 
exclaimed at the same time. 

      &quot;She gave it to me,&quot; Kagome said, her voice soft.  &quot;Boshibaru 
wants to help make a cake for her in return.&quot; 

      &quot;What flavor?&quot; Lemon asked. 

      &quot;Strawberry,&quot; Kagome decided, thinking of Nagisa&#39;s bright red 
hair. 

      &quot;Sounds good,&quot; Kizuna said.  &quot;Let&#39;s get Chikaru-sama to help us, 
too.&quot; 

      Lemon and Kagome nodded in agreement, and together the three of 
them headed to the Lulim school building.  As they walked, Kagome held 
the potted lily close to her heart.</pre>
