<p>----------</p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Amane: What is it about you?</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yesterday,  I had asked Hikari if she would like me to talk to her best friend,  Nanto Yaya. Although to be very honest, I’m actually quite anxious  about doing so, because if I recall correctly, my first meeting with  the girl was barely civil…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was one of those rare afternoons, where almost everyone who watches  me practice has something they cannot leave in order to watch me,  where I could actually enjoy my ride in peace. Then I spotted her,  leaning on the tree where Hikari and I first met. She looked like she  had her head in the clouds, apparently very deep in thought. There  was this gloomy air around her, like something incredibly bad had  happened and that she is at a lost on how to fix it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Normally  I wouldn’t have approached her like this, it was out of character  for me, but then I recalled that I had approached someone before…  Hikari. I know this and that aren’t the same. This girl wasn’t  singing, nor was it a misty morning… the only similarity was that  this girl was also depressed, maybe more than Hikari was then. And  with those thoughts in mind I had found myself ordering Star Bright  to walk towards the raven haired girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re…”  I called out to her; I was almost surprised that her expression  suddenly changed. She looked at me and slowly approached the fence,  she looked almost angry or she was angry. Why? I do not know.  “Hikari-kun’s friend right?” I asked, and expected that she’d  introduce herself. It was careful question and safe conversation  starter. I choose it because neither of us had been introduced to  each other, although I do not doubt she knows my name.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari  is at the Saintly Chorus practice right now.” She informed me in a  cold tone. But I knew as much, Hikari had informed me on her entire  schedule for the rest of the semester after she had asked for mine.  With that aside, her attitude bothered me a little bit and I was  disappointed that she had decided not to introduce herself to me.  Although as a sports woman, I am used to dealing with difficult  people… but she was an exception, she was Hikari’s friend. The  last thing I’d want to do is make an enemy of her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  decided to continue the conversation; I knew that she was part of the  school’s choir herself so I asked: “Aren’t you also part of the  Saintly Chorus?” I didn’t really mean anything by it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked at me with cold eyes and answered a simple; “…Yes…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  scared me a little to think that the way that she had said it felt  almost dead. But I could feel her struggling with her emotions. I  decided to drop the matter… Everyone wants to skip their duties  once in a while. I’m no different sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are  you interested in horseback riding?” I asked in an attempt to  change the topic, maybe even offer her a ride. I thought to myself  that maybe she just needed some cheering up. I thought that this was  a good chance to look good in the eyes of Hikari’s best friend, at  least that’s how I wished it to happen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she said to me; “No… Not at all…” Frankly, her cold voice  shattered some of my hope in becoming her friend, but I could feel  that she was hurting. And for some reason… I felt guilty. While  looking into her amber eyes, I found it almost impossible to break  eye contact. Honestly… I gave up, for now. As they say: You win  some, you lose some. I know that all too well that I cannot please  everyone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  quite a shame.” I said as I lowered my hat to cover my eyes and  break eye contact. I bid her goodbye as I kept my head lowered, not  daring to look at her eyes again unless I wanted to be entranced by  it all over again. I ordered Star Bright to turn around and walk  away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  didn’t know why, but looking at her made my heart beat faster. It  was painful in a way, yet pleasant in another. Almost as pleasant as  the way I feel when I look at Hikari, but the painful feeling I get  every time I see or remember Nanto-san since then confuses me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  was my memory of my first meeting her. It was so different from my  first meeting with Hikari. The way she looked into my eyes with the  cold, sad air around her haunted me that day… so much that I had  wondered what I would do if I were to meet her again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Unbeknownst  to myself, I was about to get my chance. It was lunch time, and I had  time to spare… or waste depending on how one would look at it.  Though I could have probably used it for practice instead… but  something, sometime before I even went to my horse told me that I  should make good with what I had said to Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was actually looking for Nanto-san just now, when I saw someone  walking up to me. I smiled as I realized it was Hikari-chan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello  Hikari.” I greeted her. She looked flushed, but I’m quite sure it  wasn’t mostly because of her shyness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-sempai,  have you eaten lunch yet?” She asked while twiddling with her  fingers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  I haven’t. I was looking for Nanto-san.” I watched her blue eyes  open a bit in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  told you I would try to talk to her, didn’t I?” I said to remind  her of my promise to her. She lightly gasped as she seemed to have  remembered what I said last night. She then nodded and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  over there…” She turns and points to the direction she came from.  And true enough I saw the raven haired girl standing there, writing  something in her notebook.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  placed a hand on Hikari’s shoulder, giving it a gentle and  hopefully reassuring squeeze. “Wish me luck.” She nodded and gave  me a soft smile before I walked up to Nanto-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was about to leave something on the table. I saw the name “Hikari”  on the folded paper on her hand. <em>‘A  note perhaps?’</em> that  thought led me to believe that she was still avoiding Hikari, that or  something else that didn’t cross my mind till later... which was  probably letting Hikari to be alone with me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanto-san.”  I called very politely, almost like she was someone’s parent or  guardian. I was surprised when she turned to me and flashed me a soft  smile that I swear made my heart skip a few beats. I originally  thought that she didn’t like me based on our first meeting. She  must have been having a bad day or maybe it was that time of the  month for her, but whatever the reason I’m glad it’s over. She  then opens her notebook and begins to write something... It was then  that I saw her expression change for a second and I immediately felt  that she was about to attempt to avoid a conversation with me. I  decided that I wouldn’t wait for her to do so.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  follow me. I would like to talk to you.” <em>‘Perhaps  that came out wrong…’</em> I  thought as I saw her smile almost fade from her face. I noticed her  look far behind me. She seemed lost in thought for a moment that is,  until I saw her smile a bit sourly and pocket the note she was  intending to leave before I called her, she then waved to Hikari  before following me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  lot of our schoolmates were looking, but I paid it no mind… I was  used to the attention and she probably was too. I led her outside the  school. I wanted to bring her to the spot where we first met, by that  memorable tree that she and Hikari seem to find rather comfortable  leaning on. In a way, I wanted to erase the not so good memory of our  first meeting… that is if this talk will be any better. I looked  around and was glad to find no one else around, at least not that I  could see. I wouldn’t want a simple meeting to explode into a full  scale gossip like last year.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sit  down.” I told her as I sat myself on the bench-like rock under the  tree’s shade. It suddenly occurred to me that the way I had said  that didn’t seem very polite or nice at all. I must be very  nervous… I might be trying to scare her… even unconsciously, but  I don’t know why.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  took her time to stand and look around… needless to say, probably  her way of rebelling against my commanding requests, before sitting  down a good three feet away from me. I looked at her, but she didn’t  seem like she was going to look at me anytime soon. I am beginning to  wonder why I wanted to talk to her again... other than it was for  Hikari. Unfortunately the best reason that I could come up with was  ‘There’s something about her…’ what it was… is still very  vague to me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  just stared at her, examining her from head to toe. I noted that the  smile she held while we were in the cafeteria was gone, replaced by a  cold, sad, indifferent stare towards the sky. I found myself studying  her features; her lustrous raven hair was slightly unkempt showing  signs that she had barely been brushing it. Her mystifying amber eyes  were surrounded by dark circles under her eye lids, an obvious sign  of not sleeping enough or fatigue. Her cream colored skin seemed a  little pale. Sakura pink lips that were a little dry and showed some  signs of being chewed on. And a lovely figure, though I get this  feeling that she’s a little thinner than the last time I saw her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If  I had to describe the feeling she gives out, in a few words… I  would say she’s like a ‘Fallen Angel’. An angel, who had  committed a sin be it by her choice or otherwise, and was cast out of  heaven.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  be quite honest, I’m actually afraid or perhaps nervous to speak to  her right now. She’s giving me this feeling that she could attack  me at anytime. I almost deeply regret asking her to come and sit with  me, or at least the way I did… had I not done that would she be  reacting differently towards me? But then again, maybe I’m just  scaring myself here. I mean this person is Hikari’s friend… I  can’t imagine her having someone as scary as the person I’m  imagining as her friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a while, I began thinking that I was taking to long. She wasn’t  showing any signs that she was getting impatient… but then again  she wasn’t showing any signs at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So  I forced myself to say something; “I know our first meeting…”  However, I was so anxious that I couldn’t finish that sentence,  even though I thought the words seemed appropriate to start our  conversation. I had expected her to at least look at me or just do  something, but like moments ago she didn’t show any signs of  interest or disinterest in being here. She simply continued looking  out towards the sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then she opened her notebook. At first I thought she was going to  write something to say to me like; <em>‘What  did you drag me here for?’</em> or <em>‘I should get going’</em> or <em>‘Bye’</em>.  But to my surprise she began drawing. I slowly inched closer to her  and watched her skillful hands draw the scene of the school’s horse  ranch. I found myself admiring her work and learning something about  her. I was told that she was the choir’s ace, but now I see that  she has other talents… <em>‘I  wonder if Hikari knows that her best friend can draw this well.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  good at that.” I complemented her absently, continuing to watch her  hands gracefully dance on the notebook’s printed paper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  turned to look at me and gasped in surprise, dropping the notebook as  her body suddenly jumped away from me. She had lost her balance and  was falling to the ground. Thinking quickly, I caught her left wrist,  but I only managed to lessen the impact of her fall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  eyes were closed as she tried to recover from the pain. I didn’t  know why but her pained expression made me feel warm inside, it was  an odd feeling that I didn’t understand, at least not then. I then  noticed a wet feeling around my finger as I held her wrist, I almost  cried out as I saw that my nail had dug and scratched her skin  causing her to bleed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  bleeding.” I kneeled in front of her. I felt embarrassed somehow,  like I was being watched. But there wasn’t time for me to worry  about that now. I kissed her wrist, suckled and licked the wound to  get it clean. I had done this for myself and friends when we had to  wait for the first aid kit; I had simply acted like I usually do in  the given situation. But oddly enough, I felt very… happy to be  touching her like this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was surprised when she suddenly pulled her hand away. I looked up at  her, worried that she might have been in more pain. But instead I saw  an angry look in her eyes that almost felt like she could burn me  from the inside out. It took me a few seconds to notice the angry  snarl and a deep blush that accented just how angry she was… it was  then that a new concern came to me…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What  if she hates me? No! I don’t want her to hate me! ... Wait… why?’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  told myself; <em>‘</em><em>That  was a stupid question… Hikari’s best friend that’s why!’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Please  don’t hate me…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Was  that all there was to it?’</em> I asked myself, I felt more and more confused of how I thought of  this girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  in the end… all I could say to myself was; <em>‘I  don’t know…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>But  p</em><em>lease don’t hate me…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  thoughts alone passed thru my head quickly, I could feel my whole  being begging her or God not to hate me as I stared into her eyes. I  quickly decided that I had to apologize.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  offered my hand to help her stand up. “I’m sorry. I didn’t  mean…” but she just slapped my hand away, cutting off my attempt  to apologize to her. To say that I was surprised was an  understatement. I absently watched her stand up on her own, dust off  her uniform of the soil and dirt that got on it, and pick up her  notebook. She then looked at me… she just looked at me… staring  straight into my eyes, like I did hers. Our eyes locked for only a  few seconds, but it felt far longer than that. She then bowed; it was  the smallest bow I’ve seen… I feared that it meant &quot;goodbye!&quot;  I was correct in my fears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  my surprise, she sharply turned around and began walking away. Each  step she took made my chest feel heavier and tighter. It was  incredibly painful, like… like… I don’t really know what I  could compare it with. I didn’t know how or why. I have never met  anyone that could make me feel this way. Not wanting it to end like  that, I sprinted to catch up with her. When I did, I quickly placed  my hand and held onto her shoulder, crying out; “Wait a minute!”  almost begging her to stay.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  turns her head a little to the side and for a moment our eyes met  again. The same angry glow of her face was still there. Looking away  she immediately shrugs my hand off her and continues walking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please  wait! Yaya-san.” I desperately begged her to stop. I grabbed her  wrist not really noticing that it was her injured one yet, or maybe I  should say I had forgotten and didn’t care. All that mattered at  the moment was making her stay. I heard her notebook dully hit the  grass on the ground, but the sound was enough to make me realize that  she was shaking in pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  my horror she faced me again with that furious expression... I saw  her lips move and say; <u>“I…  hate… you.”</u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  silent words had hurt me more than the stinging pain that came after  when her right hand slapped me. I just stared at her. My lips  trembled as I held my left cheek. I wanted to say something, but I  couldn’t find the words. I was completely stunned, and didn’t  have the faintest idea what to do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  watched her turn around and head back to the school. I wanted to  catch her again, to apologize or at least try, but my legs wouldn’t  obey me. All I could do was watch her as she slowly stomped her way  back to the school while her blood occasionally tricked down from her  hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  fell on my knees when she was out of sight. I was out of it for a  while. My mind continuously replayed the moments when her lips moved  to say those painful words… over and over. It was the second time  that I’ve failed talking to her… and right now I felt like giving  up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a few moments, I heard footsteps approach me. I looked up to see  Fujino Shizuru, a classmate of mine, carrying a first aid kit. She  looked at me with a mixture of worry and intrigue that she didn’t  hide in the slightest. Behind her stood Kuga Natsuki, an  underclassman and a club mate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  guess I was right about the feeling of being watched.’</em> I said to myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  kneeled in front of me and checked my still very red cheek. “I’m  happy to see that there are actually still some people immune to your  charm, Amane-san.” She teased. I didn’t bother answering her.  Although I know that she means well, she just likes to be very  sarcastic about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  was that girl?” I heard Natsuki ask.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanto  Yaya.” Shizuru answered for me. “I believe she’s in the Saintly  Chorus. I’m sure you’ve seen her a few times.” She began wiping  a strong but pleasant smelling and cold ointment on my stinging  cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  but I don’t usually bother getting their member’s names.”  Natsuki began helping me up to my feet as soon as Shizuru had  finished.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then noticed the notebook that Nanto-san left. I picked it up and  stared at it absently, while my mind seemed to automatically replay  the events that had just transpired. I was probably looking for some  absolution, that it wasn’t me that caused her to angrily stomp  away, but I couldn’t find any.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was  it that bad a rejection?” Shizuru asked, any other day her sarcasm  wouldn’t have much of an effect on me nor would I consider  answering her seriously. But today, it did and I did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe…”  I mumbled softly causing Natsuki and Shizuru to look at me and then  each other, seemingly confused about my reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  opened the notebook, wondering what was in it. I saw the many things  that she had written; the greetings, apologies to Hikari, explanation  of her absence, answers to teacher’s question, and drawings… most  of which were crude and childish drawings, possibly made just to  waste time or to clear a train of thought. But some were exquisite  sketches wasted on thin notebook paper. I had hoped that there was  something that could explain her hostility against me. I was really  dying to know and I couldn’t simply let this go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  lead me back to the horse barn. Inside there is a room with two beds,  used by the ones who are on night duty for a few days.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should rest for a while.” Shizuru said as she pushes me down to one  of the beds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  fine.” I argued. It was almost time for classes and even though I  haven’t eaten lunch yet we should be getting back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  shaking you know.” Had she not mentioned it, I wouldn’t have  noticed that I was. I looked down at my hands and legs, and true  enough, I was shaking… very badly. “So just put your feet up a  while and lie down, while we wait for Natsuki to buy you some Lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  nodded in defeat. It’s not so bad to skip classes once in a while,  and I definitely don’t want anyone to see this slap mark. I’m  sure that everyone will make a big deal out of it. “Can you guys  keep what happened a while ago a secret?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shizuru  raised an eyebrow and looked at me inquisitively. “I guess so. But…  why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  frowning smile crept up my lips. “I don’t want to bring her  anymore trouble, I think she’s got enough problems already.” I  told them. It was true that I didn’t want to bring her more  trouble, and despite all that had happened I still want to get to  know her and maybe help her, like I did for Hikari.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  lost myself in thought for a while.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmmm…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  thought that I had been staring out at nowhere, but when I broke out  of my thoughts… I realized that Shizuru’s face was just inches  away from mine own and her eyes stared deeply into mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it…?” I asked, hoping that it would get her to stop staring at  me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  then asked, in a rather cold voice. “Are you serious about her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”  was the only response that came out, aside for the feeling of my  cheeks heating up. I was surprised at her question and didn’t quite  know how to respond. There was just something about Nanto-san that  made me feel odd. I can’t really explain it. For now the best that  I could probably describe it, is that I’m longing to see her, touch  her... I’m also a bit scared of her, and terrified that she’ll  hate me even more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm…”  she suddenly smiled. I hate it when she does that, it’s quite  creepy. “What about Konohana-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  could feel that she was trying to get at something, but she tends to  be vague about things she wants to say, not to mention sarcastic  about it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you getting at?” I asked her with an annoyed tone. I wish she  would just come right out and say it at times. ‘Why does she take  so much pleasure in toying with other people’s heads?’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  just saying… to choose the right one. You don’t want to hurt  either one right?” She gave me a reassuring smile then patted my  hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  wanted to tell her that it wasn’t like that… but knowing her  she’ll find a way to say that it is. Twisting my words enough to  make even myself believe that it were true. So I decided to simply  smile and nod to satisfy her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Natsuki  then came back with some sandwiches and a can of juice. I thanked her  and Shizuru for all they did for me. They left for class after that,  leaving me alone in the Horse Barn’s sleeping quarters with my  thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  pondered about Nanto-san a little more while I ate. I recalled that  Hikari did not really talk about Nanto-san all that much until she  lost her voice. The only information I knew is that they’re best  friends, that Nanto-san looks out for and supports her, and that  she’s the choir’s ace. Other than I know she can draw very well,  I knew nothing about her… What does she like? What’s her real  personality like? How did she act around Hikari before she lost her  voice? I could go on forever…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  woke up… realizing that I had drifted off to sleep, maybe it’s  from thinking too much.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Classes  should over by now, I felt a little bad for skipping, but then again,  I felt refreshed after that unplanned nap. So I guess it was ok. I  checked my face in the mirror and was glad that most of the redness  in my cheek had disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  then Natsuki re-entered the room, wearing her horse riding uniform  and carrying my bag. “I brought your things. How is your cheek?”  She didn’t really sound all that concerned, but that was simply how  Natsuki was: blunt, rude, but nice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  better now. Thank you.” She just nodded and placed the bag on the  bed. She left the room soon after saying that she would ride Duran,  her horse, again. I followed her out shortly, saddled Star Bright and  rode out to practice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was peaceful for a while; we were able to ride without the countless  squealing fans, which did not last long. Before I realized it there  were a lot of our schoolmates watching us. I tried my best to ignore  them, which was hard since I was also looking for Hikari among the  crowd.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Practice  ended without me seeing her. I rushed out of the stables to look for  Hikari soon after feeding Star Bright, but she wasn’t anywhere to  be found. A flood of terrible thoughts rushed into my head, as I sat  on the rock bench under the tree. Like <em>‘If Nanto-san told her  what I did.’ </em>or<em> ‘If Nanto-san was angry enough to slander me.’ </em>or<em> ‘What if that cut I accidentally gave her was worse than it  looked?...’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  would have gone on and on… but then I heard footsteps behind me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-sempai.”  I heard the angel’s call, rescuing me from my terrible thoughts. I  turned to see Hikari, with a sad smile on her face. And for a moment…  I forgot what I had been worrying about.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>To  be continued…</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Author’s  Notes</strong>: Yes! Fujino Shizuru  and Kuga Natsuki from Mai-Hime! Hehe ;; I originally thought to just  make names up… but having characters from other Animes making a  Cameo seemed much more fun! XD</span></p>
