<p>“That Amiki…”  Kaname complained. “To say she always does unnecessary things is to  make the understatement of the century.” </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just her way.”  Momomi ran a hand through her soaking wet hair. “I’ll admit,  though, this time she want a lot further than she had to. A discreet  cough would have been sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me about it. And  she insisted that we finish up without going back to change, damn  her.” Kaname shook out her hair, scattering drops of water  everywhere. “We could catch a cold, or worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, there’s  no correlation between getting cold and wet and actually catching a  cold…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I knew. That doesn’t  mean this is healthy for us, now does it?” Kaname rubbed her eyes  irritably. “Tell me we have a spare pair of uniforms in the room. I  don’t want to have to troop over to the office in sodden clothes  and try to explain this one…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We do, thankfully.  I’m always prudent. Aren’t you glad I’m around?” Momomi  smiled, resisting the temptation to hum to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d be gladder if  you didn’t befriend short-haired psychopaths who are on their  girlfriend’s list of employees.” Kaname shivered slightly. “I’m  cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Big, tough  Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, I was closer to  the door! I took most of the attack, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like a good,  protective male.” Momomi smiled when Kaname bridled. “But still,  that was a fairly close call. If the Etoiles had chosen that juncture  to make an inspection, we’d have been screwed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More than the  Etoiles, a Sister,” Kaname muttered gloomily. “Do you think  they’d buy it if we said she tripped?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Probably not.  But I guess we shouldn’t talk so loudly. We’re not safe until we  reach our room, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re nearly there.  But damn, am I cold. And wet.” Kaname hugged herself, shivering  again. “Can I take a shower?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No way. We don’t  have time for that, you know. We’re going to be late for rehearsal  as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  really careless, aren’t you? It’s alright for you, who didn’t  get <em>completely </em>soaked…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said, you’re  the tough girl, aren’t you? Bear with it, already, and don’t  complain too much. We can shower after rehearsal.” Momomi glanced  at her girlfriend, looking playful. “I’ll even shower with you if  that’ll make it up to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname returned her gaze  evenly. “You know, I might even take you up on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really? That’s  something to look forwards to.” Momomi stuck her hands in her  pockets, grinning cheekily. “But if that’s bribery to try and  push the shower time back, it won’t work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As ever, you’re  over-suspicious. And cruel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I must say, though,  being wet suits you,” Momomi remarked. “It goes with your ruffled  charm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Being wet really  doesn’t suit you, though. It makes you look like a half-drowned  cat.” Kaname grimaced. “Under the circumstances, I’ll forgive  myself for taking the brunt of the offensive…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How cruel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They say honesty is a  Christian virtue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There was nothing  Christian about what you were doing with your tongue earlier… I was  quite impressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not so loud! We’re  in public, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still boring,”  Momomi pouted, turning and opening the door to their room. Kaname  brushed past her, stripping off her blazer and tossing it on her bed.  “Hey, don’t put it there! You’ll get the bed wet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who cares about  that?” Kaname queried, unbuttoning her shirt. “I just want to get  the hell out of these clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And as ever, I have  to clean up after your mess. I’m always the woman, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That again! Are you  obsessed or what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. It just  gets a rise out of you, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, don’t be too  shocked when I finally grow breasts, okay? I’m not a man in  disguise, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Any time you feel  like doing that is fine by me, Kaname,” Momomi teased. “Though  people of your type are supposed to be flat chested for life, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. So that is what  you want…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. I’m  preparing myself for disappointment, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish I had such a  convenient way out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi picked up her  shirt and blazer, placing them on the radiator. She shrugged off her  own jacket and added it to the pile, before turning back to Kaname as  she rooted through the wardrobe. “Throw me my spare blazer, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.” Kaname  tossed it casually over her shoulder without looking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi barely caught it,  frowning deeply. “As ever, you’re extremely careless. Have you  got any idea how expensive these things are?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. I’ve  never had to pay for one, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you call yourself  the financially prudent amongst the two of us… third world  countries have been bartered for a handful of these, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Amane’s ridden  a horse to the moon, I’m sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, with all the  stellar names she has for her horses, I wouldn’t be too surprised.”  Momomi frowned. “Did I ever tell you about Ganymede?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The fact that Amane’s  horse is named after a moon of Jupiter and also Zeus, or Jupiter’s,  gay lover?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. That fact,”  Momomi replied, sounding vaguely disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think so,  no. What can I say? That girl has strange tastes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. That’s  certainly true enough… it has a nice ring to it, though. I’ll  admit that much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, tucking  her new shirt in and reaching for another necktie. “Honestly, she  should use less pretentious names, like… I don’t know… Kiko or  Shouta or something. That way her stable wouldn’t so obviously  advertise the ridiculous amount of money involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Horses need good,  poetic names. It’s the only way to justify the price tag, after  all.” Momomi smiled. “Ganymede was a little unfortunate, though.  But it’s appropriate to this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sappho would be more  appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi raised her  eyebrows. “Your knowledge of Greek myth and history is surprisingly  good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Serané  told me that it’d come up on the scholarship exams for second year.  Actually, that didn’t get past Kariya, she just likes Greek stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “My,  that does sound like her. And undoubtedly she smiled very innocently,  too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, of course. It was  interesting, though. Any religion which tacitly condones serial  adultery has my full attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Try that on me and  you’ll understand the meaning of being driven mad, then destroyed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got it, already.  You’re far scarier than Hera was, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked, running  a hand through her hair and turning to face Kaname. “Damn right.  Now, shall we go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname pulled her blazer  into place, looked up, and nodded. “Sure. Let’s knock them dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’ve come  again?” A sigh. “You’re very persistent.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Not particularly.  I didn’t come here for me. I came here for you.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They set off, heading towards the  drama studio. Momomi stuck her hands in her pockets, humming slightly  to herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re in a good  mood,” Kaname noted. “Have you been doing something beyond my  back again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again? When did I  ever do anything behind your back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… how do I put  this… you act unilaterally an awful lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah. But it’s  not like I really deceive you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You just make sure  you don’t tell me the full facts, right? Because that’s so very  different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s true,  as far as it goes. But that’s also natural.” Momomi glanced  sidelong at Kaname. “How about you? Surely you hide things from me  as well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s face slipped  slightly. “Well, yeah, I guess…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. You’re no  different, so don’t complain too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just because we both  do it, doesn’t mean it’s the right thing to do, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? Kaname standing  up for moral absolutes? I never thought that would happen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just saying. I  also think we shouldn’t act in those ways people call right anyway.  But that doesn’t necessarily mean what we do is right, does it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There are many kinds  of right in this world, no? Ours is ‘right for us’. That’s all  we need to worry about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just as long as what  we do is right for us…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s up with  you?” Momomi demanded sulkily. “I’m in a good mood, but you’re  being really gloomy all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just thinking.  Something you do less of the happier you get.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m always thinking  a lot, thank you very much. My thoughts aren’t as warped by  emotions as yours are.” Momomi turned her head, looking at her  girlfriend with a wry smile. “But I’m happy right now, so I’ll  forgive you. Let’s work hard, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Work hard? Don’t  screw with me.” Kaname grinned. “We’ll ice-skate on our  talents, the same way we always have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>For me?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>It’s written on  your face, isn’t it?” A chuckle. “You may call that mask  perfect, but it’s never fooled me. You’re very, very troubled.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If that’s the  case, I don’t think you are someone who can ease any of my  troubles.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know. But I’m  here all the same. That’s who I am.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hopefully,  we’ll finally get to do <em>our </em>scenes  in that blasted play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our chance to shine,  huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Of  course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you know, I’ve  been thinking, and doesn’t this whole portray you as something of  an idiot?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Orsino was an  idiot from the beginning, so I can accept that case… in your case,  though, you fall head over heels for Amane, or should I say Viola?  However, it quickly emerges that I’ll do instead, especially as  Viola just happens to be a girl. Either Sebastian is one heck of a  bishie or you’re just fickle. Heck, even if I’m a bishie, that  still makes you pretty fickle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. You’re  identical twins, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t have  identical twins of different sexes. That isn’t identical, by  default.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, close enough as  to make no difference.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There are  differences, though. For a start, Viola is a smooth operator and  confidence trickster who can pass for a boy and not only fool, but  seduce, a duchess. Sebastian, on the other hand, is an idiot who  barely has the wit to take fate’s equivalent of a straight flush  and run with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Considering Viola was  meant to seduce said duchess for her master, and she massively failed  at that, I think you overstate her competence. Especially as she  couldn’t reject Olivia in the aftermath, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even with that, at  least Viola achieves something, instead of riding on her sibling’s  cross-dressing tendencies and luck.” Kaname shrugged. “Well, put  it down to gender differences. Either way, it’s a classic twins  story. The twins are considered interchangeable by the other person,  who is therefor shallow and disgusts the twins. Only Sebastian’s  too preoccupied by Olivia’s breasts to be disgusted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think you’re  overanalysing this, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You think? That’s  not important. It’s an interesting point, all the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,”  Momomi conceded. “But really, can you blame any of them? Coming  second is better than coming last, and Olivia is a hot young duchess  of great wealth… you do the mental maths.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This thinking from  the person who despises arranged marriages?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’d think the  same way if I was given a chance-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s such a  double standard. You really are a rebel without a cause…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If it wasn’t for,  so to speak, who I am. You should let me finish before criticising  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? So if you were  Viola, you’d go after Olivia after all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi touched her lip.  “Hmm. Probably. I doubt I’d get anywhere in those times, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know you know.  But you know that as well, and it goes on…” She leaned back and  looked up at the sky, sighing. “Or has all that changed? Can we  really claim to know each other that well any more?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No. That hasn’t  changed.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A wry smile. “I  wish I could believe you when you say that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They opened the door and stepped  through.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You two! What time do  you call this?” Eida demanded, gesturing irritably. “Don’t you  have any pride at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “Sorry.  Something came up… we came as quick as we could.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehh? Hang on, what’s  with the hair?” Eida sniffed. “You didn’t waste your time  washing your hair or something stupid, did you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, of course not.  Didn’t Amiki and Olesa tell you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me what.” Eida  frowned. “No, forget it. I don’t care any more. Shut up and sit  down, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “So  what are we doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hirai  shuffled through her notes. “Uhm… you’re working on Act Four  Scene One, with Nagasawa-san, Tou-san and Uemura-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly, is she the  only one who knows what is going on around here?” Kaname asked  quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, shush. Look on  the bright side. It’s our turn, now. Together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked around as  she walked towards the group they’d been assigned. “No Amane  today. That’s unusual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grunted, looking  round the room herself. “Hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry. It is? You  could fool me. That girl’s never where she’s supposed to be…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I guess so,”  Momomi admitted. “But still, she was pretty enthusiastic when we  started working on this play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know what she’s  like. A short attention span for anything but horses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But still, even  though it’s arrogant of me to try and take credit for these things,  it feels like my failure.” Momomi sighed. “And it also feels like  everything Amane’s gained in recent times has been lost again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not your  fault. If you want to be like that, you can, but it still isn’t  your fault.” Kaname put her hands in her pockets. “What about us?  Even though we were in a far worse position, we became proactive  about things like this. If Amane, of all people, doesn’t get  involved, that’s her choice and her fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that. You  don’t have to tell me that. But, all the same… it doesn’t make  me happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>In any case, if  you’ve come about that…I’ve decided.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Oh? Not about my  longstanding question, I presume…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That was settled  long ago. You know that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Hope springs  eternal. But don’t take me too seriously. I’m more worried  because you’ve made the worst possible decision again, haven’t  you?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’ve made the  responsible decision.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yeah. I was afraid  it would come to that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was seven minutes  after they’d arrived that Koike turned up, with a casual air, as if  being late was the most natural thing in the world. She accepted  criticism without flinching, moving to her place with her script in  hand. But she caught Momomi’s eye briefly as she crossed the room.  Momomi caught the implicit message there. Even so, it was ten minutes  later that Amane turned up and forty minutes from the break prior to  performances, where she stood, waved Kaname away and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’ll be glad,  I suppose. Though I’m not quite sure why.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m not glad.  Please do me a little more credit than that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’re right.  I’m sorry.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That’s unusual.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Ah?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You don’t  apologise a lot, you know. In fact, it’s very rare, even though  you’re famed as being such a courteous person. Isn’t that  ironic?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’d like to say  that’s because I never have any reasons to apologise, but I don’t  think that’s true.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A chuckle. “I see.  You know, I was a little worried, but you haven’t changed at all.  Underneath it all.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Ah.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike stepped out into  the corridor, smirking at Momomi. “Is it okay? To be here instead  of with your insecure little girlfriend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right back at you,  minus the girlfriend. Well, not that she ever has much to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh. So you found out,  huh?” Koike leaned against the wall. “It’s no biggie. Everyone  but you knows anyway, that’s the kind of school we live in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Frustrated?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly. It’s just  natural. Further, it’s something I can make use of. That’s why I  know so much about you, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Certainly, rumour is  a wonderful thing.” Momomi folded her arms. “We really are more  than a little alike. As much as it pains me to admit that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can echo that  sentiment, and its caveat.” Koike yawned. “But really, when I  realise I’m on the same level as you I notice I’m such a pathetic  girl, for all my pretences and pride.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I struggle to  equate someone like you with a person as elevated as I am. Is that  the difference between us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean arrogance? I  hope not, because I’m terribly arrogant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I meant self-esteem.  You don’t have a lot of that, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t joke around,  pretending to be a psychologist. I’m a perfectly assured person,  thank you very much. I’m just aware of the ridiculousness of the  world in general, and especially all the people in it.” Koike  shrugged with one hand. “You appear to dodge that issue in your  head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I hold myself  apart from it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that the  ultimate example of egotism, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled.  “Perhaps. But I think everyone has to be a little egotistical, to  be a healthy person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’re a healthy  person? I despair for humanity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re pretty  sick. But that’s a conversation for another time.” Momomi glanced  at her. “That’s enough word games for now, don’t you think? You  said, when you first met me, that you had a lot to say to the Phareli  child. I’m here to listen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, that’s right,  isn’t it?” Koike smirked. “That feels like a surprisingly long  time ago… but that’s fine. We’re here now, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It took you long  enough. But you’re always someone who takes the indirect approach,  aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I just like to  make sure that things are interesting before I begin. But things have  become very interesting indeed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>But that’s hardly important, is it? As far as  we’re concerned, that’s all in a past that died a long time ago.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Ah…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’re making a  mistake, though.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>There’s no  mistake. Whether or not this is what you want, there’s no mistake  at all. That doesn’t have anything to do with you or your agenda.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’re always  the one who sacrifices yourself, aren’t you? For what end?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>For a lot of  things. But mostly their feelings. That’s not something I  understand, but still, after she said those things so many times…I  understand now. It isn’t something to play with, the way you like  to play games. I should never have taken it so far, and I’ll end it  now.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>For their  feelings… sounds cool? Do you get a kick out of saying that?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>How about your  feelings? Don’t they matter anymore?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Compared to that,  my own feelings are unimportant. In any case, it’s the right thing  to do.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Stop being so  reasonable about this!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Sorry?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Don’t joke  around! Why aren’t you being selfish? You’ve done it before,  haven’t you? You can put your own feelings about those of others.  So why are you being so damn gentle with a girl who tried to use you  and the girl who wants you dead? Where’s the sense in that?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m a little  wiser than before. That’s all.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “Well, quite.  You’ve been playing around with Amane, haven’t you? Well, it’s  not like you don’t have a motive for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve said this  before, but I don’t play around. Or, at least, not with  Amane-chan.” Koike shrugged. “I just offered her advice, which  she completely rejected. No more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Advice? What kind of  advice?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not going to  tell you. It has nothing to do with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s a damn  convenient line to use to hide your sins…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane doesn’t want  you to know, either. If you’re asking me, that’s definite. How  about you?” Koike’s gaze met Momomi’s evenly. “Aren’t you  just trying to use me to go behind Amane’s back? That’s very  honourable of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You, of all people,  have nothing to say to anyone about honesty.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s true.  But what are you going to do, Phareli-san? Blackmail me? Threaten me?  Or perhaps a trade? Information is power, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “As if  I’d ever go that far. But isn’t this just a little sad? She  rejected you long ago. Can’t you move on and hope for her  happiness? Or would that be too reasonable for someone like you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Without going any  further than what I’m about to say, yes, that is what I want for  her.” Koike leaned back, shrugging again. “I told her as much,  with different words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes. Of course,  there’s more to it than that. There’s more to everything than  that. But I do hate people who try and reduce situations to romantic  clichés. True feelings are more complicated than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes, yes. But  occasionally things really are simple. At the basic level, words like  ‘I love you’ are that simple.” Momomi leaned forwards slightly.  “You understand that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A phrase like that is  very simple and very complicated at the same time. But we won’t  talk semantics here, of all places.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If it helps at all, Kenjou isn’t pulling any  punches. She’ll lie to Phareli’s face, cheat, conspire and use  blackmail, something, anything…for her, it’s a forgone  conclusion. She doesn’t want you near Phareli, in any respect. So  you don’t have to feel mercy for someone like that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>It doesn’t  matter. I’m deferring to her selfish feelings, as her feelings are  stronger.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>And you? You’re  just going to retreat into that shell again? Oh, I’m sure you’ll  become a champion rider, but where’s the meaning in that? You like  her, don’t you? Won’t you at least admit it?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I like her.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>So, then-”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>So nothing.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Why are you so  stubborn?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If an emotion  isn’t returned, it isn’t returned.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Even if you say  that, isn’t it just too feeble and pathetic? Shouldn’t you at  least struggle?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You know the  answers to all those questions. But it isn’t pathetic. Never  pathetic. It’s just an unfortunate truth…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You don’t have  the right to say that, you know. Not after how you treated me.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know.” A sigh.  “I know.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But this is a good  time to talk. You like Kenjou, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. You like  Amane. So what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So nothing… but  it’s different for you. She’s someone who can make you happy, for  as long as you two are together. What I think of you two don’t come  into that, it’s just the way it is. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s what  liking someone means.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hardly. That, too, is  an oversimplification…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be pedantic.  You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do. So I’ll cut  against my own grain and ask you, why are you also sacrificing  yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sacrificing myself?  Would I really do anything so melodramatic?” Momomi laughed. “I  don’t recall doing anything so pure-hearted in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why bother to spend  time exclusively with Amane-chan when you could be with Kenjou for  that time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. Jealously finally  takes hold…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t patronise me.  This has nothing to do with jealousy, as I don’t have any chance  anyway. You should know, talking to her.” Koike glanced at her  irritably. “So if you’re done with strawman arguments, you can  answer my question.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I have a lot of  reasons. But I don’t really have any particular desire to tell  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so? Then I’ll  guess, then.” Koike leaned further back, looking bored. “At  first, it was obviously a ploy in your relationship crisis with  Kenjou. You got away with it because you have a confident manner  about you, and I happen to know Amane is rather open to that  attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you should  know, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case,” Koike  continued sharply. “That obviously fell down after a while. But you  stayed on and even tried to move closer. Why? To annoy Kenjou a  little? To gain even further from Amane’s reputation? To satisfy  your own pride and curiosity? Or would you even go so far as to pity  Amane, for the way she lived? Perhaps you thought you were special,  even, someone who was uniquely equipped to reach her. Whatever the  reason, you were arrogant in the extreme.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And now you’re just  bitter. Is this all there is? I’m bored already. Shall I go back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>So you’re backing off? Where’s the sense in  that? That’s not going to please Phareli either!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Well, you should  know. I find that situation difficult.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That was in bad  taste.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>It wasn’t a  joke…but never mind. This is for the best, for all of us. Even if I  continue, I won’t be happy. Nor will Kenjou. And while she may be  happy in the short time, I don’t think those two facts will allow  her to stay satisfied forever. And if it’s a question of which of  us matters more, there’s no doubt.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You sure claim to  know everything. But why are you the one who gets to say what’s  best for everyone? You’re just making an arbitrary decision without  even consulting her! What’s the point in that?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That’s something  you do as well, isn’t it?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>What does that  have to do with anything? That’s no excuse at all!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’re right, of  course. That doesn’t have anything to do with the matter in hand.  But for myself, as with yourself, this is something I’ve chosen to  do.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>If she knew, she’d  call you stupid, or worse. You know that.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know. But I’d  rather be at peace with myself than with her. Is that strange?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Yes. Very.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I don’t think  so. But this is the way things are. Sometimes, actions which would  make people happy in the short term are only going to hurt them in  the long run.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I never asked you  to pretend. I would never forgive you for pretending to me, but-”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No. Even when I  was cruel, the same logic applied. Because I am not a kind person at  heart, so I must be cruel to be kind. That’s why.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Living like that,  you’re just pushing your flaws onto the rest of us, instead of  changing.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Like I said, I’ve  never pretended to be kind.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In a minute. You’re right  insofar as there isn’t a lot left to say, but I should give you  fair warning.” Koike pushed off the wall, standing and taking a  step forwards. “Amane’s going to become more distant from you  now. She’ll probably tell you soon, but she may just let it happen.  Either way, there’s no point in struggling about it. This is just  the way things are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What did I do?”  Momomi demanded, stepping forwards. “Damnit, I thought this might  happen, but what the hell am I supposed to have done? How much more  does she want from me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not my fault  or hers. It’s my crime and my responsibility. I arranged things so  they’d turn out this way.” Koike stuck her hands in her pockets,  cocking her head casually. “So if you want to hate someone for  this, hate me. It isn’t anything you’ve done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked,  frowning. “That’s surprisingly unconvincing… but if it is  something you’ve said, I’ll undo it. I can do something that  simple. I’m not done just yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no point.  I’ve brought her around to my point of view, and when she’s truly  set herself on something there is no turning back. You shouldn’t  waste your breath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what did you do?  Last I heard, you only gave advice. What kind of advice was that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think?”  Koike shrugged, turning away. “In any case, trying to change this  fate would take energy. You need that for your relationship with  Kenjou. Isn’t she enough for you? If you chase after two pretty  birds, they’ll both get away from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve never told  you, Koike. But I have a life philosophy, a very selfish one.”  Momomi folded her arms. “If you want something, take it. Take  everything freely, no matter what it costs. That’s why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike snorted. “Well,  that’s the daftest thing I’ve heard in quite some time…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’re as immovable as ever.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Sorry.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Don’t apologise  for the little things. It reminds me of everything you’ll never  apologise for.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m sorry for  that, as well.” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Idiot… but you  have somewhere to be, don’t you? The play’s rehearsal. Or have  you lost interest in that, as well?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No, I’ll go.”  She turned to look up at the sky. “You go on ahead first.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Okay. Later.” A  few footsteps, then a pause, and she turned briefly. “Amane, I  meant to tell you this last time…but whatever I do and say, some  things haven’t changed. I still love you.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know. But would  it really help if I apologised?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Idiot…”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, Koike?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike stopped. “What?  We’re late already, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just want to say  that I’m someone who is in a better position than most to  understand you, and the fact that you’re a complete bitch is  independent of my sympathy for you.” Momomi smiled. “It isn’t a  nice situation to be in, I know that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Do you really  think you can afford to pity me? Don’t make me feel ill.” Koike  glared. “I may be unfortunate, Phareli, but I’ll have to fall a  thousand times further before I’ll even think of accepting your  sympathy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know that. So I’m  still going to think of you as a stuck-up, meddling bitch with a  superiority complex.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a lot  better. I just want to say, while we’re on the subject, that if we  met under different circumstances we would probably completely hate  each other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “You  know, I feel the same way as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I’ll see you  later, Phareli. Good luck coping with Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good luck to you,  too. Any time you notice other girls instead of chasing a shadow of a  shadow of a dream, that’d be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.” Koike  sighed and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname stepped towards  Momomi the moment she re-entered, face tight. “Just what did you  say to her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just stuff about  Amane,” Momomi replied. “It wasn’t very important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wasn’t very  important? It took you long enough, and worried me enough, damnit!  You could at least tell me-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi touched her face.  “It wasn’t important, okay? Not important like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “That  just worries me even more…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More importantly, we’ll be  performing up there shortly, right. So I’ll test you.” Momomi  smirked. “What’s the penultimate line of act four?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  easy.” Kaname grabbed her hand, lowering it and looking into  Momomi’s eyes. “<em>I'll follow this good man,  and go with you; and, having sworn truth, ever will be true.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  nodded. <em>“Then lead the way, good father; and  heavens so shine,</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That they may fairly  note this act of mine!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite.” Kaname dropped her  hand and turned away, smiling to herself. “Hopefully, act wasn’t  referring to your theatre. That isn’t anything to ask God to look  at it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And I certainly can’t  credit you with swearing anything but four-letter words,” Momomi  retorted. “Sadly, we’ll have to make do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.” Kaname  looked critically at Momomi. “Hmm. Could be worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Yep.  Could be worse…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No matter what happened,  there could always be worse things than this.</span></p>
