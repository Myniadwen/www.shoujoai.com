<p>“Now, just sit down and take a good, long rest. It’s alright to cry if you want to, too.”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pulled out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes furiously, determined to stop crying as soon as possible. <em>I don’t even know why I ended up like this. It’s not like this is the end of the world, or anything. </em>“Don’t  worry,” she said aloud, looking up at Serané through moist eyes, her  mouth a grim slash. “I don’t intend… to gratify your feelings like this  for much longer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané sighed and smiled wanly. “Crying is very  healthy when you need to vent, Momomi-chan, and no one will think any  the worse of you because of it. It’s best to let everything out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Easy for you to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  way you’ll prevent further embarrassment later, too,” Serané said.  “Isn’t it best to release your emotional tension all at once, in a  secure environment?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Momomi admitted, disarmed by  this logic. She sat on the bottom step of the clock tower, looking  forlornly up at the Etoile. “But don’t either of you dare tell anyone  about this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry. We’ll be completely confidential.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t suppose you’re going to leave me alone. That’s all I want to be, okay? Just give me some time alone, I’ll be fine!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  right,” Kariya said. “As if we can do that after what you just did. We  have a duty, you know, to help students in need. Whether they like it  or not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s to say,” Serané said quickly, “that we’ll always  be there for you when you need us, and supporting you. We are  personally responsible for the welfare, physical and emotional, of  every person in this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As much as the Superior is,” Kariya continued. “And practically, far more so. We’re the women on the ground, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is all a longwinded way of saying that you won’t leave me alone, even if I want you to, isn’t it?” Momomi said sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  knelt in front of her, eyes steady and earnest. “If you can convince us  that it is in your best interests that we leave you alone, we will  leave you alone. That’s what we have at heart. But if it wouldn’t  strain you too much, we’d like an account, of the situation. No, even  if it strains you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why the hell should I do that? This isn’t  something I’m going to talk about, least of all to you. This is my  private life! Respect that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please be reasonable,  Kiyashiki-chan,” Kariya said, standing behind her partner. “It’s  important that you tell us what’s going on. We can help you, and you  should know that when I want something done, I get it done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t want your help! If I can’t sort out my own life, then I certainly  don’t want anyone else to do so! I don’t want to be saddled with any  debt like that, at any cost.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At any cost?” Kariya queried, raising her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s  eyes fell for a moment, and she paused before she replied. “Well, it’s  not like you guys can do anything to help anyway… so forget it already…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if we leave you be, which is what we might decide to do, we can be  here,” Serané said, taking one of Momomi’s hands. “We can listen to  you, whatever you have to say, and we won’t think any the worse of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Truthfully,  there’s nothing you can say which we haven’t gone through ourselves at  one point or another,” Kariya said, shrugging slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can well believe that,” Momomi muttered, smiling slightly. “But all the same… I’m fine on my own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  red-head folded her arms, looking irritated. “Sometimes there are more  important things than dignity. You should remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya,”  Serané said in her warning voice. “Please go and talk to Perez-san and  Rivera-san. We need to know what they know as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll do  that, and leave this to you,” Kariya said without offence. But she  couldn’t resist one last parting shot as she left. “You know, though… I  always did hope that you’d find Kenjou-kun someone worth being upset  over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s this got to do with Kaname?” Momomi demanded a little too forcefully, her fists balling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a feeling,” Kariya shrugged. She waved idly with one hand then stepped through the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Forgive  Kariya, she tends to be a little… forceful, in situations like this,”  Serané said, smiling apologetically. “It’s her impatience, with others  and herself. But she us right, you know, this isn’t likely to be  anything we haven’t experienced for ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know about anything?” Momomi looked away, tapping her hand on her knee.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  now, Momomi-chan. It’s the height of teenage arrogance to think that  your feelings are unique in the annuls of history, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you have to say that now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  no other time,” Serané continued. “Momomi-chan is a very prickly  personality who always stands on her dignity, so she wants to be  reminded of these things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do not stand on my dignity!” Momomi replied, raising her face and trying to get some decent anger into her voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Serané said innocently. “So why not talk to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané put a hand on her shoulder. “Don’t force yourself, Momomi-chan. But I think it would be good for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Call  me Kiyashiki-san again,” Momomi said, frowning weakly. “It sounds like  you’re the one forcing yourself, when you call me Momomi-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe  you’re right,” Serané admitted, smiling. “Truthfully, I’m not very good  at this, you see. But I have to try. Because I’m an Etoile like Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, she’d be even worse. Don’t worry too much…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t underestimate my Kari-chan,” Serané said, cocking her head and smiling unabashedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled despite herself. “Kari-chan? Now you really are forcing yourself…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what I call Kariya in private, of course. I don’t know what you think  of me, Kiyashiki-san, but not even I would call my lover “san”. But I  have to keep up appearances, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And she calls you… what was it? Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  blushed slightly. “Well, yes. She’s a little more open than I am. She  said to me once, that a foreigner at this school should use a proper  name. We were both young and stupid at the time, but those words came  back to haunt us. I suppose the old, bigoted her would approve of your  integrationism.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bigoted? It’s not like you to speak badly of her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  back then I was the most terrible snob. We were young and stupid,  Kiyashiki-san. Not at all like you, I’m sure. But why did you change  your name, anyway? I’ve always been curious about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momomi’s  my given name, my real given name… that’s a pact my mother struck with  my father, because my sister has a European name. My surname’s my  mother’s maiden name. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, but why did you decide to use that name, not Phareli?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I hate my father,” Momomi said instinctively. “Probably.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see. That’s a shame.” Serané sounded sincere. “But we’ve wandered a  little off the subject. Kariya’s actually quite good at dealing with  these things. Oh, she has a terrible bedside manner, and she always  says it’s your weakness and that you should just get up and get on with  it, and it’s terribly insensitive, but…” she smiled in fond  remembrance. “Somehow it’s comforting. She sounds sure and confident  that it gives you strength to carry on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For you, maybe. I doubt that works on anyone else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’d  be surprised, I think,” Serané said quietly. “But certainly it worked  on me. I used to cry an awful lot, on my very first day, even… and even  on my very first day, she was there to tell me I was a stupid, weak,  useless brat who should run home crying to her mother.” She smiled.  “With retrospect, those were wonderful words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re just plain bizarre, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so, but it works on people other than me, as well. How about you, Kiyashiki-san? How do you try to comfort people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t, not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané raised her eyebrows. “Not even once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shifted uncomfortably, then broke. “Well, maybe once or twice…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what did you do then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hugged her,” Momomi whispered. “And then I… and then I-” She bowed her  head again, screwing up her eyes to prevent herself from crying.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry. I made you recall an unpleasant memory.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine,” Momomi said, controlling herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know what you’re doing, by the way,” she said after a while.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  trying to establish a rapport,” Momomi muttered. “By lowering your own  defences and telling me about yourself, you hope that I’ll return the  favour. And you talk in a friendly way about nothing in particular,  too, to try and win me over. It’s not going to work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t expect such simple tricks to work on someone like me. I know about manipulating people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  You characterise things in very negative ways, Kiyashiki-san,” Serané  said dryly. “Every time anyone says anything, they <em>manipulate </em>that person’s thoughts and feelings, in one sense of the word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not the same. Deliberately misleading someone is definitely different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not misleading you anywhere, though. I just want you to talk to me, for  both our sakes, and even if you don’t do that, I want to ease your  pain. If that requires manipulation, I’ll do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re still  just messing with my emotions using pretty words, and trying to get  what you want from me. I told you, I won’t be fooled by things like  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because you do it yourself?” Serané asked. She waited for  a few moments, then relaxed and smiled. “You need to take yourself less  seriously, Kiyashiki-san, and me too. If saying the right thing at the  right time is manipulation, then everyone does it. And it’s a good  thing too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not always,” Momomi muttered. <em>I’d put this girl in her place if I was feeling better, but I’m tired right now. So…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course,” Serané said. “But at the base, manipulation or more normal  emotional interaction both… they’re based on empathy and social  understanding. I’ve met some very manipulative people in my time,  Kiyashiki-san, and you are well on your way to being one of them, but  they’re also very vulnerable at heart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right. These are exceptional circumstances, you know… don’t think I’m always this weak.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t have to see emotion as weakness,” Serané said. “It teaches you  what other people can feel. I’ve always been far more worried by those  who don’t release their pain like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, spare your amateur psychology for someone who’d be interested. I could care less. I just don’t want to look stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a very human desire,” Serané said diplomatically. “But remember that  your understanding of people doesn’t have to be a bad thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say that as if I was a normal person, but I’m not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say that is you’re some kind of monster.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  the hell do you know?” Momomi sighed bitterly. “Perhaps I do  understand, but really I just understand superficial things without  feeling, and all I can do is control people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t believe  that. You said it yourself; you’ve comforted people before. Even if it  hurts you to think of that now… no, especially because it hurts to  think of that now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t talk about me as if you know me!”  Momomi hugged her knees, trying to find words. “I can’t empathise or  befriend, okay? So stop talking like I have some wonderful gift! All I  ever do is hurt people!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one just hurts people,” Serané said.  “There are always people who are important to you, and who consider you  important. Even if you hurt them, you bring them joy as well. That’s  very human as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it doesn’t apply to me. None of it! I  can’t say I’ve ever had a true friend, but I use people. It makes me  feel safe and secure so I jerk them around like puppets. But I don’t  bring joy, and people can’t help but hate me if I ever show them who I  am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Saying those things is fairly foolish,” Serané said, her  face set. “It may sound cool to write yourself off as a curse on  humanity, and it may help you cope with pain and loneliness, but it’s  not true and it’s just over-simplification. An excuse for the inaction  which can cradle you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hate that about you,” Momomi snapped  back. “You just sit there and think you know everything! You barely  know me and you certainly can’t say what’s true of all humanity!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you don’t disagree with me,” Serané said reasonably. “I don’t think  you’re ready to mentally consign yourself to the damned just yet.  Besides, how about Kenjou-san? She likes your company.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, not any more! I was practically talking about her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So your argument really was with her, not just Perez-san,” Serané sighed. “I was afraid that might be the case.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Kaname hates me now,” Momomi said in a low voice. “That’s all there is to it. I don’t intend to talk about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you’re just going to accept that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  surprised, that’s all. You’re strong and determined, Kiyashiki-san, a  lot more so than I am. You intend to take on your father because you  love this school and want to stay here. Is that someone who will just  accept being hated by their friend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s not my friend, she never was!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a bad idea to mistake the protective dishonesty of vulnerable people  like Kenjou-san with sincerity,” Serané said. “She was your friend,  even I can see that much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks can be deceptive. She just  stayed with me because of the things she hates. Olesa, Amiki, Amane, my  father. She can only define herself by the things she hates.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Were you really taken in by an act like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t an act. What do you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  simple logic. Either Kenjou-san is a demon who only feels hate… or  Kenjou-san is a vulnerable person who likes to pretend she’s hateful  because it protects her pride and her emotions. No?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi ground her teeth in frustration. “Say what you like!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t intend to be cruel, even now,” Serané said. “But I don’t like it  when people distort who they or other people are. I still wonder,  though, why you so simply accept her so-called hate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what the hell should I do, then? Go crawling back to her? That won’t fix anything!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can always go back on her terms. I’m sure she’ll listen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Saying  things like that, so freely… being so naïve… it’s so annoying! Listen  to me, damnit! You don’t know anything about Kaname and you don’t know  anything about me! I don’t want you to pretend you’re a fairy  godmother. That’s the worst distortion at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I’m wrong, prove me wrong. But you’ll have to tell your story.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t need to prove anything to you,” Momomi said. “I don’t want to be  interrogated. I just want to be alone. Is that so hard to understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s really what you want, then I will leave you,” Serané said. “But can I say one thing first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi closed her eyes. “Shoot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname  was your friend. I don’t know why you fell out or how bad it was or  when this happened, but if it’s possible, you should definitely talk to  her.” Serané’s eyes were steady. “These things are more important than  pride and dignity and comfort. If it’s hard to do, it’s probably the  right thing to do. It may hurt now, but unless you fight, unless you do  everything within your power to get her back, you might live in the  shadow of your momentary failure for months or years. And that’s far  more painful in the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her for a few moments, then opened her mouth-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And if you say a variant on <em>what do you know </em>one more time, I’ll be very unhappy,” Serané said, smiling again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  closed her mouth and sighed. “You might be right, but… it’s impossible.  I can’t know whether there’s any point in trying and I can’t bring  myself to try. More than that, I don’t know why I should have to be the  one to do this. I’m not the best person in the world, but I didn’t  deserve what I received, and I don’t have to do anything about it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do?  Nothing!” Momomi did her best to keep eye contact. “I don’t need  Kaname, and she doesn’t need me. If things are like this we’re only  going to hurt ourselves, and I’m not sure whether I want to know her  anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a pity,” Serané murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi carried on, annoyed. “You might understand, but you don’t <em>feel</em>!  Not like this! You can’t feel what it’s like for me right now, when I  hate myself because she hates me and I hate her because I doesn’t  deserve this and I’m sad for us both and I’m angry because she was so  unfair and said so many things that shouldn’t have been said, and  ashamed because I was just the same and afraid of what she might say  when I see her next and pained because… because I thought she was my  friend… and…” Momomi touched her eyes. “I’m crying again, aren’t I?  It’s too hard. Can’t you accept that, already? There’s no pride in it  any more. I just can’t do it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll hate for this… but I think I understand,” Serané said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi just put her head in her hands and said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When did this happen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A few hours,” Momomi replied in a monotone. <em>I  don’t even have the strength to resist anymore. Serané’s right… what’s  happened to me? I’m me; I don’t get beaten this easily! </em>“Though I suppose what’s behind it has been brooding for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who was angry first?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She was. She said I’d… abandoned her, to talk to Olesa, because I hadn’t met with her for her very important thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very important thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something  about what she was to me,” Momomi said, trying to keep her voice under  control. She couldn’t meet Serané’s eyes, which was infuriating.  “Whatever that means… I can guess, though, I suppose… it’s became I’m  me and so she could never trust me, even if it’s unfair… it’s not like  I can trust myself-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How does Olesa fit into that, exactly?” Serané asked, cutting her off.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  took a breath, collecting herself. “She invited to come tell her… why  she hates me. It’s true, isn’t it? That my father… and her mother…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané closed her eyes, sighing. “It’s true,” she said simply. “That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You knew.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyone  who follows the aristocratic social circles knew,” Serané said. “I was  surprised you didn’t. But Olesa has always been marked by a stigma,  because of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>An accusation for an accusation, is it? </em>“But  we talked about that… I lost track of time… and we talked about her  rivalry with me.” Momomi’s shoulders slumped. “She said it was just  like Kaname with Amane, and I said… I said… a lot of stupid things. It  doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you had an argument. She said things until  you became sufficiently angry that you retaliated, and then she said  worse things, and you did the same and so on. Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could have been there,” Momomi said miserably.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An argument is an argument. Who left first? Her or you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  did. I… I don’t know, it’s like my legs folded. I couldn’t follow, even  if there were so many things to say to her, all of them bad… and I  didn’t know where else to go. So I went nowhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And then you came here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After  a while,” Momomi said. “At first, I was too dazed to move, then I was  so angry and distracted, the moment I thought of her… them both… and I  came here. Now I can’t move again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Serané glanced at the girl. “Thank you, for your trust.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi leaned back and looked at the ceiling. “It’s not trust. I’m just… too tired… to fight any more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re very strong. I have to admire you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?” Momomi whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  like this, you could argue with me so clearly, and you could say  everything you have,” Serané said. “I know it’s just a generalisation  but the fact that you can talk about it at all… I’m impressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go  talk to Kaname if you want strength. She probably hates me so much her  mind’s perfectly clear. Even if not, she’ll be a lot stronger than me.  Kaname wouldn’t cry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you want to do now?” Serané asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to be alone. I want to sleep, if I can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you want to go to a different room tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Momomi said. “I’d like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very well,” Serané said. “I think you both need time alone. But I want you to promise me something, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise me that you won’t let things end like this,” the Etoile said firmly. “One way or the other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t guarantee that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Remember  your resolve. You’re Kiyashiki, the aristocrat who takes her own name,  controls her own fate, and takes everything, aren’t you? You told me  you’d give your all to stay at this school. Don’t tell me you’ll give  less for a friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was a different person then… I felt so… so… angry. I’m just tired now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All the more reason to fight. If you don’t fight now you may lose the next battle, and that might lose the war.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t suit military metaphors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps not, but I still want your promise.” Serané watched her for a moment, then sighed and walked out of the clock tower.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked upwards, following the spiralling course of the staircase  straight upwards to the very top of the tower. It was nostalgic, a  little, because it reminded her of washing those stairs, Olesa slow as  well, Amiki buzzing around her Ojou-sama like a hyperactive bee, and  Kaname… Kaname was being herself, lively and interesting. Somehow it  was her more than anyone else who talked, even though she was the most  asocial of them. Kaname lacked normal social inhibitions, but she still  had a sharp and fast mind and a kind of casual confidence that served  her well. Momomi had been just a little jealous, and so she’d  contrived, along with Olesa who picked up on her game rapidly, to make  Amiki and Kaname race each other to clean the stairs. That left the  other two with relatively less to do. Momomi had found it almost cute  how easily Kaname had fallen into that trap. But she felt bad about it  now. <em>To say nostalgic, about something that happened  yesterday…things are that bad, aren’t they? It seems so long ago, a  whole world ago, a world where Kaname was my kind-of-friend, and not  someone who hated everything about me, all because of me. A shift like  that’s so dramatic it makes me feel like it separates too lives. And I  don’t think it’s possible to go back. </em>She sniffed, smiling at herself. <em>Why am I thinking such silly, melancholy things? It doesn’t matter. I’ve been through worse, right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Come through, please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you.” Shion followed Serané into the clock tower, casting an anxious look at Momomi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The brown-haired girl just glanced at her for a moment then lost interest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tomori-san has been waiting outside all this time,” Serané said. “She was very worried about you both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I wasn’t that worried,” Shion said defensively. “But I didn’t have anything else to do, so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi managed to giggle along with Serané. <em>So she’s dishonest as well… just like… Kaname…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But this is convenient. Tomori-san doesn’t have a roommate. Isn’t that right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Momomi said, surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  yes,” Shion said, sounding embarrassed. “My old one transferred out at  the end of her first year, because her parents were moving. There  hasn’t been anyone since.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So would you be fine sleeping in the spare bed there tonight?” Serané asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t I have a spare room or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could, but I think this is better,” the Etoile said. “Company will leave less time to brood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi considered it. <em>It  all depends on Shion’s manner… if she’s too curious and annoying, like  Serané, it’d be bad. But…I suppose I’m too tired to fight again. </em>“Fine,” she said shortly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you, Tomori-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I would be honoured,” Shion said, bowing briefly. “I will look after her as best I can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané smiled again. “I’m glad. Shall we, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sat up, ignoring the offered hand. “Alright, I’m going, I’m going,” she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  was leaning on the wall at the other side of the door, eyes half-shut  and arms folded. “My, my,” she said quietly. “You’ve put us to a lot of  trouble, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi bit her lip, feeling upset and annoyed in equal measure. <em>That pose, that tone, those words… they’re all Kaname’s. Kariya shouldn’t imitate them.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  don’t cry yourself to sleep too much,” the redhead said when she  received no reply. “If there’s one thing that annoys me, it’s teenage  angst. So get over yourself, the world isn’t over.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry to disappoint,” Momomi said shortly. “I wouldn’t do something that pathetic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Whatever. Give yourself time, girl, you’ll get there.” Kariya turned her head away in pointed indifference.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya, you could be a little more tactful,” Serané chided. “Kiyashiki-chan is very upset.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not upset!” Momomi said, realising the ridiculousness of this statement  about two seconds after she’d made it. “I’m fine now, already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very well, then. I stand corrected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It occurs that Kiyashiki-san can be a little simple at times, bright or not,” Shion smirked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  now, Tomori-san. You know that Kiyashiki-san is very tired right now,  and under some strain. There’s no need to be so forthright.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right, I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You guys don’t know when to quit,” Momomi snorted, irritated. “I thought you were our guardians and mentors.” <em>Actually, Serané’s excuses are more annoying than the actual insults… wait a minute…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we still are, but we need a little fun too,” Shion said. “I’m sure  we’re taking your mind off things, and important things like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s quite right,” Serané said. “A little humour can be very beneficial, psychologically.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like an excuse to mock me, more than anything else.” Momomi folded her arms and walked on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  saw Olesa and Amiki, still working on cleaning the Church. She glared  at them, unsurprised when they both looked uncomfortable. What did  surprise her, and Amiki as well, was Olesa hesitating for a moment then  dropping a mop and walking purposefully towards her. “Phareli-san,” she  intoned blandly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“you,” Momomi replied bluntly, halting. “What do you want?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  appears that my little game has had exponential consequences,” Olesa  said. “I did not anticipate this. It appears you have been accruing  errors all on your own, as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You bitch,” Momomi whispered, close to hitting the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion stepped forwards, indignant. “After all this, how dare you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough,” Serané said softly, stilling the third year. She watched the Spaniard intently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s your problem to solve. Until you have Kenjou back, Phareli-san, <em>we </em>will be the ones with no reason to recognise <em>you </em>as a rival.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly,”  Amiki said, catching up. “You’re way too helpless on your own. So you’d  better drag her back here tomorrow. I still have a score to settle with  her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See to it, Phareli-san,” Olesa said, as if giving a casual order to a servant. She turned and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  bitch,” Momomi muttered, but there was a little less hatred in her  words now. If she listened carefully to herself, it was almost- not  quite- affectionate in tone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who does she think she is, though, talking like that?” Shion said, annoyed. “I hope you punished her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The case is borderline,” Serané said. “But that was not, I think, arrogance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Momomi said. “Something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s  still wrong, Kaname, you’re still missing, and without you I’m not as  strong as I should be. I hate to admit that. I don’t want to have to  say that I need you. No, I don’t need you, but I want you all the same,  because everything’s easier when you’re here, the world’s a more  interesting place, and I know I have someone I can count on until the  end. That’s what I thought, but we ended up this way. I don’t know how  much of that is my fault and how much of it is mine, I still have no  answers to that, and I still can’t face you. I still don’t know whether  it’s best that we try to make it up to each other or whether it’s best  that we never see each other again. I’ve got no way of knowing. But,  like them or hate them, and they’re all so annoying, not like you at  all… they’re here. Without you, it’s not complete, but at least there’s  still a picture. There’s still a place to start. So… so…I’ll settle  things properly. One way or the other. I’ll force myself to do that.  And if my will wavers, I’ll remember this moment, right here, right now.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serané,” she said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” the older girl asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll give you my promise.” Momomi glared at her. “I’ll definitely see it through to the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Those are Kiyashiki-san’s fighting eyes,” the Etoile said. “I’m glad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, tried to stare at her own eyeballs, then looked around for a reflective surface. <em>What the hell are fighting eyes?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I do wonder what she was thinking of, to make her like that,” Serané teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A bunch of complete idiots, but especially the biggest idiot of all,” Momomi said. Her heart still ached, but she could smile.</span></p>
