<h1>Blue-Haired Gray Eyes, Blue-Haired Brown Ones (part 12 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bblade.html">bleeding.blade</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/graybrown-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>It is early spring on Astraea Hill. The graduation ceremony for the 
departing sixth year students had taken place a week ago. 

Tamao is sitting by her favorite tree - her head nestled comfortably on 
Miyuki&#39;s shoulder. At this point, they hardly care about possible 
speculation. In any case, Miyuki&#39;s rumored cancellation of her 
long-standing engagement had only served to increase her belated 
popularity.

Tamao is reading her latest poem to Miyuki. She calls it Miyuki&#39;s 
off-the-job training, Miyuki having easily obtained offers from all 
three publishing companies Shizuma had gotten her interviews for. In a 
week&#39;s time, she would start work as an editor at the literary division 
of one of the three firms. She had accepted this particular company&#39;s 
offer because they were the most accommodating of her university exam 
preparation requirements - and they had also expressed a willingness to 
hire her after university if she maintained her exemplary academic 
record. As for her living arrangements, Shizuma had pointed out that 
since they had been roommates throughout high school anyway, it seemed 
pointless not to continue the arrangement throughout university.

On the family side, things were expectedly not as rosy. Miyuki&#39;s parents 
had threatened - and continued to threaten - to cut her off. It had 
greatly distressed Miyuki at first - far more than the prospect of being 
disowned, she had been dismayed by her parents&#39; accusations of her being 
an ungrateful, undutiful child. As usual, Tamao had seen her through 
that crisis. The only upshot to the entire episode had been the fact 
that her former fianc&eacute; had been so impressed with her determination, 
that he had offered to marry her after university. Miyuki had gently 
made it clear to him at that point that were other reasons (just one 
blue-haired, gray-eyed reason, actually) that she wouldn&#39;t marry him 
ever, university or no university.

After they finish discussing Tamao&#39;s poem, the younger girl pauses a 
moment and retrieves a box from her pocket.  With a hint of her old 
shyness, she extends the box to Miyuki and explains.

&quot;It&#39;s my graduation present to you, Miyuki-sama...I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s late, 
but it took a while for the shop to get me exactly what I wanted.&quot;

Miyuki opens the box...and retrieves a locket on a delicate silver 
chain. Tamao hastens to explain.

&quot;For some reason, I just thought that you&#39;re the sort of person who 
would look really good with a necklace on.&quot;

Miyuki opens the locket and smiles at what she finds inside.

&quot;I love it, Tamao-chan. It&#39;s a beautiful present. Here, you can help me 
put it on.&quot;

Tamao kneels in front of the older woman and fastens the chain around 
her neck. Loving brown eyes look into loving gray ones, then eyes close 
as lips touch in an exquisitely tender kiss.

Inside the locket are twin locks of blue hair.

Chapter End Notes:
That&#39;s it, that&#39;s the end of this story. I would absolutely love to hear 
what you think about it, and would greatly appreciate your reviews and 
feedback. I only viewed the series once, so if there are any 
discrepancies or errors of fact, please don&#39;t hesitate to bring them up. 
Thanks once again for reading this, and I sincerely hope you enjoyed it!</pre>
