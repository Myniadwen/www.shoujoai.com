<pre>Admin Note: Minor corrections by Nutzoide.

Two months had passed since the great upheaval that had been the Astrea 
Hill&#39;s Etoile election, and one young Spica student briefly reflected on 
said period of time with somewhat mixed emotions. Her friend and 
age-mate Chiyo had been equal parts right and wrong when she on the day 
of the election itself had expressed her belief that despite what 
happened that day and regardless of who ended up chosen, the select 
group of friends would continue with their secret night-time 
tea-parties.  

Chiyo was right because despite events the tea parties did indeed 
continue, and they were still held mostly in the dorm room assigned to 
Tamao and Nagisa, with the occasional relocation to the dorm room 
assigned to Tsubomi&#39;s own Spica seniors Hikari and Yaya. Chiyo was also 
wrong because although the meetings continued as before, the younger 
half of the newly minted Etoile couple was never present for them.  

Tsubomi felt torn about her gentle though not entirely thoughtful 
senpai&#39;s absence, on one hand Tsubomi felt relief that Hikari no longer 
tried to find time to spend with her old friends outside of class and 
choir, and on the other it bothered her greatly. The relief was because 
the situation between them, between herself, Hikari, Yaya and Amane, was 
so awkward and strained, and because Tsubomi did not wish for Yaya to 
hurt needlessly. On the other hand Tsubomi watched as Yaya suffered the 
loss of her most beloved one and felt angry that Hikari thought so 
little of the friendship the black-haired girl had given her, that not 
even a moment could be spared for Yaya. It was a confusing situation all 
around. 

In all honesty Tsubomi could not blame Hikari for her absence, nor for 
wanting to spend all her time with the one she loved, Tsubomi knew she 
would want to do the same in Hikari&#39;s place. She also knew that Hikari 
was not a strong person, and so avoiding Yaya and herself was probably 
the only thing she could bear to do while the pain was still so new. 

Tsubomi just wished that the one she loved did not have to suffer so 
much in exchange for Hikari&#39;s newfound happiness. Despondently the 
pink-haired girl kicked at some invisible pebble and bit her lip. Not 
that Yaya would ever know how Tsubomi really felt if Tsubomi could in 
any way help it... no, Tsubomi was well aware that the attractive and 
passionate raven-haired star of the school choir would never see her 
that way. Not Tsubomi, too tall and too grown to manage 
underclassman-cute, and too awkward and forward to even be considered by 
someone who had been taken in by the dainty and feminine Hikari. Tsubomi 
knew she wasn&#39;t pretty enough by far for someone like Yaya to notice, 
she had always known that. 

She had settled for being the favourite sparring-partner, grabbing her 
opportunity to be near the one she secretly yearned for by pretending to 
be yet another girl smitten by Hikari&#39;s charms. Tsubomi and Yaya argued 
and mock-fought over everything and anything, and if Yaya saw Tsubomi as 
some annoying brat that was fun to mess around with that was fine with 
Tsubomi. At least it seemed that since Tsubomi, with her own form of 
tough love, had done her best to drag Yaya out of the depression that 
clung to her, the older girl found teasing and playing with Tsubomi to 
be a good way to keep her thoughts away from painful things. For Yaya 
Tsubomi was more than willing to take the indignity that being her 
senior&#39;s plaything occasionally brought. 

She had tried to get her emotions under an even tighter control, to 
squash anything beyond friendship, for quite some time. Oh had Tsubomi 
ever... but it never really worked. Sometimes all it took was a look at 
Yaya in passing, and Tsubomi&#39;s heart would hurt so badly that Tsubomi 
would stumble, unable to bear it. Yaya would laugh and call her clumsy, 
sometimes going so far as put a hand or an arm on Tsubomi, intensifying 
the pain and the longing all that much more. Tsubomi was terrified that 
she would lose control one day when that happened, and say or do 
something which would make it all too clear to her black-haired friend. 

When that happened Tsubomi felt sure Yaya would do to her what Hikari 
was doing to Yaya now and avoid her entirely. Just thinking that Yaya 
would become no more than a polite nod in passing as she took her place 
in choir practice brought tears to Tsubomi&#39;s eyes. Furiously rubbing at 
her eyes before anyone might see her, Tsubomi felt her tiny kernel of 
anger towards Hikari grow stronger. If Tsubomi hurt this badly just 
thinking that Yaya might no longer spend any time around her, how must 
not Yaya feel now that Hikari spent no time at all with her? Even though 
the two were still officially roommates everyone knew that Yaya did not 
even see Hikari at the dorm, since unofficially the new Etoile couple 
had taken up a joint residence in Amane&#39;s room. 

Crossing her arms and glaring into the air Tsubomi&#39;s thoughts strayed 
back to that subject. Yes, Yaya and Hikari were now roommates on paper 
only, very few of Hikari&#39;s belongings were still there and Yaya for all 
intents and purposes lived alone. The same could be said for Miator&#39;s 
Tamao, although Tsubomi had no idea how they managed it. She had it on 
good authority &#150; namely Chiyo &#150; that while Shizuma had remained in the 
dorms Nagisa had lived with her, and now that the silver-haired former 
Etoile had graduated the school, she had nonetheless managed to acquire 
housing impossibly close to the dorms, allowing Nagisa to sneak away 
from the school during nights and weekends.  

The difference between Nagisa and Hikaru was that although Nagisa was 
also preoccupied with her new lover, she still made some time for her 
friends on occasion. There were still enough of Nagisa&#39;s belongings in 
the room to pass muster should Sister Hamasaka get suspicious and 
inspect it, and at least a few times Nagisa had opted to stay at the 
dorms, as Tsubomi herself had seen since she was present for the tea 
parties on those occasions. 

Tsubomi sighed. No, she really shouldn&#39;t blame Hikari for being true to 
her heart. After all, if Tsubomi had through some divine intervention 
gotten Yaya&#39;s love she too would ignore everything else in order to 
spend every moment she could with her girlfriend, for however long she 
would be allowed to.  

Growling slightly with the frustrations of being young, head over heels 
in love and fully aware that this love would never be anything other 
than unrequited, Tsubomi scowled some more and made faces at her 
surroundings. 

The sudden materialization of a pair of surprisingly strong arms 
wrapping tightly around her and a familiar voice burring intimately into 
her ear made Tsubomi experience something that had her very grateful 
that she was too young to have to worry about having a heart attack. 

&quot;What&#39;s with that face, little flower?&quot; Yaya purred into an ear from so 
small a distance that she was almost brushing her lips across the 
rapidly reddening shell. &quot;Oh I know, you were missing me, weren&#39;t you?&quot; 
The teasing words blew hot air into Tsubomi&#39;s sensitive ear, making the 
younger girl bite back a groan as she tried very hard not to swoon. 

&quot;What, no protests? I always knew you had the hots for me, pet.&quot; Yaya 
continued gleefully, tightening her hold on Tsubomi while the younger 
girl was too flustered to push her away. &quot;Who can blame you though, I 
mean, I am pretty irresistible aren&#39;t I?&quot; 

Pulling away suddenly from the blushing girl Yaya twirled dramatically 
until she could lean against the banister, one hand on her hip and the 
other flicking back her long dark hair while adopting as superior and 
self-satisfied a mien as possible. &quot;Sexy, beautiful, smart... yup, 
simply irresistible. No wonder you can&#39;t bear to be without me.&quot; 

While stunned at first Tsubomi still caught the playful and expectant 
twinkle in dark eyes as Yaya smirked her way at the end of her 
mini-performance and realized that Yaya actually wanted her to react as 
she usually did, by flailing her arms and throwing insults at the older 
girl until utter embarrassment made her peter out into violently 
blushing nothingness. This once, just this once, Tsubomi wasn&#39;t going to 
fall for it. 

&quot;Yeah yeah, you&#39;re irresistible and I just can&#39;t resist all the 
awesomeness that is you.&quot; Tsubomi rolled her eyes at her somewhat 
surprised senior. &quot;Any minute now I&#39;ll be overtaken by an urge to write 
cheesy poetry about you and swoon when you walk by.&quot; Tsubomi turned and 
started making her way down the stairs. &quot;Come on, you don&#39;t want to be 
late for choir practice again, do you?&quot; 

She didn&#39;t make it far before she was stopped, once again by a pair of 
warm arms from behind, only this time they enveloped Tsubomi in an 
actual hug. A soft giggle and then the sultry voice was back tickling 
Tsubomi&#39;s ear. 

&quot;You&#39;re a brat, you know that?&quot; Despite the words the voice was anything 
but displeased. &quot;But you&#39;re my brat.&quot; 

Tsubomi barely had the time to gasp at the words when they were followed 
up by the sensation of warm, full lips pressed near her ear. The contact 
was brief but managed nicely to short-circuit the younger girl&#39;s mind to 
the point she was completely immobile. Yaya on the other hand dashed 
with a delighted giggle down the stairs, leaving Tsubomi frozen in place 
as her mind had temporarily shut down with that kiss. 

Dazed as she was it took Tsubomi a long moment to realize what else had 
occurred during that brief but world-changing moment, and her head 
snapped around to glare over the railing at the dark-haired girl that 
was happily making her way towards the exit. &quot;HEY! That is my umbrella!&quot; 

Yaya turned around to give Tsubomi the brightest grin the younger girl 
had ever seen the other wear since making her acquaintance, and 
Tsubomi&#39;s heart tugged painfully at the sight. &quot;Yeah? Tell you what, if 
you can catch up to me I&#39;ll share it with you, little bird.&quot; Yaya teased 
with a hand on her hip. &quot;I suggest you run if you don&#39;t want to get wet 
today... Tsu-bo- mi!&quot; 

As Tsubomi raced down the stairs to chase after the tall figure prancing 
down the hall she could not keep the smile from her lips. Yaya was 
making sure to go slowly enough that Tsubomi would catch up before she 
reached the doors, and she was smiling all the way. When had Tsubomi 
seen the dark-haired girl really smile like that last? No matter what 
expression she wore Yaya&#39;s eyes always seemed to be crying since 
whatever had really happened between her and Hikari that night, yet now 
those same brown eyes were laughing. 

Warm.  

And looking at Tsubomi. 

Not to mention that Yaya clearly wanted to share an umbrella to the 
church. &#39;So it is love-umbrella, huh?&#39; Tsubomi thought, a blush covering 
her cheeks as she caught up to the taller girl at last. Walking hand in 
hand sharing an umbrella like all the other couples that ventured 
outside on Astrea Hill that day, a romantic kind of stroll that was 
always popular among the girls of the Ichigo-sha. Maybe... maybe... 

Maybe Tsubomi, tall and un-cute Tsubomi, had more of a chance with the 
person she had found herself head-over-heels in love with than she 
thought? Maybe, just maybe, it had been long enough for Yaya to consider 
moving on? 

Maybe this was Tsubomi&#39;s chance at happiness. 

With a bright smile Tsubomi accepted the hand offered her and stepped up 
beside her senior, delighting in the slightly stunned look and brief 
blush that was Yaya&#39;s reaction to it, and then, with a small snap as the 
umbrella opened, the two of them stepped out into the rain. 

Together. </pre>
