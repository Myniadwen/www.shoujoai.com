<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 11 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a>

<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&quot;And the last thing I want to be thinking about right now is French!&quot; 
the fourth year yelled, holding her hands up before her in exasperation.

Realising to what degree she&#39;d raised her voice, the young woman glanced 
back at the Dormitory wall behind her, the one bordering between Shizuma 
and Miyuki&#39;s rooms and lowered her tone as she turned back to her 
girlfriend and pleaded,

&quot;Please Shizuma, all I want right now is to curl up and forget the day. 
I&#39;ve not seen you since breakfast...&quot;

Shizuma sighed and stared into Nagisa&#39;s sad brown eyes, the 
former-Etoile understanding the sentiment all too well but knowing she 
had to get the point across. She was struggling with her own revision as 
it was and knew something would have to give if she were to offer the 
tutorship Nagisa would need ahead of the end of year exams in spring. On 
top of everything else, the last thing either of them needed now was to 
worry about the new Etoile failing a paper.

Nagisa stood in the middle of the room looking exhausted, the week since 
the coronation ceremony having flown by in a blur of ducking Tamao and 
trying to cope with Miyuki. It hadn&#39;t taken Nagisa long to settle into 
the routine as Etoile, drifting between lessons, paperwork and public 
duties, but the vast amount that she&#39;d found crammed into her day was 
taking its toll, and on more than one occasion she&#39;d crawled back to 
Shizuma&#39;s room only to collapse on their bed and fall asleep. At least 
now she finally had the weekend ahead of her, and unlike the previous 
weekend which had been swallowed up by Christmas Ball meetings and the 
council&#39;s frantic attempts to get preparations on track, this time she 
could at least hope for some time to herself with Shizuma.

Nagisa had practically moved into the sixth year&#39;s room in an attempt to 
avoid the uncomfortable experience of being around her own room mate, 
also maximising what little time she shared with her fianc&eacute;e. The matter 
of their rings was fast becoming public knowledge, but the boldness of 
Shizuma&#39;s actions kept discussions about the subject hushed and 
speculative, no one actually having the courage to openly ask questions 
for fear of landing the popular pairing in trouble. Could it be that 
someone had truly tamed the tempestuous former-Etoile enough for the 
flamboyant senior to start making life time commitments, and do so in 
the face of such total adversity? To be singled out and cared for so was 
every underclassman&#39;s dream, and as the new Etoile wandered the halls of 
Astrea, jealous eyes watched her everywhere she went, grasping for a 
glimpse of the infamous platinum band on her finger; the one connecting 
this year&#39;s transfer student to the most idolized woman in Miator.

The silver haired sixth year on the other hand had found herself with 
far too much time on her hands, although none of it having been any use. 
The long minutes alone after meals waiting for her next lesson to start, 
or the hours of solitude in the Green House during the afternoons when 
Nagisa was busy in the council chamber stretched out as she waited for 
the evening and the opportunity to see the pretty red head again. With 
her time at Astrea almost drawing to a close, the upperclassman was 
becoming more and more insular, determined to concentrate on the young 
couple&#39;s future whilst avoiding as much of the school politics as 
possible. The last thing she wanted to do now was make things more 
awkward for Nagisa by contributing to her problems.

The time alone was jarring though, and it felt like a return to her days 
prior to conceding the Etoile, minus the lonely nights spent gazing out 
at the moon. Even if Nagisa was little more than a zombie by the time 
she retired to Shizuma&#39;s room, the warmth and proximity of the young 
woman filled the former-Etoile with happiness and hope for the future. 
Leaving Astrea promised to be nothing like the ordeal it had been 
shaping up to be before speaking to her Mother the previous week.

Shizuma rose from her seat at the study desk, crossing the room before 
taking Nagisa&#39;s hands in her own and holding the younger girl&#39;s gaze, 
her expression stern. She thumbed a wayward red strand from the pretty 
face looking up at her, and kissed the red head gently on the cheek.

&quot;I&#39;d be lying if I said I was eager either my love, but a little before 
bed each night will do your grades the world of good. It won&#39;t take 
long, I promise.&quot;

Nagisa sighed, seeing the sense in Shizuma&#39;s words but fighting it all 
the same. She was far too ratty and irritable to waste the remainder of 
the evening translating that horrible language.

She pulled her hands away, hugging herself as she withdrew,

&quot;Not tonight Shizuma, please...&quot; she said.

The sixth year looked down at her with a sigh,

&quot;Nagisa honey, you need to stay on top of things or come March when all 
of these commitments - &quot;

The red head snapped at the word,

&quot;God please don&#39;t; you sound like Miyuki!&quot; she yelled, and then stopped 
silent, Shizuma looking at her wide-eyed.

With a deep breath the red head caught her rising anger and apologised 
quickly,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Shizuma-sama; I didn&#39;t mean to, I&#39;m just tired.&quot;

She stepped forward and curled her arms around the former-Etoile&#39;s 
waste, resting her head against the taller girl&#39;s shoulder. Shizuma 
looked down at her with sad eyes and comforted the sullen figure, 
kissing the crown of her head. Nagisa was sick of the duty line coming 
from the school council President next door and anything coming close 
put her on edge all too easily. She sighed heavily and whispered to her 
girlfriend,

&quot;Can&#39;t we just go to sleep tonight? I promise I&#39;ll do some tomorrow.&quot;

Disappointed at herself for sparking the outburst, Shizuma&#39;s soft side 
took hold and she smiled at the fourth year wrapped around her with 
loving eyes, running a finger down Nagisa&#39;s cheek before whispering 
back,

&quot;I&#39;ll run us a bath?&quot;

To which Nagisa smiled wearily and nodded in agreement, tugging at the 
clasps on her uniform as she started to undress.

Kissing the red head on the forehead, Shizuma disappeared into the 
bathroom to run the water, sprinkling a few drops of scented oil across 
the surface as it filled.

She wiped a thin film of steam from the wall mirror, checking her face 
and removing her earrings before shaking out her long hair, tipping her 
head to one side to let it hang properly.

Glancing back at the bath quickly, she gathered the silver strands so 
she could put them in a high plat, returning to the bedroom to fetch a 
hair clip. As she passed through the bath room door she turned to ask 
Nagisa for a hand, instead stopping mid-sentence. With a sigh of dismay 
she found herself greeted by the young red head&#39;s slender form curled up 
on the bed in nothing but her underwear, a peaceful look on her face, 
the fourth year fast asleep already.

- - - - -

For the first time in over a week Amane slowly descended the wide 
hallway stairwell to the dining hall corridor. Before she&#39;d even made it 
to the bottom she was already receiving curious looks from the girls 
around her and the fifth year wondered whether it would be easier just 
to turn back now and buy something at recess later.

She&#39;d cut almost all of her classes since Hikari had left, spending as 
much time as possible riding and away from the other students. It made 
life easier being alone, although she knew all too well she was only 
getting away with it because most of the Sensei had spent the week 
wrapping up the term rather than teaching anything new or fundamental. 
If she continued this way come January however, she&#39;d be in the Sister&#39;s 
office in a flash she thought.

Thankfully, as she reached the landing and started towards the dining 
hall and breakfast, she found the unwanted attention ebbing away 
quickly, the girls being drawn instead to the stall next to the dining 
hall doorway; an assorted mass of uniforms queued on one side, with 
three black Miator dresses on the other as Chihaya and Mizushima stood 
selling tickets for the Ball, Tamao next to them with her back to the 
crowd as she placed a wall length poster advertising the event.

Despite the lateness of the eventual announcement, tickets seemed to be 
selling quickly, and it was unlikely that the girls at the end of the 
snaking line would be served before having to take their place for 
breakfast ahead of the morning prayer.

Amane dipped her head as she passed the stall, the Christmas event a 
nasty reminder that she no longer had anyone to attend it with, rubbed 
in by the sparkling blue necklace that caught the light as Tamao turned 
at the most inopportune moment as Amane passed her by.

The two exchanged awkward glances before Amane disappeared into the 
breakfast hall, the venture away from her usual safety at the stables 
and the seclusion of her Dormitory already having reopened deep wounds 
which stung as much now as they had the day Sister Mizue had informed 
her Hikari was leaving.

- - - - -

Kizuna bounced on the spot and clapped her hands in glee.

&quot;Look Remon, they&#39;re selling tickets for the Ball!&quot; she said, pointing 
down the hallway before her as the two girls passed through the fire 
door from the ground floor sleeping quarters.

Grabbing her room mate by the sleeve she pulled the other second year 
through the crowd and towards the back of the long queue that had formed 
in the hall way, groping in her pocket to check she had her purse handy.

Remon peered back over her shoulder across the rim of her glasses as the 
previously accompanying Kagome and Chiyo disappeared amongst the wall of 
uniforms milling about outside the Dormitory food hall. She tugged at 
the anxious Kizuna to slow down and wait, hoping the other two would see 
where they went.

Catching Kagome&#39;s sweet face and pretty locks as she stepped through the 
antiquated fire door, she waved eagerly so the little first year could 
see her.

Kagome waved back and pulled at Chiyo to follow, the tiny Miatorian 
stunned as the doors banged closed behind her and she took in the sight 
ahead.

&quot;All these people...&quot; Chiyo mumbled as she eyeballed the long line 
trailing into the distance, her blue eyes wide. Intimidated, she glanced 
about as Kagome guided her towards the others.

As the two first years reached the others at the back of the queue, 
Kizuna sulked in protest as Remon pulled her back a few places in the 
line so that the four could stand together.

In a small voice which Remon strained to hear in the din of excited 
chatter around them, the Miatorian asked the older girls,

&quot;Is the Ball usually this popular?&quot;

Remon smiled fondly at the dark haired girl&#39;s nervousness and replied in 
an informed tone,

&quot;Last year almost everyone at the Dorms attended! I expect this year 
will be the same; we were just too late down to see everyone else 
waiting.&quot;

Kizuna cut in, bouncing again as she bubbled over in excitement,

&quot;Oh, oh, and you should see how pretty everyone looks dressed up! I 
wonder what styles will be worn this year... I haven&#39;t even picked my 
own outfit yet.&quot;

Remon poked the brown haired girl&#39;s navel and replied with a mock 
disgust,

&quot;You&#39;ll have to wear a tent with that tummy, you were far too eager in 
the Hot Chocolate and Cookies Club.&quot;

Kizuna pouted and prodded her waist line in protest,

&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with my tummy; I only ate more because I&#39;m a good 
girl the rest of the time. At least I don&#39;t fill my stuff face with 
biscuits whenever I&#39;m reading fatso.&quot;

She glared back and Remon adjusted her spectacles in mock distraction.

&quot;Have you picked a dress yet Kagome-chan?&quot; Kizuna asked, changing the 
subject, blanking her room mate. The petite Lulim underclassman twisted 
her mousey curls as she considered the question, her deep green eyes 
swimming in the low light.

&quot;Kagome-chan was hoping to ask Chikaru-senpai what colour she was 
planning to wear before picking her own dress. She would be very happy 
to match Minamoto-sama if she gets the chance to dance with her.&quot;

Remon and Kizuna traded smiles, prompting Chiyo to scowl before making 
her own contribution,

&quot;I won&#39;t be wearing a Ball dress this year; I have to remain in uniform. 
Because I&#39;m room temp for the Etoile, President Rokujo put me in charge 
of supervising the stage for their formal dance at the beginning of the 
night. I don&#39;t suppose I&#39;ll have time for dancing when I&#39;m so busy 
helping my onee-sama and Suzumi-san.&quot;

The two second years rolled their eyes at the boast, although Remon was 
suitably impressed by the responsibility the Miatorian President had 
invested in her, having punished Chiyo only the previous week. Perhaps 
Miyuki had been feeling sorry for the first year when she was handing 
roles out she thought.

Kagome smiled and replied,

&quot;Chiyo-chan will do a very good job I&#39;m sure, she always does her best 
for Etoile-sama.&quot;

Chiyo beamed at the compliment and feeling a little more reassured she 
peered around the tall fifth years in front of them, trying to glimpse 
the front of the queue and the desk that Chihaya and Mizushima were 
serving people from. She gulped and shrank back, returning to her small 
voice, she asked,

&quot;I wonder if we&#39;ll make it to the front before prayer?&quot;

- - - - -

The dining hall was a chaotic mess of uniforms, the usually organized 
seating arrangements having fallen prey to the excitement of the ticket 
stall outside. Girls from different years and schools were thrown 
together as groups of friends gathered to discuss their dresses and chat 
eagerly about the weekend after next.

Having been quickly cornered by one of the concerned catering staff who 
had queried the Spican&#39;s recent absence, Amane sighed in dismay when she 
finally escaped, having discovered that her usual spot by the far window 
was long gone; lost to some marauding Miatorian and Lulim girls who 
perched next to the Spican fifth years they socialised with. Looking 
around for somewhere else to sit, the failed Etoile lowered her eyes to 
avoid the curious stares her presence attracted, searching hurriedly for 
a free space.

Rounding the corner of one of the long hardwood tables, she was 
surprised to find the one remaining table with empty seats was all but 
clear, bar the two white-clad girls huddled together in the very end 
places. Looking up at the individuals who were being seemingly avoided 
by the rest of the Dormitory, Amane&#39;s face dropped as she recognized 
Tsubomi&#39;s pink shock of hair, the first year&#39;s dark haired companion 
immediately obvious by association. Sat opposite her, one arm propping 
her head up, wearing a sullen expression to match her defeated posture 
was Yaya, the third year lost in thought and her partner nervously 
curling her colourful hair around her fingers in concern.

The tall Spican looked around again for an alternative, but as the 
remaining places began to fill from the end of the table opposite the 
isolated pair, Amane realised she may as well take her place before she 
ended up sitting right next to them.

Making sure she&#39;d left some space between herself and the reclusive 
couple, Amane took her seat, nodding politely to the on-looking Tsubomi.

&quot;Good morning Okuwaka-san,&quot; she muttered quietly, prompting Yaya to look 
up, her sad face briefly written with surprise. But as her soft brown 
eyes glanced over the tired looking fifth year, her inward loathing 
caught hold again and she dropped her gaze, mumbling in reply as Amane 
repeated her greeting.

For a moment, the three sat in awkward silence, Yaya&#39;s guilt trip 
freshly renewed and Amane struggling with the unwelcome reminder of her 
girlfriend&#39;s absence. It was only when the Spican upperclassman felt a 
soft grasp on her shoulder that she looked up from the neatly arranged 
crockery and silver cutlery in front of her,

&quot;Amane; I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for you,&quot; came the husky voice, and 
the three turned as Shizuma Hanazono drew back one of the chairs between 
Yaya and Amane.

Her emerald eyes full of concern, the former-Etoile sat gracefully, 
nodding quickly to the other two before turning to the fifth year,

&quot;I&#39;ve not been able to find you anywhere since Coronation day; I&#39;ve been 
worried sick, what happened to you?&quot;

Amane rested a hand on the black sleeve of Shizuma&#39;s forearm and replied 
with a fond expression,

&quot;My apologies Shizuma; I should have come to see you sooner. I needed 
some space though.&quot;

She tipped her head and sighed,

&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to avoid everyone for a bit and get my head together. 
Thank you for your concern though, and thank you again for trying to 
help.&quot;

The Miatorian raised an eyebrow, prompting Amane to fill in the blanks,

&quot;Things didn&#39;t go so well at Hikari&#39;s. I wasn&#39;t coping when I got back.&quot;

Shizuma was about to return comment, when a desperate sounding Yaya cut 
in, the young woman leaning across the empty seat between her and the 
Miatorian to gain their attention,

&quot;You went to Hikari&#39;s? What happened? Did you see her? Is she okay? Is 
she coming back? When - &quot;

Amane shook her head at the barrage of questions and Shizuma held the 
delicate fingers of her right hand up ominously, calling for Yaya to 
stop so that Amane could respond.

The older Spican cupped her hands over her face for a moment, closing 
her eyes before taking a deep breath and turning to face the pensive 
third year.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t get to talk to Hikari; her parents wouldn&#39;t allow 
me to see her. They said she was ill but wouldn&#39;t discuss it any 
further.&quot;

She looked sad, the pain of the experience still fresh,

&quot;They threatened to call the police if I didn&#39;t leave, so I can&#39;t tell 
you anymore than that.&quot;

She dropped her brown gaze as she finished, and Yaya&#39;s shoulders slumped 
as she took in the response.

It was Shizuma&#39;s words that filled the following silence,

&quot;So we still have no idea when she&#39;ll return...&quot; she said, sighing 
herself at the news.

Tsubomi followed the exchange intently, but remained quiet in the 
corner, torn between wanting to reach out a hand for the distraught 
third year opposite and the resentful annoyance that came with the 
mention of Hikari&#39;s name. Drama of one form or another always followed 
it, and she was jealous that even now, despite her absence, Yaya&#39;s room 
mate still had such a strong hold over the dark haired girl&#39;s state of 
mind. Tsubomi was sick of watching Yaya suffer, and along with Hikari&#39;s 
withdrawal from school, she now had the disapproval she&#39;d received since 
the incident with Shion to add to her problems, Yaya having been almost 
completely socially excluded by her peers ever since. Shion&#39;s moods were 
barely tolerable at the best of times, but despite that her popularity 
and the loyalty of her following was unquestionable. Raising a fist to 
the sixth year had certainly not been a wise choice of moves.

It was only the guilt generated by the tiny blonde&#39;s reaction to her and 
Yaya together that day at the Cathedral that kept Tsubomi&#39;s tongue in 
check; the memory of those shrill screams still unnerving the first year 
even now.

&quot;I hope she&#39;s alright,&quot; she muttered quietly, hiding the displeasure 
swimming in her pea-green eyes behind her long pink fringe.

In the background there was a ripple of exaggerated hushing noises, and 
the dining hall started to quieten down, the mass of girls standing 
around or leaning over tables slowly taking their seats as the two 
Miatorian Etoiles appeared at the front of the room to give prayer.

Shizuma straightened up to make sure Nagisa could see her and smiled 
fondly, one hand reaching to play with the platinum band on her finger.

Just as the final few students took their seats, the tall figure of 
Kaname Kenjo slid into the spare seat next to Tsubomi, her dark eyes 
twinkling as she took in her company,

&quot;Well now, isn&#39;t this cosy,&quot; she remarked, and flashed a smirk before 
the girls dipped their heads as Tamao begun the Prayer.

Moments passed as the dark haired Etoile recited the verse, the catering 
staff shuffling around quietly to catch up on serving, having delayed 
bringing breakfast out to allow the council assistants to process the 
queue outside.

As soon as Tamao retook her seat, Shizuma looked up in curiosity,

&quot;You&#39;re missing something Kenjo-san?&quot; she asked with a frown, adding for 
clarity, &quot;around 150, 155? Brunette, pouts a lot lately?&quot;

Kaname&#39;s lips formed her crooked smile and she replied in a flat tone,

&quot;Hmm, it seems I am yes.&quot; She shrugged, grimacing slightly before 
adding, &quot;Yeah, I know what you mean about the pout. It&#39;s becoming 
something of an annoyance that.&quot;

She snorted, tipped her head and then continued matter-of-factly in her 
usual sultry tones,

&quot;I guess we&#39;re not doing so well these days. I left her in our dormitory 
sulking. You know; jealous angst and all that,&quot; after which she added 
with an evil grin, &quot;but then, I couldn&#39;t be in better company for 
discussing that topic could I...&quot;

Tsubomi caught a flash of something on Yaya&#39;s face and Amane looked away 
in avoidance.

Kaname&#39;s sly smiled remained,

&quot;Although apparently I stand to be corrected; after all, here sits the 
woman claiming to have tamed the beast,&quot; with which Kaname looked 
meaningfully at Shizuma&#39;s left hand, the Miatorian still toying with her 
recently obtained piece of jewellery.

Confused by the comment, Amane turned back to the conversation,

&quot;What do you mean by that Kenjo-san?&quot; she asked, and she looked at 
Shizuma enquiringly having caught the direction of her fellow Spican&#39;s 
gaze.

Kaname&#39;s dark eyes slanted in bemusement,

&quot;What? Did your time as a cave dwelling recluse go to your head? I told 
you the other day Amane.&quot;

None the wiser, the equestrian super-student shook her head slowly, and 
even Yaya looked up in interest.

Shizuma sat silent, not forthcoming in such crowded surroundings, which 
provided Kaname with a huge opportunity for amusement as she responded 
on the former-Etoile&#39;s behalf, not realizing the topic was so low key 
outside of school council circles. She waited a moment for the two women 
from catering staff to place the remaining dishes on the table, then 
when she was sure they were out of ear shot, she continued with 
vindictive glee,

&quot;It seems Hanazono-san&#39;s affection for the red-headed half of our new 
Etoile was understated even at your coronation Amane; that would be 
Nagisa&#39;s engagement ring she&#39;s wearing.&quot;

Amane&#39;s jaw went uncharacteristically slack as recollection hit her and 
she remembered Kaname&#39;s off hand comment from the previous week. In her 
tiredness and disorientation she&#39;d dismissed it as fresh produce from 
the Dormitory rumour mill, the tall Spican being her typically sarcastic 
self. But given Shizuma&#39;s stoic silence now, the words took a whole new 
meaning. Yaya&#39;s dark eyes lit up and Tsubomi sat forward, peering at the 
silver haired sixth year&#39;s cupped hands.

Shizuma, expression set, continued to look directly at Kaname, her 
emerald eyes cold and failing to betray her reaction to having been put 
on the spot.

Kaname grinned back, and smirked sideways at Amane,

&quot;Obviously the rest of us are doing something wrong,&quot; she grinned, then 
adding with surprisingly honest sentiment,

&quot;Although I can&#39;t say there&#39;s anyone that deserves the happiness more. 
Good luck to you both,&quot; she said, nodding toward Shizuma before leaning 
forward to begin loading her plate with food.

Amane tried and failed to catch the former-Etoile&#39;s gaze, before 
gingerly lifting Shizuma&#39;s right hand away so she could see the ring on 
the Miatorian&#39;s left.

&quot;Shizuma?&quot; she asked in surprise, shocked by her friend&#39;s bravado. &quot;This 
is really true? You&#39;ve actually been wearing that in school?&quot;

It was only then that Shizuma turned to respond,

&quot;You know what she means to me Amane. I can&#39;t risk losing someone else 
so dear to me.&quot;

Catching the undercurrent in the upperclassman&#39;s words, Amane smiled, 
feeling both sympathy and a true warmth in her heart for the first time 
in what seemed like an age.

Shizuma continued,

&quot;I was going to tell you on the day, but you were so upset when you came 
to my room I figured it was the last thing you needed to hear.&quot;

Amane reached a hand out for Shizuma&#39;s and smiled, unexpected tears 
forming at the corner of her eyes,

&quot;No, not at all, I could have done with the good news.&quot;

She pondered for a minute, adding wistfully, &quot;I&#39;m so happy for you both, 
even if I am a little confused. How are you intending to pull this off 
exactly?&quot;

Noting Amane&#39;s glazed eyes, Kaname tipped her fork in her fellow 
Spican&#39;s direction and muttered between mouthfuls,

&quot;Careful Amane; if you start bawling I might actually mistake you for 
being the girlie type.&quot;

The words were laced with irony given their exchange the day Kaname had 
found the failed Etoile asleep in the stable boiler room, and Amane 
managed an awkward smile in reply.

Bemused by the exchange, Shizuma&#39;s emerald eyes twinkled,

&quot;You know you&#39;re almost becoming tolerable of late Kenjo-san.&quot;

Munching happily, the tennis champion retorted,

&quot;Personal revelation, there&#39;s better.&quot;

She stopped midway through cutting a peace of bacon in two, then after a 
moment&#39;s consideration she added ominously,

&quot;And nothing worse...&quot;

When the comment was greeted by insightful silence, she glanced around 
briefly. Having decided she&#39;d shared far too much of herself for her own 
comfort, she then layered her usual sarcasm over the top to keep face,

&quot;It seems you&#39;re the only one sat here not touched by young Konohana-san 
in one way or another Shizuma. You know, it&#39;s amazing how someone so 
one-dimensional has managed to fuck up so many people at once.&quot;

The words provoked the expected response from almost everyone sat at the 
table listening, although the characteristically uncaring expression on 
Kaname&#39;s face had a transparent edge to it today. Perhaps she was 
mellowing in her old age she thought in bemusement, before opting to let 
the thought slide, returning her attention to her food instead.

The girls sat quietly for a while as they followed suit, loading their 
own plates and beginning to eat. Yaya went back to her own internal 
distractions, and Amane&#39;s attention switched between the much needed 
meal and the platinum band on Shizuma&#39;s finger, the ring catching the 
light from time to time as the Miatorian ate.

Then as the Kaname&#39;s sharp eyes caught the familiar figure of Momomi 
Kiyashiki as she appeared in the dining hall door way, the brunette&#39;s 
body language hostile and annoyed, Kaname sighed and tossed her knife 
and fork into the centre of her half emptied plate. She rose to her 
feet, looking down at Shizuma with an odd expression,

&quot;If you ever figure out whatever it is that you two have that the rest 
of us don&#39;t, feel free to cut me in eh, it&#39;ll save me all manner of 
trouble in the future.&quot;

She smirked, nodding in the direction of Shizuma&#39;s engagement ring.

&quot;And good luck with that; I&#39;m sure Miyuki will gain great amusement from 
butt fucking the pair of you every step of the way.&quot;

She turned to Amane, grinning mischievously,

&quot;Good to see you up and about finally Ohtori-san. Come find me next time 
you fancy a game of tennis and we&#39;ll have to see if I was right in the 
boiler house,&quot; adding as she glanced towards the door, &quot;might give the 
miserable cow something to finally smile about.&quot;

Her lip curled again, after which she disappeared off towards the door, 
Momomi having spotted her as she stood, the brunette flouncing off into 
the corridor beyond with a scowl.

Watching as Kaname began her pursuit in vain, the two former-Etoile 
exchanged bemused glances before continuing with their meal.

- - - - -

The cold air hit Amane&#39;s face as she left the Dormitory building, 
stepping out onto the stone- flagged pathway and down towards the Astrea 
Hill lake and the school grounds themselves. Despite hanging high and 
proud in the clear blue sky, the warm winter sun took several moments to 
catch up and relieve the unpleasant sensation from her lips and cheeks. 
The snows of the previous weeks hadn&#39;t reappeared, although the icy 
winds and freezing nights persisted. Unwelcome when travelling between 
lessons perhaps, but a boon for riding practice the fifth year thought, 
and she looked out across the skeletal shrubbery and frigid trees 
towards the paddocks at Spica. Catching the churned earth of the 
practice ring through the naked branches, she smiled half-heartedly. 
Despite lacking any real enthusiasm, riding had been a saving 
distraction, and Star Bride a valued companion. There is no judgement 
from the animal kingdom.

No blame. No disapproval.

As she wandered thoughtfully to class, her hands clasping her brown 
leather satchel before her, the young woman considered the revelation at 
breakfast.

Between the haze of sleeping rough and the previous night&#39;s ordeal, 
Amane hadn&#39;t taken Kaname&#39;s comment seriously that morning in the boiler 
room. To see proof now that Shizuma was not only cementing her 
convictions for her relationship with Nagisa so formally, but also doing 
so in the scrutiny of the public eye thoroughly stunned the Spican.

Such a bold move; so resolute and defiant. Surely the Sister and staff 
must know by now? God knows how the parents of the two girls would 
react, bringing such shame so openly to their family names.

And then there was the matter of the school itself. Amane didn&#39;t know of 
a single occurrence at any of the top end schools where two same-sex 
students had declared a relationship formally; if the two Miatorians saw 
this through they&#39;d definitely be setting a ground breaking precedent.

So very bold.

So typically Shizuma.

She must adore Nagisa, Amane thought to herself. Absolutely worship her; 
to be so sure, so utterly certain to take those risks.

The fifth year stopped, tipping her head back slightly to take in the 
wide Japanese sky above her.

Lost in vertigo, her head swam and she wondered; had she ever felt that 
way about Hikari?

But as the thought faded, she caught something else following it.

Past tense.

She paused.

There it was. Finally.

She sighed again and dropped her gaze to the ground, her dark bob 
falling forward to frame her face. Her eyes vacantly followed the 
pattern on the paving slabs of the pathway beneath her as she rolled the 
words over and over in her head.

Had she?

What would she have given if challenged to remain beside the young 
blonde underclassman?

For moments the sullen figure considered the yawning autumn months; the 
long mornings in the paddock, Hikari stood at the tree line watching the 
older girl practice with Star Bride. The furtive glances across the 
dining hall, those big blue eyes staring up at her when they finally had 
their time alone together; the warmth of the tiny girl&#39;s embrace, her 
racing heart beat, the smell of her loosely curled hair...

And that pretty smile; so adoring, so heart-warming, yet...

Shame cut the images short.

Flicking her head back, she stood stoic for a second, jaw set.

Adoration. Youthful, confused adoration.

And Amane had taken that and twisted it into something else. Despite 
Shizuma&#39;s dismissive words, the truth still cut true.

Hikari was little more than a child.

A hollow feeling inside, she took comfort in what the fifth year told 
herself was realism; would she have sacrificed her education and 
scholarship to remain beside Hikari? Could she have spat on her parent&#39;s 
values and risked their wrath? Would she brave the eyes of society and 
brush aside their judgemental gaze as gracefully as the Miatorian idol 
did so well; her aloof air and confident presence dismissing remarks 
before they could even be made...

No. Of course not. Amane had neither the self-confidence nor the courage 
to step so far from the beaten path.

Which meant that realistically, at least in the long run, there would 
only have been a single, predictable outcome for Hikari and herself. The 
same outcome there always is for people in their situation at school and 
University.

Eventual, regretful, and painful separation.

A return to the same mundane normality that every Japanese adult faces 
day to day as they graduate and join the real world.

Marriage, responsibility, and social expectation.

Sighing and hastening her pace the Spican student took consolation in 
the train of thought. She was no Shizuma, and Hikari was no Nagisa. The 
Spican couple&#39;s love, if you could even call it that, had never faced 
the same challenges that the Miatorian&#39;s had already survived.

It was just a childish fancy that had turned into something almost 
perverse in nature that never should have been, and would never have had 
a future anyway.

Why take those risks if it were only to end in disappointment and 
regret?

At least in her place far away from the school, Amane could do her 
former-Etoilian partner no more harm; lead her astray no further.

And as her skin warmed, a combination of her brisk pace and the 
brilliant disc shining above her, Amane tried to strengthen her resolve, 
caught somewhere between a returning sense of order after the long days 
of feeling lost, and a gut wrenching sense of loss that shadowed it.

- - - - -

As the dining hall cleared out, Nagisa watched in sliding dismay as 
Shizuma pointed to her wrist watch before gesturing apologetically and 
disappearing from her perch just outside the doorway. She waved solemnly 
across the wide dining room as she did, and Nagisa felt her heart sink 
as the silver flash of hair disappeared down the corridor. Shizuma had 
been waiting for the young Etoile to finish up so they could walk to 
lessons together, but as usual, Miyuki had found reason to delay her. 
Between the day&#39;s classes and the mountain of waiting paperwork, Nagisa 
knew that yet again it would probably be recess, if not dinner later 
that evening when the couple would next have a chance to be together.

Stood at the head table alongside Tamao, Chihaya and Mizushima, Miyuki 
was discussing a discrepancy in the takings for the Ball tickets, the 
two fourth year&#39;s watching pensively as the school council President 
drummed neatly manicured fingernails across the wooden surface she was 
leant over.

&quot;And you both recounted for them?&quot; Miyuki asked the Etoile, holding a 
wedge of bank notes in one hand and running the index finger of her 
other across the ledger lying on the table before her, meticulously 
checking the totals neatly scrawled across the page.

When Nagisa failed to reply, Tamao glanced up to see her room mate 
staring across the hall and offered,

&quot;Nagisa recounted Rokujo-san; I watched her do it.&quot; The fourth year&#39;s 
voice was quiet, the dark haired Etoile sensing another lecture 
forthcoming.

Miyuki turned back from the table and sighed.

&quot;I asked you both to double check did I not?&quot;

Tamao nodded, and when Nagisa failed to respond, Miyuki repeated 
herself,

&quot;Did I not?&quot;

With an inward sigh, Nagisa turned from the open door way to face the 
sixth grader with down turned eyes.

&quot;Yes you did Rokujo-san,&quot; she replied flatly, and Chihaya and Mizushima 
exchanged glances, sensing Nagisa&#39;s mood.

Those closest to the Miatorian council and the council members 
themselves were becoming increasingly accustomed to seeing Miyuki lose 
her temper with the young red head, the council President apparently 
struggling to focus the new Etoile. Her attitude towards Tamao remained 
pleasant and courteous as she would typically behave with everyone else, 
but her interactions with Nagisa were becoming increasingly 
uncomfortable to observe, prompting Hitomi and Mizuho in particular to 
question Miyuki&#39;s motives. But no matter how awful Miyuki might be 
acting toward her, there was no denying Nagisa&#39;s lack of conviction for 
the role, and for now that stayed everyone&#39;s tongues. It would be hard 
to stand up for Shizuma&#39;s girlfriend when she seemed so disinterested in 
helping herself, the upperclassman making mistake after mistake in her 
half-baked attempts to keep up. So with no one speaking out and no one 
to rein Miyuki in, the relationship between Miator&#39;s President and the 
red headed Etoile was at best ice cold, at worst openly dictatorial and 
hostile.

Noting the response, Miyuki begun the morning&#39;s sermon,

&quot;There are two Etoile for a reason Nagisa. What do you think that reason 
might be?&quot;

The atmosphere already prickly, Miyuki&#39;s expression was set, her tone 
patronizing, and when Nagisa failed to raise her gaze or answer the 
question, Miyuki scowled at the young woman before her,

&quot;Support Nagisa; it&#39;s that simple. The Etoile are there to help one 
another, to support one another, to guide one another&#39;s judgement, and 
most importantly in this case; to check each other&#39;s work.&quot;

The sixth year waved the wedge of notes and snapped,

&quot;It&#39;s spot on; there&#39;s nothing missing at all. This means both the count 
and your recount were out and given your mind is obviously elsewhere as 
usual, it&#39;s no wonder you didn&#39;t pick up on their mistake when you were 
recounting for them. You&#39;ve left these poor girls standing around 
petrified because of your distraction, which is exactly why I wanted 
Tamao to double check you.&quot;

Nagisa felt a spark of anger flicker inside; Miyuki had spent ten 
minutes carefully going through the figures after recounting the money 
herself the second she&#39;d joined them when Tamao had reported the 
variance. Despite taking so long to vocalise the conclusion, she must 
have known that the money was fine almost immediately. The book work was 
just for show and to act as a delay.

Nagisa was vexed, and the pretty Etoile bit her lip to avoid snapping, 
knowing all too well that Miyuki had only wasted those extra minutes to 
make sure Shizuma had gone so the fourth year couldn&#39;t accompany her to 
class.

She wanted to rage, to let fly at the pompous cow before her, but knew 
the aftermath would only make her life harder in the long run. Since the 
emotional landslide at the coronation ceremony, she hadn&#39;t the stomach 
for open confrontation with the older student, and instead Nagisa simply 
nodded politely, offering,

&quot;My apologies Rokujo-san; I was simply trying to save time.&quot;

The words stung as Nagisa pushed herself to deliver them; the constant 
barrage she was forcing herself to take from Miyuki nagging at her in 
the form of self-loathing and defeatism. She found herself wondering who 
the amazing young woman Shizuma kept referring to was, since she was 
increasingly certain it couldn&#39;t be her.

Miyuki rolled her eyes disapprovingly and replied,

&quot;You&#39;d find this much easier if you just did as I told you Nagisa. I&#39;ve 
been partner and support to Astrea&#39;s Etoile for longer than you&#39;ve even 
attended the school, let alone my time on the council prior to that; I 
would have thought you knew when to acknowledge someone more informed 
than yourself.&quot;

Nagisa grimaced inwardly, noting the subtext and having wondered how 
long it would take the sixth former to slide some form of reference to 
her history with Shizuma into the lecture. She sighed and nodded in 
submission, wishing she could just slap the girl and walk off.

One more week she told herself.

Satisfied that she&#39;d have freshly renewed her dominancy over Nagisa, 
Miyuki nodded to the waiting fourth years, Chihaya and Mizushima setting 
about tiding up the paperwork and equipment they&#39;d used for the stall. 
At the same time, Miyuki rolled up the takings before putting them into 
a cloth currency bag, intent on giving it to the Sister for storing in 
the office safe.

&quot;Thank you for your help this morning Noriko-san, Takemura-san. My 
apologies if we made you both feel uncomfortable whilst checking the 
takings; I&#39;m sure you understand it was of no reflection to yourselves. 
You worked hard under awkward conditions this morning, mistakes were 
more than possible and school finances require us to be thorough.&quot;

She tipped a head to Tamao, adding before she left,

&quot;It&#39;s not just herself she&#39;s letting down like this Suzumi-san. As well 
as the students, she&#39;s placing more burden on you than you deserve from 
this partnership. Remember that next time she&#39;s off daydreaming.&quot;

Accepting Tamao&#39;s polite nod of acknowledgement, Miyuki strode off 
towards the doorway, her black dress rustling softly as she walked.

Chihaya had a sorry look in her eyes, recognizing the guilt trip from 
the school council President, although Mizushima had been glancing 
regularly at the wall clock knowing she was becoming increasingly late 
for an Archery team meeting. Snapping at Nagisa in her low tones the 
purple haired girl asked,

&quot;Can&#39;t you let go for two minutes Nagisa? Are you really that insecure 
about Shizuma&#39;s feelings for you?&quot;

Noting the disapproving scowl that crossed her room mate&#39;s face 
following the outburst, Mizushima hid hers behind her dark purple bob 
and gathered the last of her things.

&quot;I just think you could make this a lot easier on yourself,&quot; she said 
more reasonably, then followed after Miyuki, Chihaya shrugging 
sympathetically in consolation as she trailed behind.

Tamao had remained silent as she watched the exchange, stood next to the 
edge of the table, now rolling the sapphire gem hanging around her neck 
between her fingers for comfort. She sighed softly.

&quot;I dislike the way she talks to you Nagisa-chan. It&#39;s not fair that 
she&#39;s so mean to you.&quot;

The pretty fourth year reached a hand out and gingerly stroked the red 
head&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re letting anyone down; I know how hard this is for 
you.&quot;

Her blue eyes passing over Nagisa, she smiled hopefully, gentle fingers 
reaching out to offer her usual support.

The red head snapped back protectively,

&quot;I&#39;m just fine Suzumi-san,&quot; she muttered, before picking up her satchel 
from its place leaning against the table leg. Shouldering it and 
straightening her uniform out, she stepped away from Tamao&#39;s touch.

&quot;We&#39;re late ourselves now, we should go.&quot;

Tamao sighed at the increased physical perimeter Nagisa had taken to 
maintaining around herself, and nodded her response.

&quot;Yes we are. Did you manage the French homework okay?&quot; she asked, 
attempting to defuse the situation.

Nagisa&#39;s faced blanched as the unfinished summary flashed back into her 
mind, but as the pair headed to the door, heels clipping on the polished 
wooden floorboards, she took the lead to hide her exasperated expression 
from her room mate. She kicked herself for forgetting it, having meant 
to finish the work the previous evening before going to bed. She&#39;d had 
fallen asleep instead; the task being the source of her conversation 
with Shizuma about revision. Not interested in opening the door for 
Tamao to spark up prying conversation she simply murmured a 
non-committal response.

Changing the subject, Tamao continued,

&quot;You know; that dress I got in town isn&#39;t nearly formal enough for the 
Ball now that we&#39;ve become Etoile. You and I should go shopping again 
soon to make sure we match.&quot;

Her blue eyes sparkled,

&quot;Perhaps you&#39;ll let me help you choose something pretty?&quot; she said, 
doing her best to avoid the mental images of Nagisa trying on various 
outfits for her.

The red head continued in silence, offering Tamao first use of the door.

&quot;Uh huh...&quot; she mumbled, coolly watching as the dark haired girl crossed 
her path.

Taking the hint, Tamao fell into silence as the pair continued up the 
corridor towards the main exit, the fourth year content to bide her 
time, hoping for another chance to draw the pretty upperclassman out of 
her shell later.

- - - - -

Yaya leant heavily on the dormitory door as she pushed it to, using the 
soft grained wood as a prop as if it could hold her heavy heart up.

She stood for a moment, the hard surface cool on her skin in the warmth 
of the Dorms, closing her eyes, thankful for the silence within.

After the noise of the breakfast hall, the constant chatter and viscous 
eyes that betrayed accusing thoughts brewing behind them, the constant 
presence of Tsubomi at her side and its nagging effect on her 
conscience, the dark haired Spican felt she could finally think.

Not peace, not solace; something else.

Clarity perhaps?

She chewed her lip in agitation. In retrospect, having been largely 
confined to her room by Sister Mizue seemed almost like an act of mercy.

She pushed away from the door and crossed the empty room to the window 
sill where her laptop lay, opening the shell and thumbing the machine 
into life. As the mechanism chattered away, she wandered back towards 
her newly appropriated desk mirror, looking at the sullen face staring 
back, long black hair framing it.

A pathetic pout of sorts hung her across her lower lip, and she snorted 
in contempt.

&quot;Yaya Nanto, you look fucking awful,&quot; she muttered, as if the glassy 
image were about to reply in protest.

She gathered the heavy black strands of hair in one hand, twisting them 
round into a high top knot where she held them briefly, the skin on the 
back of her neck able to breath, cherishing the kiss of cool air and the 
relief it brought.

Hearing the laptop chime in readiness, she let her hand go, the black 
blur settling into the same dark shroud that she now used to hide her 
face from the peering eyes of society.

Wallowing in self-pity and an unavoidable emptiness beneath it, she 
flicked through her digital music collection, looking for one artist in 
particular.

She&#39;d hated this, Yaya thought to herself with a wry smirk.

The mix of classic and fringe had been unbearably unacceptable to her 
purist blonde dormie, and the two girls had regularly bickered over 
whether or not it was &#39;proper&#39; music.

Manipulating the player through slanted coal eye lashes, Yaya thumped 
the touch pad to start the track, pushing the dial on the speaker well 
past polite and considerate.

As the haunting intro floated through the room, Yaya closed her eyes, 
waiting for the guitars and pitch perfect operatics to kick in, pounding 
the floor boards and assaulting the windows as they did.

Stood still in a tornado of soprano, dirty riffs, strings and bass, she 
let the heavy slab sealing the tomb in her chest loose, releasing the 
gut wrenching torrent she&#39;d been denying all morning.

The wall of emotion washed over her as tears sprang to her eyes, a sneer 
twisting her soft lips, turning into a snarl as she clenched her fists 
and with a single, gasping breath, screamed as loudly as her burning 
lungs would allow her.

- - - - -

&quot;Miyuki-sama and Shizuma-sama look very pretty all dressed up,&quot; Chikaru 
offered in a tiny voice, perched on the edge of Miyuki&#39;s bed. She 
cradled the fluffy tiger in her lap, stroking her hands across it as she 
watched the two third years prepare for their evening.

The Miatorian room mates were busy adjusting their hair and make up, 
Shizuma putting her long silver mane into its top knot while Miyuki was 
fumbling with her eye liner in the dimly lit dormitory. The room was 
cold and dark, the single bulb hanging from the ceiling not providing 
anywhere near enough illumination to work by.

The French school they were visiting was almost medieval in both feel 
and facility.

&quot;I wish I could go to the Ball too,&quot; Chikaru continued in a small voice, 
sounding disappointed. &quot;I like dressing up. My Mom used to help me make 
all kinds of costumes before I left for Astrea Hill.&quot;

Shizuma smiled fondly at the dreamy second year, noting with a wry 
after-thought the relationship, or more correctly, the lack of 
relationship that she shared with her own mother. The tiny Lulim girl 
had grown on Shizuma during her brief stay with the two third years, and 
the Miatorian underclassman would be sad to see less of her on their 
return to Japan.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d look radiant Chikaru-chan,&quot; she said, adding with a 
playful grin, &quot;just like dear Miyuki. Doesn&#39;t she look amazing Chikaru? 
She&#39;ll be the talk of the Ball!&quot;

Miyuki felt her cheeks grow warm and pretended to miss the comment as 
she concentrated on getting the balance between too little and too much 
right in the appalling light; she already felt uncomfortable in the 
daringly provocative dress as it was; the last thing she needed now was 
to misjudge her make up and cross the fine line bordering sensual and 
down right cheap.

The Hanazono girl grinned at the feigned ignorance and tipped her head 
to better regard her room mate&#39;s figure. She considered the dark haired 
girl and the satin blue material she was wrapped in through low 
eye-lashes, the shimmering dress clinging to Miyuki&#39;s skin.

&quot;I&#39;ll be the envy of Astrea with you on my arm tonight Rokujo-san,&quot; she 
stated with false formality.

The school council assistant paused, her eye liner hovering next to her 
cheek, the hand mirror she grasped in the other hand held high to 
conceal her face. She closed her eyes briefly, attempting to regain her 
composure. Shizuma&#39;s attentions were distractingly direct, and Miyuki 
had spent the evening of preparation overwhelmed by her response to 
them, the warm glow of vodka from the half-bottle Shizuma had smuggled 
into the school with her for the leaving party compounding matters.

Miyuki considered in flustered recollection how she&#39;d seen the pleasant 
unrest coursing through her now mirrored by so many of Shizuma&#39;s younger 
pursuits back in the Dorms. Presumably fuelled by the forthcoming social 
performance Shizuma had planned having seen Miyuki&#39;s potential attire 
for the Ball earlier in the week, the emerald-eyed tease had spent the 
days since seeing the dress all over Miyuki; lewd comments, suggestive 
grins and wild excitement abound. The usually refrained and resolute 
Miyuki had never been so completely on the receiving end of the Hanazono 
experience before, and found herself swept along with the tide, left 
permanently self-conscious with fuzzy cotton-wool for a brain.

So this is how it feels to be wooed by the tempestuous Miatorian is it? 
She shook her head gently as she reopened her dark eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m sure everyone will be too busy looking at you as per usual Shizuma. 
I doubt there&#39;s a single girl from our year here that you&#39;ve not chased 
around the Dormitory at one point or another.&quot;

Miyuki pondered whether she&#39;d caught bitter sentiment in that last 
statement, and continued more carefully, trying to avoid sounding 
resentful, knowing it would only make Shizuma worse.

&quot;I doubt anything could distract them from their race for your continued 
attentions.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s lip curled as she watched Miyuki squirm,

&quot;And imagine how crushed they&#39;ll be when they see you tonight my dear,&quot; 
she shot back with glee, grinning like a cheshire cat who&#39;s paw rested 
firmly on it&#39;s dinner&#39;s tail. Standing, she finished up with her hair, 
finally satisfied it was firmly in place.


She tipped her head back slightly to let it settle, and then moved to 
perch on the edge of the bed the two Miatorians had been sharing. 
Slipping her heels on, she glanced up as she tightened the delicate 
leather straps, catching Chikaru staring at her from her place curled up 
on the opposite bed.

The little second year had been watching the exchange intently.

&quot;Chikaru-chan?&quot; she asked, puzzled by the piercing brown gaze.

Chikaru, peering back from behind her long dark hair and cute red bows 
replied softly,

&quot;You look so happy Shizuma-sama,&quot; she explained.

Miyuki turned from her mirror, confused by the unexpected statement. 
Chikaru continued, &quot;You too Rokujo-sama. You both look really happy.&quot;

And as the tiny Lulim girl stroked the two-tone fur of the fluffy tiger 
lying on the bed next to her, she added,

&quot;I wish I had someone I was such good friends with.&quot;

- - - - -

The shrill ring of the school bell released Nagisa from Math, and with 
an air of purpose she strode from the Moon group classroom, racing down 
the hallway towards the exit.

She had a good fifteen minutes before French; more than enough to grasp 
a few moments with Shizuma in the seclusion of the Green House.

Nodding curtly to her fellow Miatorians as they greeted the red-headed 
Etoile in the corridor, the slender fourth year gripped her satchel 
awkwardly in one hand while she checked her hair and adjusted her 
uniform on the way, catching her reflection in one of the painted 
partition windows as she passed.

She grinned, the thought of Shizuma&#39;s touch bringing a smile to her 
lips, switching the satchel back to both hands, rolling her engagement 
ring on her finger, reassured by the caress of the smooth metallic 
surface.

&quot;Etoile-sama?&quot;

For a second she missed the soft call, and it was only the second 
attempt that sprung Nagisa from her little world,

&quot;Uh, Etoile-sama? I have a message for you!&quot;

The fourth year stopped in her tracks, sighing heavily before she turned 
to greet the expectant face behind, her chest rising and falling from 
the exertion of trying to escape the building so quickly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, you needed me?&quot; she replied politely.

The first year dipped her gaze politely and beamed at being addressed by 
one of such importance.

Nagisa grimaced at the convention.

&quot;Is there something you needed?&quot; she asserted.

The youngster was in no hurry to end the experience. Righting herself 
she took a moment to regain her composure, holding a polite pose and 
tripping over her words as she replied,

&quot;Uh, Etoile-sa, Etoile-sama. President Rokujo asked me to find you after 
class.&quot;

The upperclassman snorted inwardly. Typical, she thought to herself.

&quot;She requests you accompany her in the main hall,&quot; then with excitement 
the first tiny brunette added in a hushed voice, &quot;I think they&#39;re 
beginning to decorate for the Ball today.&quot;

Nagisa bit her lip to avoid snapping, nodding respectfully before 
dismissing the girl.

&quot;Thank you for your time, you should go to your next class now,&quot; she 
said, trying not to sound too blunt.

Heart sinking, and knowing that once again she would have to wait until 
the evening to see her silver-haired fianc&eacute;e, the new Etoile wheeled and 
headed toward Miator&#39;s banquet hall.

- - - - -

The Miator main hall was a grand affair, constructed almost a century 
before along with the majority of the original building. The great 
vaulted ceiling and intricate chandeliers had withstood the test of 
time, retaining all of their beauty and grace from an era long gone, 
proudly maintained by the Sisters and the staff over the years. The 
detailed wooden-panelled walls were draped with antiquated tapestries 
featuring school insignia and class emblems, mirroring the same gothic 
style that defined the uniform and official seal, bordered by numerous 
paintings of establishment founders and contributors. The vast tiled 
floor featured complex patterns and designs, a huge green Miatorian 
herald adjoining the stage area, situated directly below and in front of 
the wide balcony over-hang, under which were rows of wooden pews, 
separated into ranks by intricately carved pillars that held the balcony 
aloft.

Dotted across the room were various figures from the Miator student 
council, the new Etoile as well as various assistants and additions from 
the Christmas Ball team that Miyuki had put together, each going about 
different tasks and preparations, ranging from adjusting the lighting 
rig and speakers to arranging the stage and the beginnings of the floral 
display across the back where the celebratory banners would hang. The 
construction of which involved several long rolls of soft yellow fabric 
which lay sprawled across the floor while a consternated looking 
Mizushima debated heatedly with her room mate as to how to go about 
cutting them to size.

Into this mess stepped a wide-eyed Kagome and the bemused Chikaru, the 
two Lulim girls having come to liaise with Miyuki as she organized the 
group into action.

&quot;Kagome-chan has never seen the Miator hall before; it&#39;s very impressive 
Chikaru-senpai,&quot; she said in a small voice, her pupils huge in the dim 
light as she looked around, her tiny features dwarfed by the grand 
chamber.

Chikaru smiled, and tipped her head as she replied to the first year in 
hushed tones,

&quot;Going back many years, when Miator was a still convent, the nuns used 
to eat here every night. The stage was once an altar, and if you look 
carefully, you can see where it&#39;s been built up to protect the original 
stone work,&quot; the fifth year explained, smiling at the engrossed brunette 
as she followed Chikaru&#39;s out stretched hand, her slender finger 
pointing at the panelled woodwork.

Kagome looked up at the Lulim council president in awe.

&quot;Chikaru-sama knows something about everything!&quot; she offered politely.

The older girl chuckled softly in reply and shook her head, which 
prompted Kagome to nod enthusiastically. Rather than get into a debate 
on the issue, Chikaru looked up, greeting a busy looking Miyuki who 
stood amongst a flock of black uniformed girls she&#39;d been addressing,

&quot;Good afternoon Rokujo-san. I have those figures for you.&quot;

Then with a pleasant smile she placed a fond hand on Kagome&#39;s shoulder,

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind me bringing my new assistant; I know how 
secretive you&#39;ve been of this year&#39;s Ball.&quot;

Miyuki nodded respectfully and waved a hand in dismissal.

&quot;Of course not Chikaru,&quot; she replied, &quot;after the work she did on the 
election programs she&#39;s more than welcome.&quot;

She then stepped away from the others, leading the Lulim girls to one 
side to talk privately.

&quot;So how do we stand Minamoto-san?&quot; she asked.

Chikaru drew a well used notepad from her uniform pocket and flicked to 
the appropriate page.

&quot;Just over five hundred thousand yen as of this morning, so well on our 
way for matching last year,&quot; the fifth year answered.

Miyuki nodded approvingly, but before she could reply she was cut short, 
the chamber echoing a howling Chihaya as she berated her room mate, the 
pair stood either side of a long stretch of yellow cloth.

&quot;Are you dumb woman? Did your mother drop you too many times?&quot; she 
screamed, nursing a finger and battering Mizushima across the back with 
her other hand.

Her purple haired companion scowled back, scissors in one hand, a long 
length of banner fabric in the other.

&quot;Well if you&#39;d just hold it straight I could see where I was cutting!&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s jaw set and her nostrils flared in annoyance as her chest rose 
to draw breath. But just as she stepped forward, intending to dress the 
two down, Kagome&#39;s tiny voice chimed up from beside her.

&quot;Kagome-chan is wondering why you don&#39;t both use the trellis tables in 
the corner over there. It would be much easier if you drew the cloth 
across and cut it with a rotary cutter.&quot;

Miyuki stopped in her tracks and looked with a cocktail of agitation and 
amusement as Kagome set about organizing the two fourth years as though 
she were talking to a pair of simpleton kindergarten students.

&quot;That way, you could both be preparing banners at the same time and 
you&#39;d get them all made in half the time. Kagome-chan thinks that if you 
ask Etoile-sama Tamao-chan nicely she might lend you her cutter; I saw 
she had one when we were making cards for the Etoile election, and I 
know Chikaru-sama has one in her embroidery kit too.&quot;

Then in clarification she added in a faltering voice,

&quot;Kagome-chan meant the first Election Ceremony, not the second,&quot; before 
curtseying politely to Nagisa and Tamao in flustered respect, 
&quot;Kagome-chan apologizes Etoile-sama.&quot;

She then stood for a moment, a slack-jawed Mizushima and Chihaya frozen 
mid-argument, staring back at the tiny brunette next to them.

All heads having turned, the Hall fell into stunned silence. It was the 
musical sound of Chikaru&#39;s laughter that eventually broke it.

Miyuki, quickly recovering from her own smirk to save face, snapped her 
fingers in response,

&quot;Well you two! What do you think you&#39;re playing at? Do as Byakudan-san 
says, she&#39;s obviously more capable of organizing the task than the pair 
of you upperclassmen!&quot;

Chikaru, eyes betraying her smile despite her renewed self-control, 
beckoned her first year assistant back to her side. Grinning again, she 
leant forward to cup the young girl&#39;s face adoringly.

&quot;A very sensible suggestion Kagome-chan,&quot; she said quietly, her long 
black hair falling forward.

Jolted into action by Miyuki, the two Miatorian fourth year&#39;s hurried 
off in different directions, Chihaya setting about erecting the tables 
while Mizushima, still clutching her finger, deftly caught the Dormitory 
keys that Tamao had thrown to her from atop the foot ladder she was 
using to hang posters with Nagisa, the purple haired girl then heading 
toward the double doors beyond.

Calling after her Miyuki added sarcastically,

&quot;And make sure you go to the infirmary so the nurse can inspect that 
finger, presuming you can remember where it is!&quot;

Mizushima answered with a snort which she hoped the school council 
President hadn&#39;t heard from so far away. The heavy doors swung widely as 
she stormed through them.

Jaw still set, Miyuki passed her gaze across the rest of the room to 
make sure everyone else had returned to work, before turning to little 
Kagome who huddled next to Chikaru defensively, having realised she&#39;d 
spoken out too boldly.

Miyuki let her expression relax and smiled at the first year.

&quot;You&#39;re becoming quite an asset aren&#39;t you little one.&quot;

And then betraying a soft side that very few were privileged to witness, 
she knelt before the obviously intimidated underclassman, straightening 
the young girl&#39;s tunic tie with a motherly flourish.

With an idle tone she shared an observation quietly with the brunette,

&quot;You remind me of a young lady I had the pleasure of travelling with not 
so many years ago; she was just as practical and quick thinking when 
we&#39;d pried her out of her shell too.&quot;

Dark eyes sparkling, the school council President smoothed the checked 
fabric of the Lulim girl&#39;s uniform and smiled up at her peer, Chikaru 
catching the comment and nodding in appreciation.

Looking back at Kagome, the senior continued,

&quot;Through her hard work and dedication, it wasn&#39;t long before she 
attained great standing at her school. I think if you continue the way 
you are currently Byakudan-san, you&#39;ll follow her footsteps in just the 
same manner.&quot;

Wondering what had gone between the two older girls, the first year&#39;s 
gaze switched between the two faces with a puzzled expression, and then 
remembering her place, Kagome replied politely,

&quot;Thank you Rokujo-sama, that is very kind of you.&quot;

Reaching down and squeezing Kagome&#39;s hand, Chikaru whispered that it was 
time to go.

&quot;I hope the evening is a productive one Rokujo-san,&quot; she said, bidding 
her fellow Presidential colleague a good evening before setting off for 
the exit, a wide smile still spread across her pretty face.

- - - - -

It had been one of other Deux class girls that had nudged Tsubomi in the 
corridor, worried that the music pounding all afternoon from Yaya&#39;s 
dormitory would only land the third year in more trouble with the 
Sister.

Concern gripping her, the young Spican had hurried off to check on Yaya, 
her pink hair exploding messily in her haste as she took the steps in 
the Dormitory entrance-way two at a time.

The week since the fight with Shion hadn&#39;t become any less awkward as 
time passed, and not only did Tsubomi find herself in the god awful 
position she was in with Yaya, but she also found herself trying to deal 
with the disapproving scowls from her fellow students for associating 
with the school trouble maker.

After all, why would anyone want to talk to someone prepared to strike 
the school council President? Was Tomori-san actually capable of doing 
anything that might deserve such rash action?

If only they knew how involved the first year and Yaya actually were, 
Tsubomi sighed to herself. Then they could shove their judgemental looks 
up each other&#39;s arses.

Flicking her fringe from her eyes as she reached the door, the 
underclassman was taken back by the sheer volume of the music coming 
from the third year&#39;s Dorm; a weird mix of opera and rock that only 
Yaya&#39;s warped sense of taste would find palatable.

Such a fuck up Tsubomi thought to herself, and having made a mental note 
to reintroduce the girl to some respectable R&amp;B, the Spican knocked on 
the door in vain.

There was no way Yaya would be able to hear her over the music she 
thought, and reached for the door handle instead.

Hopefully it would be open, though knowing her luck...

The door clicked softly, and drawing it back, Tsubomi berated herself 
for being such a pessimist, and peered into the rumbling noise beyond.

The room was dark, the curtains drawn, hiding the late afternoon dusk, a 
desk lamp shining in the corner over one of the twin beds where the 
huddled form of the raven haired third year lay.

Tip toeing across the room, Tsubomi fumbled briefly until she&#39;d dropped 
the volume dial considerably to appease the other residents, hoping it 
wasn&#39;t too late to avoid another trip to the Sister&#39;s office.

Turning back to gaze across the room, the first year looked with dismay 
at the young girl lying prone opposite her. Journal sprawled underneath 
her lithe form, Yaya had obviously fallen asleep doing her class work.

The younger Spican crept forward, her white trainers forgiving the odd 
misstep as she dodged the mess of clothes and valuables strewn across 
the floor, making her way to the bed side. She looked down fondly, 
considering Yaya&#39;s long black hair, its shining strands hiding her face.

So pretty, Tsubomi thought to herself. She&#39;d always been jealous of the 
older girl&#39;s hair; it was so much thicker and well behaved than the 
first year&#39;s pink locks.

So much for the all-new, ultra-caring hair dye she was using she 
thought.

Leaning forward, she peered in curiosity to see what Yaya had been 
doing, reaching a hand out gingerly to draw aside the charcoal flow of 
hair that partially covered the page.

Her heart jumped as she brushed Yaya&#39;s hair back behind her ear, 
revealing thick streaks of mascara that betrayed long dried tears, the 
trail running the length of the third year&#39;s cheeks and onto the page 
beneath her.

Breath completely still, a horrible feeling rising in her chest, Tsubomi 
felt her heart slide as she tipped her head, following the black lines 
onto the paper lying underneath the young woman she cared for so deeply.

Scrawled across the page in heavy bold letters were the words,

&quot;I miss you so much,&quot; the pen that drew them still clutched 
subconsciously in Yaya&#39;s slender hand.

- - - - -

&quot;Shizuma?&quot; came the smooth tones of Miator&#39;s school council President.

In the silence of the Green House, the evening air still besides the 
soft whistle of the wind in the glass doorway, Miyuki might well have 
shouted the words aloud, Shizuma&#39;s emerald eyes widening in surprise as 
she knelt behind an obscuring line of plants.

What on earth was she doing here? the former-Etoile asked herself, her 
gaze lost on the brickwork before her.

Recovering her composure, Shizuma stood gracefully, smoothing her apron 
out as she rose to her feet, her silver hair tumbling into place across 
her shoulders.

&quot;Rokujo-san? What brings you here?&quot; she asked, her tone low and level, 
not betraying her confusion.

She was tired after a long day of revision and the yawning solitude that 
came with tending the Green House alone; the last thing she needed now 
was a shouting match. But the school council President must have a 
motive for visiting, she thought. That or something had happened to 
Nagisa, a possibility which only unnerved the former-Etoile further.

&quot;I would have thought that despite everything of late Shizuma, after so 
many years together the formality was unnecessary?&quot; Miyuki replied, 
looking up with a similarly neutral expression at her former room mate 
from the pathway beneath the high table area where Shizuma had been 
working.

The silver haired sixth year shifted her gaze slightly, then repeated 
her question, uncomfortable but giving as much as the statement asserted 
her former-room mate deserved,

&quot;Is there something I can do for you Miyuki?&quot; she asked.

The school council President climbed the steps to the table platform, 
her black sleeved arms crossed behind the back of her soft Miator 
uniform. Brushing her dark bob back behind one ear, she looked at the 
earth-covered trawl and the plant pot Shizuma had been using it to 
prepare, the items resting on the floor where she&#39;d left them.

Deep brown gaze snapping into focus on the young woman&#39;s face, Miyuki 
replied,

&quot;I thought I might come by to check on the flowers; we&#39;ll be needing 
them shortly for the bouquets and arrangements,&quot; she explained.

And after a pause, she continued,

&quot;I&#39;m also aware that you&#39;ve been alone in here often this past week. 
Although it was by design, I didn&#39;t want you to feel completely isolated 
again.&quot;

Dipping her eyes she added to finish,

&quot;Not so soon after coming out of your shell.&quot;

Shizuma stood stoic, her face chiselled from marble; cold and static.

What in god&#39;s name was she up to?

The emerald-eyed Miatorian breathed deeply before gathering her reply 
carefully, caught off guard by the council President&#39;s appearance and 
the passive tone that she&#39;d presented herself with.

&quot;That would seem, uncharacteristically friendly Miyuki,&quot; she said, and 
then noting a pang in her stomach, she added out of guilt, &quot;at least of 
late.&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s eyes twinkled in the low light, and she moved to sit at the 
table, her hands resting on the cold metal-work.

&quot;That would be a fair comment,&quot; she said calmly, surprising Shizuma 
further by avoiding the obvious trigger laid before her. A trigger that 
the previous week&#39;s Miyuki would have merrily seized as an opportunity 
for insults and the beginnings of a blazing row.

Shizuma was perplexed, but unwilling to reveal herself as such and 
appear vulnerable, the former-Etoile joined Miyuki at the table, 
removing her gardening gloves carefully before placing them tidily on 
the patterned surface in front of her.

The council President continued.

&quot;I should apologise for my tone at the Ceremony Shizuma, it was uncalled 
for.&quot;

She smiled weakly, the expression appearing perfectly genuine to 
Shizuma&#39;s scouring gaze, the emerald-eyed senior regarding her fellow 
Miatorian with guarded disbelief and doubt.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have trivialised something that obviously means so much to 
you, regardless of the wisdom that may have led to it.&quot;

Miyuki was quick to continue before Shizuma could object and read the 
comment as inflammatory,

&quot;You&#39;re very committed to your choices, I respect that.&quot;

Unsure where the game was leading, the former-Etoile sat silent.

Miyuki bowed her head, and knowing not to play into Shizuma&#39;s hands as 
she had so many times before over the years, remained quiet, avoiding 
being trapped into talking to fill the pause for fear of giving herself 
away.

For a moment, the girls sat in thought, mentally positioning in the 
awkward situation before them.

Shizuma, realising Miyuki wasn&#39;t in a hurry to reply, moved to don her 
gloves and return to work, but as she half-stood, Miyuki added,

&quot;It wasn&#39;t just your experience that led me to place you here Shizuma, 
I&#39;m sure you know that.&quot;

Here it is Shizuma thought; the angle.

Sitting again, Shizuma tipped her head, feeling the soft brown suede of 
the gloves against her skin as she straightened them out. Wondering what 
Miyuki was preparing, she found herself uncomfortable when her 
former-room mate&#39;s words struck an all too appropriate chord.

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to think it was out of spite Shizuma. I can see what 
you both mean to each other,&quot;

Then after a pause she added,

&quot;That much is very obvious.&quot;

Her brown gaze holding Shizuma&#39;s emerald stare confidently, she 
delivered the telling words,

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m trying to stand in the way of that; I&#39;m 
just trying to do what&#39;s right for Nagisa&#39;s education, and in turn, for 
Miator.&quot;

Shizuma knew she should quickly reply in protest; dismiss the notion as 
a false front and cut Miyuki down before she had a chance to wedge the 
door open, but inwardly, she already knew where Miyuki was going with 
this, and in the grim light of day, Miyuki was unquestionably right.

&quot;You know her grades are weak Shizuma,&quot; the school council President 
pushed,

&quot;She&#39;s only just transferred as it is, and now with the Etoile to 
contend with and the extra pressure you&#39;ve both added with your recent 
choices, she&#39;d surely stumble with this year&#39;s exams if she was free to 
distract herself with you constantly,&quot;

Miyuki gestured with her hands, amplifying her point,

&quot;I&#39;ve only wanted to do what&#39;s right for her, and more importantly, in 
turn, for Miator,&quot;

She tipped her head slightly for effect, her next words hushed as though 
they were some deep admission,

&quot;They&#39;d be Astrea&#39;s strongest pairing if Nagisa would only focus. When 
she&#39;s on form, she&#39;s amazingly empathetic and understanding; a perfect 
contrast to Tamao&#39;s sensibility and practicality. A true Etoile 
partnership after all these years...&quot;

And with a sly smirk she layered,

&quot;Makes a joke of Spica&#39;s last offering don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Shizuma, silenced by her own inner-admissions, could only respond with a 
cautious nod. The sincerity was hard to fault, and the sixth year&#39;s tone 
was almost conciliatory.

Perhaps Miyuki was actually capable of an apology, as close as this 
conceited attempt could be to one.

What&#39;s more, Shizuma was rarely present at Miyuki&#39;s berating sermons, 
never there to see the seething anger and dripping sarcasm that the 
school council President allegedly levelled at the red headed Etoile. 
All she saw was the tired, defeated young woman that flopped into her 
arms each night.

For all Shizuma knew, that might simply be the result of the young, 
free-spirited woman she loved so dearly learning to cope with the same 
awful entrapment that Shizuma herself had found the Etoile title carried 
along with it.

Regardless; even if Miyuki was trying to play her, Shizuma had to 
concede Miyuki&#39;s point. Nagisa would definitely fail this year&#39;s exams 
without someone&#39;s help; that much was certain.

The silver haired Miatorian sighed, and tipped her own gaze, gathering 
her response.

&quot;I&#39;ve never wanted the hostility Miyuki. We were good friends once.&quot;

Anymore, and Shizuma felt she&#39;d have given too much of herself.

She was too tired for the mind games. All she wanted now was a 
conclusion and some time with Nagisa before bed.

The sparkle in Miyuki&#39;s eyes was hard to read, her own reply just as 
measured,

&quot;We&#39;ve both been rash lately Shizuma. I&#39;d like to think that friendship 
isn&#39;t so distant that it can&#39;t be fixed though.&quot;

Then with an air of personal admission, she added,

&quot;I misjudged my own feelings.&quot;

Shizuma sat in silence, unwilling to respond.

This time Miyuki did fill the gap,

&quot;I just didn&#39;t want you to think it was all about us. I don&#39;t want her 
to fail Shizuma; be it for you or be it for Miator. We&#39;ve both worked so 
hard at that post in the past, it would be a shame to waste that all 
that pain and effort now. That&#39;s all.&quot;

Pursing her lips in a conceding manner, the council President offered a 
weak shrug.

&quot;Perhaps we might consider this a fresh start?&quot; she offered, the words 
hanging in the air.

The silver haired upperclassman failed to respond, distain written 
across the back of Shizuma&#39;s mind. Miyuki knew not to press the point, 
sensing she&#39;d scored as much of a victory as she could from the 
excursion.

After a moment Shizuma bowed her head slightly, still defensive, and 
looked back at the pot she&#39;d been tending, signalling an end to the 
conversation.

Miyuki, still impervious to Shizuma&#39;s scrutinizing eyes, accepted the 
declaration and stood, nodding politely.

&quot;Thank you for your hard work Hanazono-san; the flowers will look 
amazing this year,&quot; she said in a formal tone, bowing before leaving as 
the position of former-Etoile commanded.

&quot;Sleep well Shizuma,&quot; she called as she left, the glass door sliding 
closed behind her.

Perplexed and confused by the uncertain subtext of the encounter, 
Shizuma was left wondering exactly what is was that Miyuki was playing 
at.

- - - - -

&quot;Etoile-sama?&quot; Chiyo chirped, snapping Nagisa from her train of thought 
and causing the red head to jump in surprise.

In the dim light of the street lamp at the junction by the Green House, 
Nagisa had to strain to see the tiny form of her room temp behind her.

&quot;Chiyo-chan?&quot; she asked distractedly, looking again in the direction of 
the soft light spilling from the glass house at the end of the pathway.

&quot;There&#39;s a phone call for you in the office onee-sama,&quot; Chiyo replied, 
twisting her hands in her lap before her, shuffling to ward away the 
cold wind. With a soft admiration in her eyes she continued, &quot;Your 
French tutor rang to arrange your next lesson Etoile-sama.&quot;

Nagisa, mind still racing as she questioned Miyuki&#39;s presence in the 
Green House with her fianc&eacute;e, the seemingly comfortable conversation the 
two girls were having at the high table having unsettled her, dismissed 
the statement briefly before snapping back to question it.

&quot;Chiyo-chan?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Your French tutor Etoile-sama?&quot;

And lost in bewildered confusion, Nagisa muttered in reply to no one in 
particular,

&quot;But I don&#39;t have a French tutor?&quot;
