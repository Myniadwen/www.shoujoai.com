“Ah,  I’m exhausted,” Momomi said, collapsing onto the long grass. Olesa  followed without a word, wrapping her hands round her knees.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You rich kids,” Kaname muttered. “No stamina at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m staying right here,” Amiki said. “Unless you want me to carry on, Olesa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no need. You can rest for now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good.” Amiki lay back and looking up at the sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I brought some food, you know,” Shion said, taking out a picnic basket. “So help yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve got food?” Momomi said, pushing herself to a sitting position. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why else did you think we stuck around this long?” Kariya asked sarcastically. She was standing over them, folding her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya…  no, I give up.” Serané sat elegently, kneeling and inviting Kariya to  sit beside her. “We did stick around for the food. It’s not genteel to  admit that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is good,” Momomi said, biting into a sandwich. “Did you make all this yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me?  I thought you knew me, Kiyashiki-san.” Shion chuckled. “I had some  darling students in your year make all this for me. They’re so kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Momomi frowned. “You know, I feel an almost moral obligation to protect our year from people like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’d be the first time you felt a moral <em>anything</em>,” Amiki said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drink, too.” Shion pulled out several flasks. “Anyone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is it water?” Olesa asked depressively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think I want to see water ever again,” Amiki finished, sighing and stretching.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fruit juice,” Shion said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wonderful,” Momomi said. “Please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Though they said they made it themselves,” Shion murmured doubtfully. “I’ve no idea what fruit it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As long as it’s not wine,” Serané said in a conciliatory tone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, aren’t we condescending?” Kariya sighed. “Having a picnic with delinquents being punished, I’m ashamed of myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sure we’re only intending to provide them with moral guidance and  support, Kariya. Punishment must be accompanied by assistance, don’t  you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nah,” Kariya said. “Cut their first little finger  off and the problem will sort itself out.” She caught Serané’s gaze. “I  was joking, okay? Just a joke.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not funny when you say it,  because it totally sounds like you mean it,” Momomi quipped, eating  rapidly. She was ravenously hungry. This was the most physical strain  she’d been put through in a long time, and it was annoying her. She was  definitely unfit, she’d always known that, but it sure was annoying her  when for the first time in months it really caught up to her. It had  even got to Kaname on some level.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya moved slightly, turning  to face them. “In any case, I can’t say I like any of you. You’re all  antisocial, difficult, violent, manipulative and deceitful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki smirked. “So we’re just like you. Learn from the best, Etoile-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I can accept that in that it’s part of who you are,” Kariya said. “It’s  probably beyond me to change that, if none of you are willing to change  yourselves.” She leaned back, looking up the sky. “That’s the way you  are. It’s not something I’m unfamiliar with. But… I don’t get why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there anything to get?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  is, always,” Kariya replied. “Satisfy my curiosity. Off the record,  here and now. I don’t care how stupid or awful your reasoning is. I’ll  think more of you for admitting to it than coming up with a pretty  half-truth. And I will see through a lie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wanted to hurt them,” Kaname said warningly. “Nothing more. Understand that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was just following my loyalties,” Amiki said. “But none of this has anything to do with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  for me…” Momomi closed her eyes and decided to play along. It would  work to her advantage, after who came next. “Serving my interests.  That’s to say my desire to stay at this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san constructed a very intricate theory, in my case. Perhaps you should ask her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t want her theories. I want your answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  are many reasons,” Olesa said. “One is the opposite of Kiyashiki-san’s.  I don’t want her to stay at this school. Another reason is that I don’t  trust her even like this. One of the others is a matter that was  between the Phareli and the Peres.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I understand,” Serané said, nodding briefly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” Momomi blinked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You do?” Kariya said, equally surprised.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  deference to Peres-san’s wishes, I won’t elaborate here, save to say  that I understand.” Serané looked unusually serious. “It is a delicate  matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, fine,” Kariya said, sounding a little  off-balance. “If it’s good enough for Serané, that’s good enough for  me. None of that excuses rampant violence, though. It’s completely  undignified behaviour. I expect all of you to live up to the names of  your families. And, no, Kenjou, that doesn’t make you an exception. You  are here, whether I like it or not. I look to you for exceptional  standards, not poor ones. Otherwise nothing will change, that’s the  nature of a pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The only thing I’m pioneering is the  ability of the school to legitimately drop the existence of scholarship  students in the prospectus. To ease upper class guilt. That’s it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Opportunities  come in many forms, some of them patronising. But you make of them what  you will. So far, Kenjou, you’ve disappointed me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gave her a very dark look, but she was cut off before she could reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can we broach another subject, Etoile-sama?” Shion asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go ahead,” Kariya said. “I’m tired of this conversation anyway, and I’m sure they are too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not something for me to talk about, though. This is from Momomi. She’s mentioned it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is now really the time?” Momomi demanded, glaring at Shion. <em>Annoying. Did she think I’d forgotten? I was going to broach it another way…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Out with it,” Kariya said. “I hate it when people beat around the bush.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  blushed at the Etoile’s piercing gaze. Scorn her from a distance as  much as you like, but in proximity it was impossible to deny Kariya’s…  presence. It was like and yet unlike the sense that Kaname radiated,  which was more consistently hostile but also more familiar. Somehow,  because Kaname was hostile all the time, it became comforting. Kariya’s  detached scrutiny was a lot less pleasant. “Well, that’s to say… it’s  about me staying at this school. I have mentioned it to you before. I  want to stay here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even for someone of your behaviour, that  isn’t a problem in theory,” Serané murmured. “So the catch is what?”  She sounded like she already knew.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s to say that my father is against me staying here. For now. I think I can persuade him, but…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  no other choice,” Kariya snapped. “You need parental consent to be  here. That’s not a rule a thirteen year-old can violate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know  that,” Momomi said impatiently. “I know that already. Like I said, I’m  trying to persuade him, and doing everything I can, even though I hate  him. But… it just doesn’t seem fair that after a year, when I’m finally  starting to like this dump somehow, I’m going to be torn away again.  It’s the first time in my life I’ve ever had a sense of place, and that  may be stupid, but I want to try and hold onto that. At least, I’m not  going to lose it without a fight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Kariya said quietly.  She looked at the sky for a moment. “Well, I should bloody well think  so, too. You definitely have to fight for the important things in this  world, and I’m glad you’ve realised that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The problem is deciding what’s most important,” Serané said. “Especially when two important things collide.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I only really care about my sister, and I can manage without. So it’s not exactly a moral dilemma.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m surprised, though,” Serané remarked. “You really only know Kenjou-kun from this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s not exactly true,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, it is,” Amiki said. “It definitely is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, what do you intend?” Kariya asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  managed to get them to postpone judgement for a few weeks. That’s  something. The way I figure it, if I can pass the scholarship exams at  the end of the year I can say that I’m paying for myself, so to speak.  If my father’s not paying money, he should lose interest. Provided I  take the right attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The scholarship exams are difficult,  you know,” Serané said. “The competition is intense, and you’re not  exactly what we intended when we suggested the concept to the  Superiors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I know that too,” Momomi said. “But I don’t  think I have any other choice, and I don’t want to be dependant on a  man I hate forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s all very admirable,” Kariya said  sarcastically. “But it’s not meant for family feuds, like Shizuru says.  We’d be setting a dangerous precedent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the contrary, I think  this case is perfect for it,” Shion suggested. “To allow someone who  would not otherwise go to the school to go and benefit, based on their  academic excellence. That’s the meaning of a scholarship, is it not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  is,” Kariya said. “But like we said before, it’s really meant to  broaden the pathetic social diversity of this school by a moderate  amount. Kiyashiki-chan won’t help with that at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If she’s  passed over because of her background, that’s just another type of  discrimination,” Shion argued. “The case is the same, she needs that  money to stay here as she wants to. Her family situation doesn’t have  anything to do with it if they aren’t willing to support her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  would you have us do, then? Throw open the system so that a dozen  families suddenly decide they won’t permit their students to study  here, except through scholarship payment?” Kariya snorted. “It would be  ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The exams are extremely hard,” Shion said. “I sat  them out of curiosity last year after the fact, and I struggled badly.  If Momomi requires the money and can get the results needed, that  should be enough. This isn’t something where her parents matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well…  perhaps,” Kariya sighed. “I like your logic, at least, but it’s only  wordplay. We’re the ones who have to deal with the fallout and the  responsibility. What do you think, Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané closed her  eyes for a moment, thinking. “If it was made clear by her father that  there was no other alternative… that would be acceptable, I think. Even  if it isn’t what we intended, she wants to be here even if she has to  work hard for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good enough for me, too, I guess” Kariya said. “Call me sentimental. Don’t get used to this!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  sighed. “Though that may not be enough. If it ever comes up, we’ll put  your case to the Superior and see what happens. That’s all we can do.  The trouble is that adults tend to intrude on the dreams of children,  that’s what they see as their right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please, do your best for me,” Momomi asked, bowing. “A chance is all I want.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  remember you have to pass the actual exams, too,” Shion said playfully.  “They’re devised by the Etoiles themselves in their more sadistic  moments, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I happen to have a good friend who came out  of them with unsurpassed high standards,” Momomi said boldly. “So I’m  not afraid on that front.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What else?” Kariya asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d  like to invite my parents here. If I can convince my father to come.  I’m counting on you all to impress him, though he’d never admit it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We could help you with inviting him,” Serané said. “Perhaps. But that depends on us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How so?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  depends on how deeply we want to get involved,” Kariya explained. “I’m  uneasy becoming your advocate. And…” she glanced at Serané.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not entirely comfortable with this,” Serané said, sighing again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s that,” Kariya said, sounding as if she expected Momomi to go back to her room and pack her bags on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  not exactly,” Serané said hurriedly, twisting her hands in her lap.  “This shouldn’t be about my comfort zones. What does Kariya think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think… well, I don’t think too much either way,” Kariya replied. “It’s not like I care too much either way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s nice,” Serané teased, smiling again. “Now what does Kariya really think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  got me,” Kariya admitted. “Well, the way I see it, this’ll be something  new. As she’s Kenjou-kun’s friend, Peres-chan’s enemy, and one of the  students at the school we attend, I think we should back her to the  hilt. Even thought I hate the lying little bitch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Be careful with the word friend,” Kaname warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, semantics aside… that’s what we are, isn’t it?” Serané mused. “Students for the students, the Etoiles. Helping them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  punishing them,” Kariya added. “Because we’re responsible. But that,  too. I haven’t fixed you yet, Kiyashiki, I’m inclined to do this so I  can make you a somewhat respectable member of society.” She closed her  eyes. “Of course, you’ll owe us an arm, a leg, a spleen and all your  kidneys. Believe me in that! I’ll expect full payment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I’m  surprised again,” Shion said, smiling. “When you look at her,  Kiyashiki-san isn’t exactly the most popular of girls. But she has all  these advocates. Aren’t you lucky, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Momomi said. “Though I don’t think anyone here’s doing this out of friendship.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a weird thing about you, all the same,” Kariya said. “I’ve no idea how  you’ve swayed me, but you have somehow. You have an inexplicable  quality, Kiyashiki. Be careful with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s called beauty, grace and charisma,” Momomi said cockily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can  I just say for the record that we aren’t helping her because we like  her,” Amiki said. “Peres-san has decided we should, though. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think it’s that Kiyahsiki-san is everyone’s rebel, here,” Serané  offered meditatively. “To defy our destiny, it’s something we all want  to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“However it happened, she’s scraped into this somehow,” Shion said. “With six people to help her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a little,” Serané said hastily. “I shouldn’t go too far. Indeed I don’t intend to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just a little,” Olesa warned. “I don’t regard her as a friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked around them all, feeling a little… fuzzy despite herself. That  wasn’t like her at all. But then she looked and saw Kaname, lying down  and facing away. She looked moody. Momomi had no idea why but she found  it a pleasant sight. She lay back, taking hold of Kaname’s arm and  holding it gently while she looked up at the sky. “Why so gloomy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell are you doing?” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  knows?” Momomi said, slightly unsure herself. “Well, I’m feeling good  today.” The clouds were very beautiful. She could hear Kaname’s shallow  breathing, too, so close. It felt good to do something casual like  this, once in a while, and screw Amiki. It was nice to feel like maybe  you had a friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m glad you’re getting on well,” Serané said, tapping her fingers against her chin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s back to work in two minutes,” Kariya finished. “Don’t get too comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  missed the way Kaname stiffened to her touch, already turning away and  grumbling at Kariya’s words. There was nothing to worry about, after  all.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Well, that’s done for one day,” Momomi said, stretching as they walked away. “I can’t believe how long it took.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe if you’d worked harder.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, forgive me,” Momomi pouted. “I’m not like you, an obsessive freak for physical activity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  Kariya’s still a sadist,” Momomi said. “It took so damn long! And the  clock tower, all those stairs, and she made us clean every tiny nook  and cranny. It’s ridiculous. The worst thing, though? Isn’t that the  way she just sat there and watched us for duration, and shouted orders  from time to time? You’d think she’d have something better to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You would… But it’s expected of Kariya.” Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets, frowning up at the sky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glared at her and changed the subject. “And Amiki and Olesa… those two  definitely freak me out. I should have been more thorough, but I know  it now, anyway. Their manner isn’t normal. Don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,” Kaname said. She walked steadily towards the dorms, a little ahead of Momomi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amiki’s  loyalty goes far beyond mere respect for a dominant friend. There’s a  reason there. I’ll find it out. And that reminds me, Olesa and me. What  do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure you’ll be very happy together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  that, idiot.” Momomi pouted. “You shouldn’t even suggest something as  disgusting as that. I mean this mysterious thing that’s between us.  Serané’s so damn ambiguous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you can ask her, can’t you?” Kaname said. “That or your good friend Shion. Don’t look at me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I get it, already,” Momomi said. “I’m just making conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She glanced at Kaname, catching the girl staring moodily ahead. <em>What’s  up with her? She’s such a strange girl. She’s been this way for an  hour, now. I don’t get it. But I can’t just ask her, she’d just deny  everything. Well, whatever. After saying such embarrassing things  earlier, I don’t intend to let her off like this</em>. She brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes.“Are you angry or something? You’re being unusually sensitive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  there’s definitely something wrong! You’re not normally this annoying!”  Momomi looked sidelong at her, scowling. “It’s annoying! So tell me  already, I can’t stand it when you’re getting on my nerves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked dangerous for a moment, then something snapped and she broke  into a smile. “I suppose I have hurt your pathetically vulnerable  feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get too cocky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The same to you, to  think anything you could do would upset me,” Kaname retorted. “I’m just  pissed off at having to do so much manual labour when there’s no decent  reason. Well, this is what I get for saving you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least a  musclehead like you is used to all the physical labour.” Momomi smiled,  relieved. This was better. This was the Kaname she knew. It might sound  weird that she was glad about that, but she was. “Some of us are better  at thinking than tramping around doing hard things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Some of us can do both, though. Isn’t that best?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  if you can’t deal with people. Some of the things you said were  completely nonsensical, and you managed to offend just about everyone  at some point or other. Are you deliberately inept?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s  better than an awkward silence or something crap like that,” Kaname  replied. “I have a gift for keeping conversations moving… but it’s like  one of those geeky pen and paper things, isn’t it? I put all my point  thingies in the important things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ignoring the boxes marked  manners, morals, social ability, self-preservation, that kinda thing,”  Momomi said. “Oh, and sensibility. Your random metaphors are too much  proof of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Totally.” Momomi pouted again, disappointed when Kaname didn’t take her latest little flourish further. <em>Damned if I’m going to tell her that, though.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  had returned to a brooding silence, which was annoying. Momomi didn’t  know why, but it was fine. Sometimes you needed a little space in your  head to think things through. She, of all people, understood that. <em>Besides,  chasing after Kaname’s thoughts is a waste of time. She’s never going  to let me in that easily. Well, we’re both strong, it’s fine. </em>“You know, I haven’t done my history either,” she remarked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, I didn’t even pay attention in the lesson,” Momomi said. “I had too many things to think about. How about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes we’re too alike.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed. “That’s typical of us, really. This could be quite  troublesome.” She shrugged. “Well, let’s get back and begin. It’s not  like we ever have anything else to do in our evenings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speak for yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excuse me? What do you do? Sit around on the bed all day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s a pastime. I’d rather do that than have homework.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll never understand your ability to do nothing for an extended duration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes that’s all that can be done. But I do this thing called sitting and thinking, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah, whatever.” Momomi shook her head. “You think too much. I bet if I  told that to anyone else in our year, no one would believe me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, they’re all stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re going to have to deal with them in the end, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t want to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lazy girl. Honestly. You could be so popular if you just applied yourself…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s too much of a bother,” Kaname said. “That’s what I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.” Momomi stretched idly, cursing her aching arms. “Let’s get back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked back across the yard in silence, a slight breeze blowing through  their hair. There were a lot of students around them, but Momomi didn’t  pay attention to them. They weren’t interesting or relevant, yet. All  the same, she fancied that Kaname and her together cut interesting  figures like this. <em>Not that anyone is going to notice. Like Amiki’s  nonsense. Unlike Kaname, I personally hope that the girl will spread it  around. Hell, I’ll encourage her if that’s what it takes, using reverse  psychology of course. It doesn’t take more than a rumour of the  so-called “forbidden love” to make dozens of fangirls squeal. The only  annoying that is that we’re still so young. The lower years appear to  go gooey in direct proportion to the age gap between themselves and  their beloved, impressive senpais. I’ve always found that ridiculous.  It’s pretty immature, really, an obsession with those above you because  you aren’t satisfied with those equal to you, and by extension,  yourself. And the senpais, too… I don’t approve of that kind of  relationship, though I’ve seen a few around. It’s too much people  seeking for things they thought they’d lost or didn’t have, perhaps.  Serané and Kariya, at least, stood as equals, true equals. If that  wasn’t the case, it would be stupid, just the same as the worse kind of  romances I occasionally read where the heroine is so hopeless and  dependant on a strong male. I can’t respect girls like that, or even  men who respected girls like that. Ultimately, everyone should be able  to stand alone. Only then can you stand with someone else. Doesn’t that  sound dramatic?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>All the same, us being seen as a couple  could be useful. It’d make us interesting. But… it’d be pretty  embarrassing. I don’t know whether I could actually pretend, or give a  straight answer when pressed. </em>Momomi laughed. <em>Pretty childish  of me, really. It’s just acting, isn’t it? But I guess I just find the  concept too ridiculous to contemplate. It’d feel… wrong? I’m not sure.  Would Kaname bear that part, I wonder? Could I convince her? Or would  her furious denials work well enough anyway?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s so funny?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was thinking about how ridiculous our peers can be, that’s all.” Momomi  smiled. “You have a point, you know. I forget some times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Kaname looked away again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  watched her out of the corner of her eye, noting the way the breeze  ruffled her blue hair and left it tangled over her forehead. Of course,  her own hair faired far worse, it was one of the weaknesses of having  it so long, and in a more intricate style. But somehow she was still  used to the idea of having neater hair than Kaname. Her friend was so  casual that she always had a sense of being ruffled. Not just her hair,  but generally. She was even worse than usual today, which wasn’t  exactly surprising. “You definitely need to take a shower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just sighed. “I know, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  a proper one, too,” Momomi teased. “Not just one of those ones you take  with cold water for five minutes so you can say to me you’ve showered  the next morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll only pester me into taking a proper one anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not today. I have to take your uniform to the dry cleaners and borrow a spare one for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  way too fastidious,” Kaname complained. “It’s all a waste of time to  me. A piano is a piano, even if you put a sheet on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But a beautiful flower is even better in a fine vase, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname managed to avoid blushing by the skin of her teeth, making Momomi giggle again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,” Kaname said, breaking the silence after a while. “You know-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well…  I was going to- ask,” Kaname sighed, took a breath, then spoke again,  more confidently this time. “How do you manipulate people?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “What’s all this? That’s a pretty generalised question, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I don’t know how to put it. You know that I’m not great with people  things. I understand the principles… but I can’t execute it. How do you  do it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s like all the things you said yourself,”  Momomi said thoughtfully. “Like war. But basically, I try and work out  what my enemy is like. Their strengths. Their weaknesses. I’ll attack  their weaknesses and the aim is always to erode their strengths. As for  my method, talking works best. With some people, like Olesa, it’s a  matter of business. But with some you have to be more casual and retain  a pretence of normality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you just say anything that will take root?” Kaname started up the stairs, glancing back at her companion for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  not exactly. Changing someone outright is too drastic. It’s not that  easy, either, unless I know someone really well. Like with Olesa, you  know? I didn’t know what I was talking about.” Momomi smiled. “I just  threw enough mud at the wall. But I’ll tell you something interesting.  If a person’s uncertain, it doesn’t even matter if you’re accurate.  They’ll let you talk and they’ll listen. That’s why I can tell, Olesa’s  an uncertain soul at heart.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right.” Momomi glanced at her, looking worried. “Why all the questions? Did Olesa say some weird things?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh… no,” Kaname said. “Not really. Nothing important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s okay then.” Momomi frowned but moved on. “I talked to Amiki, you  know, but I couldn’t get through at all. She trusts Olesa absolutely,  and I don’t know why. It’s not something I can shake.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Kaname frowned, looking ahead again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  good, because she’s a challenge,” Momomi said casually. “I’ll crack  her, I’ll get them both. Messing with people’s heads, it’s a thrill,  really. It’s a way to exert power. I guess in that respect I’m no  different from you and your violence. It’s not something we should be  proud of… but it’s fun, right? Because we’re good at it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Kaname pushed open the door to their room and walked forwards, falling onto her bed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Strip,” Momomi ordered brazenly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  ma’am,” Kaname said sarcastically, taking off her jacket and throwing  it to the brown-haired girl as fast as she could. She unbuttoned her  shirt and followed up by passing that over as well, before folding her  arms over her chest. “Fine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,” Momomi said, oblivious to  her friend’s tension. “I’ll be back in a few minutes. I expect you to  be in the shower then, okay? Still there, I mean. No skipping on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  got it,” Kaname sighed. She walked into the bathroom, undressing the  rest of the way and stepping into the shower. She turned it on and  leaned against the wall, limbs shivering slightly as bitterly cold  water flowed over her tired limbs. But the biting, icy sensation suited  her right now. She was too tired, too hot, too exhausted. She leaned  against the wall, blue hair moistening and sticking to her forehead. It  fell over her eyes. She tried to brush it out of the way, but it fell  back under the steady stream of water. She sighed deeply, shifting her  head out of the way. It was fine as it was. Now the cold water washed  over her shoulders and down her back, bringing out the aches and pains  of a dozen bruises. Her hands were smarting where she’d punched the  others. Her body was battered all over, her spine was killing her where  Amiki had hit her repeatedly with her damn kinetic tackles, and she’d  even stubbed her toes from one too many kicks. All those sensations  were all-too familiar to her. She’d felt them before, so many times.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What was new… that would be Olesa’s words. And Momomi. Just generally, Momomi. <em>You  make me so uncertain. You make this so hard. It’s a question that a  normal person wouldn’t ask, but I’m not a normal person, and I have to  know. I know you too well, I know myself too well, to be confident that  our relationship is what it seems. I say we’re enemies, over and over  again. Do I really think that? No, I might be right. Is it possible for  someone like me and someone like her to ever be anything but that? The  distance between us is just so vast. On the other hand, all through  this time, slowly but surely, I’ve become comfortable with this. When  Momomi says friend I say foe, but is that just me and my comfort zones?  It’s just denial so I can still kid myself that I’m safe inside  myself…no, it’s worse than that. I’m like someone who fantasises about  rape. I can say all the way that this isn’t want I want, but really I  want her to be a friend, a close friend, something. It’s just a way of  making myself feel innocent, even in my guilt. </em>Kaname remembered  herself and pushed off the wall, turning and stepping back to let the  water run down the front of her body, washing away the sweat and grime  and traces of dried blood. <em>Such an unpleasant image is right for  someone like me. Momomi, on the other hand… can I trust her words? She  doesn’t hide what she is, after all. That would be a sickeningly ironic  thing. She, calling me a friend, considering me a foe. And I’m the  reverse. Could I live with that? It’s something I’d have to hide  forever, or she’d know just how much power she has over me. She’d  destroy me. I don’t want to be Amiki. I don’t want to be reduced to  that. That’s even worse than the alternative, which is to be alone and  betrayed once again. And my greatest fear is that I’d become Amiki out  of my own free will.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And that other thing…</em>Kaname  raised a hand, watching the water splash over her fingers. Just  thinking about it made her all too hot, all too furious with herself,  deep inside. <em>I’m in far too deep. This is far too dangerous. I  can’t carry on, not like this, not with my feelings so close to  exposure and Olesa free to screw over my mind, over and over again. I  can’t bear it any more. But I don’t know what to do. Because… I can’t  tell her. There. I said it. When I look at her smile and wonder whether  it’s real or mirror glass, I can’t say anything at all. And that leaves  me lost. What’s left? What should I do now? I’m so strong that I never  ask for help, but my path, my life, something straight and true. I  can’t see it now. So where does that leave me?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey! Kaname! I’m back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname took a ragged breath. “A few more minutes!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine,” Momomi said through the door. “That’s good, take your time. At least this way you’ll get clean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If only you knew.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  leave your new clothes on your bed. Take as long as you like, now that  you’ve finally grasped the concept of a decent shower. Must be all my  lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>How hard it is now just to look you in the face.</em></span></p>
