<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Several  reviewers reflected on Kaname being impatient or not, which was  interesting. I'm glad the characters are at least worth discussing. My  interpretation is through another word the others use a lot about her-  dishonest. Ironically, she's mostly straight-talking with others, but  with herself, as several of you have noted, she is incredibly  deceptive. I'm enjoying that, and shredding that slowly.</span></p>

When  Momomi arrived, Amane was in the same place as yesterday, quietly and  contentedly eating her breakfast. This time, however, Momomi walked  straight up to her and nodded. “Good morning.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked up briefly. “Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sat next to her, folding her legs neatly. “You know, I’ve been thinking  since yesterday. Eating out here like this hardly suits your  reputation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged carelessly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I mean, it’s not like you couldn’t eat in your room if you felt you had to get away from other people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My room is awkward.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “It is?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  roommate confessed to me a few months ago. Since then, things have been  difficult.” Amane’s face hadn’t changed, and she ate her rice as if she  hadn’t said anything at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Momomi processed this,  wondering why Amane was opening up all of a sudden. “I can understand  how that might be awkward.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. It’s not unlike your situation, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh. So that’s why. </em>“I suppose so,” Momomi agreed. “But Kaname is still my friend, and I still enjoy spending time with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane glanced at her briefly. “But it appears I have inconvenienced you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Inconvenienced me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou was not without resentment when she spoke of me, or so I have been told. I was not there to see it myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So the whole school knows, is it?” Momomi sighed. “We could have picked a better place and time for that argument, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if Kenjou isn’t romantically interested in you, she certainly sounds possessive. And rather jealous of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s just the way things are,” Momomi replied. “Kaname is an… intense  person. I like that about her. But the situation’s been  over-dramatised. We’ve had worse rows, and we moved past this one  pretty easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou is an unusual friend to you.” Amane  closed her eyes. “To me, attempting to remain close to someone who  thinks about me in that way… it doesn’t come easily to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  simple, isn’t it? I’m trying hard to act as if I’ve never said  anything, and she just has to stay as a friend to me.” Momomi frowned  worriedly. “She’s never said she has a problem with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if  you pretend, your feelings would be different from mine. I would be  aware of that. Things have changed, and pretence won’t help anything. I  find it difficult.” Amane frowned. “People are very difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  Kaname isn’t like that. I suppose I should be glad that she’s so  possessive. At least she still cares. I’d hate it if my… weirdness,  drove her off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gave her an uncertain glance.  “You’re not… against that kind of thing, are you, Amane-san? You never  struck me as the type, but then again, you’re from a traditional  family.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a natural thing. As natural as any other.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Acknowledging that is not the same as you liking or disliking it, Amane-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged again. “I don’t have a strong opinion either way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I should have known. What do you have a serious opinion about, actually?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane appeared to consider this. “Horses. I believe I’m informed about horses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see.” Momomi tried not to laugh, mostly because she couldn’t tell  whether or not Amane was being facetious. Like Olesa, she was  impossible to read.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane ignored her laughter with a slightly  pained dignity. “In any case, you’re playing dangerously. Offending  Kenjou too much would be counter-productive. I’m not even sure why you  are venturing this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Having cold feet?” Momomi smirked. “That’s fine. I’ll go away if you want.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wasn’t the question.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, aware she was being lead again. “I wasn’t aware there was a question.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let me state it plainly, then. Why are you doing this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  are you doing this?” Momomi frowned and looked at the sky. “Even if you  ask that, I don’t think I have a simple answer. Olesa said it might  make Kaname jealous… but I guess that was never my personal reason.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced at her. “Mostly, I wanted to feel that I was doing something.  And I guess this is still that to me. Even if we row, I’ll enjoy that  in a strange way, I think. By falling out, patching things up, and  moving on… it gives me something else to think about. In a way, it’ll  let me move on from my own feelings, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If life was that simple, yours would be a fickle affection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  blinked at that reply. “Well, perhaps you’re right. But shouldn’t I  wish for a fickle affection of mine in a situation like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  frowned and didn’t reply for a few seconds. “Even if in pragmatic terms  that is true, it still sounds strange. Your emotions are a hope, a  aspiration of something closer. Even if they pain you, giving them up  represents something lost. In the same way an abandoned dream is  something lost, however unrealistic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi leaned forwards.  “You know, that’s quite hypocritical of you. You say that you dislike  those who fall for you, but you idealise those unrequited feelings.  Don’t you just enjoy the attention while pretending it’s annoying for  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe.” Amane glanced at the sky herself. “But if it is  difficult for me, I can respect their feelings. They are a dream, an  aspiration, a desire that the world should be changed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone has dreams. What’s so special about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dreams are important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed. “Sentimental, aren’t you? Dreams are just that, dreams. Idle  fancies, whether they come by night or die. Even if you struggle and  pour all your hope and heart into them, something that nebulous won’t  ever reward you. They keep people struggling through life, no more. And  then you’re betrayed when you die.” Momomi leaned back. “Well, that’s  how I see dreams, anyway. They’re nice, sure… but I’ll quote a good  friend and say the world isn’t that convenient. It’s better to be  realistic about life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane was silent for a few moments before she spoke again. “Kenjou’s dream came true. Your dream came true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou  came to this school. You remained at this school. Struggle actualised  your aspirations, but it was the aspiration which came first and  motivated the struggle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Well, yes, but just  look at Kaname’s scholarship. For that single place, there were  probably hundreds of applicants. But hers was the only dream to come  true. Life is cruel like that. In the end, it’s selection, not  aspiration that decides things. It’s the same… even if I wish for  Kaname to return my feelings, that won’t happen. It’s a decided thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nonetheless,  dreams are what create movement. That many fail is beside the point, as  some succeed. Human struggle and human achievement… Kenjou’s talent and  your force of will… qualities decide matters. But without aspiration,  ability does not move.” Amane shrugged. “That’s why you should hold  onto your feelings. They are your strength.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned again, fiddling with her hair. <em>Wait,  did I just have a deep, meaningful conversation with Amane, of all  people? Even if she’s still speaking in the same dull way, everything  she’s saying…it’s hard to grasp. And hard to argue with. She has a  manner of speaking that suggests everything is settled. This would  definitely count as a serious opinion, too, but where did it come from?  Her friend who fell in love with her? I suppose she has plenty of time  to think about such complicated things. But even so, she’s still an  enigma to me. Where did that feeling come from? And where does it go  when she’s spending most of her time?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane finished her breakfast and pushed herself up. “We should feed the horses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”  Momomi followed her, staring at the back of Amane’s neck as if hoping  it would enlighten her. “You think about this kind of thing a lot,  don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed, sensing that the  conversation was over. “Well, I’ll continue to see you for now. Like my  friends said, if Kaname won’t even let me do this there’s probably  something wrong with our relationship anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,  aren’t you the one who is more inconvenienced? Students armed with  silly rumours are already pestering me. The kind that might annoy you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m indifferent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”  Momomi picked up a handful of hay. “This is one heck of a thing to be  indifferent too, you know. You do know what I mean, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. That’s why I’m indifferent.” Amane patted Starbright on the nose. “There, there. How are you this morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  tried to ignore this rare display of humanity and focus on the matter  in hand. “I wish I knew where you got that casual attitude from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  wish to be attached to Kenjou. I have no such wish to be attached to  anyone. Rumours do not inconvenience me. In fact, they are useful,  provided I do not have to substantiate them with action.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  reached for more hay. “So, basically, you’re using me so it appears  you’re interested in me. That makes your fangirls back off a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That is not my intention, merely a beneficial example of collateral.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Momomi frowned. “Even so, you really don’t care about these things, do you? I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  fed Sol, watching the horse chew on the hay with every appearance of  satisfaction. “So… if dreams are so important, what are your dreams,  Amane-san? To become a great horse breeder and rider?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stopped for a moment. “I have no dreams.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what?” Momomi smiled. “You have a penchant for the dramatic, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. There must be something, right? Even for you, there must be  something you want to achieve. You can’t tell me you think anything  else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “How about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about me?  Well, you dress up my feelings as a dream, which is a little dramatic  too… I guess they have that much chance of being requited, though.” She  laughed shortly. “As for the rest, I want to live an independent life,  here in Japan. I want to go to a good university and study law, and  then I’ll become a lawyer and bring in enough money to live in mild  opulence here. Beyond that, not much, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  Not much interest in my aspirations to the upper-middle class? Well, I  suppose in my case it’s more of a coming down gently… but whatever.  I’ve given you a fair answer.” Momomi folded her arms and glanced back  at Amane. “So tell me. What do you want? Even if it’s stupid, it’s not  like I’ll laugh or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. I have no dreams.” Amane patted Starbright again. “I have no reason to lie to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, why? Everyone wants something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have received much, and I want nothing. I have found no conviction deep enough to move me. I have never had to move.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced back at her. “You know, Kaname hates that kind of attitude from  someone like you. She says everything you have is wasted on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.  She may be right.” Amane didn’t look round. “Time has passed,  Phareli-san. You would do well to go and eat your breakfast now. I can  handle the rest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded uncertainly. “Okay, you’re right.” She glanced at the blue-haired girl’s back. “Well, see you, Amane-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Goodbye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi walked away, feeling uncomfortable. <em>Did  I upset her, or something? I didn’t think she’d be sensitive enough to  be upset just from that. Especially with her too-cool, apathetic  attitude to everything, which was on full display with all that stuff  about not dreaming. Then again, she may act like that because she is  actually sensitive…I don’t know, I’m not a psychologist. Either way,  I’m confused, and not a little annoyed. She intrudes as much as she  likes with me but she certainly doesn’t like to let me probe her in  return, and she dismisses me freely. It’s cold, to say the least, but I  guess I shouldn’t expect her to be anything like a normal friend. She’s  doing me a favour, after all, so I’ll have to put up with her attitude.  It’s discouraging. </em>Momomi closed her eyes, going over everything that they’d said. <em>But  all the same, I’ve made progress. She’s willing to talk to me, if  nothing else, and apparently I’m even worth her descending from her  cloud long enough to provide warnings. About personal matters, no less,  as if she knew anything about that. But I have to forgive under the  circumstances. And when she talked about dreams, that was surprising.  And quite interesting. It reminded me of Kaname’s rants, a little, I  suppose. A little more dreamy and romanticised, a little less insane,  but it had a similar feel to it. Something of surprising depth and  detail coming from the mouth of someone I associate with neither. Those  were her sincere thoughts. I’m sure of it. I just wish I knew what they  meant, but again, I’m not a psychologist. Well, either way, I have  something to report to the others, but I’m not sure whether I will. It  felt almost… personal, back there. That’s a little surprising, but  maybe she really is just lonely. Either way, I have enough decency not  to discuss everything with the others. Shion can ask questions herself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi dismissed her idle thoughts as she entered the main building and walked quickly towards the canteen. <em>I wonder whether Kaname will be mad again…that’s probably the idea, but I don’t like it. I hope she isn’t too difficult. </em>When  her eyes swept the canteen, though, there was no sign of her  blue-haired friend. She walked up to the table she thought of as theirs  by now. “Hi, guys.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning,” Shion returned pleasantly. “Did you speak with Ohtori-san again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For a while, yeah. Where’s Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion’s lips contracted slightly. “She hasn’t come here. I thought you’d know. Well, she’s always been like that, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  probably training in the dojo, after how badly Kariya-sama showed her  up last might. She’s the type to do stupid things like that.” Amiki  smirked at the thought. “Now that would be funny. But shouldn’t you  know, Kiyashiki? Aren’t you her handler?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “Well,  she didn’t say anything, so I thought she was coming here. She might be  looking up something relating to the scholarship exams, I suppose. She  takes that very seriously.” <em>Yeah, right. I wonder…well, probably best not to think about it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her?  Taking studying seriously? That’s hard to imagine.” Amiki shook her  head. “Knowing her, she just aced the test by being herself, without  actually bothering to work. Everything else if just self-justification.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  Rivera-san,” Shion chided. “Kenjou-kun can work quite hard when she has  to, you know. It’s just that she normally has the motivation and  discipline of a hyperactive cat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, that’s enough backhanded  compliments, you two. That’s my job.” Momomi smiled at the memories.  “In any case, I’m going to get my breakfast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No need.” Olesa pushed a tray towards her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  you two didn’t show, Rivera-san was kind enough to get trays for you  both.” Shion smiled. “Which just goes to show she’s a gentle and sweet  girl despite her tomboy demeanour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know about it? I  just didn’t want a repeat of yesterday’s drama.” Amiki folded her arms.  “I told Kenjou but not you, you two can get quite ridiculous at times.  Don’t do that again, it disturbs Olesa eating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bear that in mind.” Momomi smiled and sat down. “And thank you, Amiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The other girl snorted and looked away. “Don’t get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane didn’t look round, continuing to feed the horses. “Isn’t stalking your friend a bad habit, Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned as she stepped into the barn, folding her arms. <em>It’s not usual for her to even acknowledge me, let alone challenge me. </em>“It’s not like that. I’ve come here before, and I’ll come here again. What does that have to do with Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The fact that you’re here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if she needs my help.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s yourself you’re looking out for,” Amane replied flatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wrong.  I’m here for you. It’s annoying, Ohtori, to see you dragged into my  personal affairs. And it’s probably troublesome for you, as well.”  Kaname leaned against one of the stalls with adopted carelessness.  “Momomi is using you to get back at me. That much is obvious. I don’t  see any good reason for you to get involved. Isn’t it a pain?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then stop. It’s a pain for me, as well. She’s just playing a childish game.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah,” Amane replied vaguely. “Well, I won’t do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  scowled. “Don’t joke around. Are you going to inconvenience everyone  just for that? Hell, why is it even interesting? You’re the most  antisocial person I’ve ever met, so what’s different about Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not mine to say, but yours to know.” Amane fed a horse some more straw, patting it on the nose. “Good boy…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname ground her teeth. “At least face me when I’m talking to you, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s only polite.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname tried to restrain her rising irritation. “That’s a child’s tactic, you know, to question everything pointlessly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, it’s bothering me.” Kaname narrowed her eyes. “I suggest you stay away from her from now on. As a favour.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time, Amane looked at her, red eyes cold. “You’re playing too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just blinked, trying to work out what the hell she meant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  Kiyashiki-san is playing a childish game, you, too are indulging  yourself in that. By coming here, and speaking to me, by acknowledging  that this bothers you, by trying to end it… you are playing just like  her.” Amane turned away again, walking up the stalls. “When you argued  with her over this, that was the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what am I supposed to  do? Suffer in silence?” Kaname snapped. “I love her as a friend but  not… anything more. Why the hell should I be punished for that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you are just a friend, you can let her be a friend to me as well.  Regardless of her motives, you do not have the right to stop her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  heard that before, and I don’t give a damn. I’m not asking for  permission.” Kaname’s voice raised in anger, a feeling intensified by  Amane’s aura of calm. “What do you know about us, anyway? I’ve <em>suffered </em>for  that girl. I’ve told her a lot and listened to a lot and fought to  protect her and supported her against her family. Even now, I’m working  my ass off to help her with the scholarship exams. That’s more right to  her than anyone else has.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If that’s all there is, you have an  unhealthy relationship, do you not? But I suspect she has given as much  as she has taken. In any case, exact equality is not necessary between  you.” Amane, her face in profile, smiled slightly. “That is a  misconception you both suffer from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t tell me what bloody misconceptions I suffer from. You’re not someone who knows anything about friendship!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s true.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared at her. “You should remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But even I know that you cannot own another person. That is simple, no?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be melodramatic! I’m just sick of her socialising prettily with my  rival just to spite me for feelings I’d never be able to return! If you  think that’s unreasonable, you’re the one with misconceptions!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t get agitated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Don’t you <em>dare </em>tell me what to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Far  be it from me to do that.” Amane shrugged. “Nonetheless, I disagree  with you. Kiyashiki-san has every right to do this, and you do not have  the right to stop her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t see any judges around her,”  Kaname growled. “I can do what I damn well please, and you don’t have  the right to stop me. I’m just talking, Ohtori.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Amane turned to face her again. “Then let’s talk, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, a little taken aback by her tone. <em>It’s direct… assured…and her eyes aren’t wavering. Is this the person she really is? </em>“Everything I want to say to you, I’ve already said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  conversation, like a relationship, is a two-way street. I still have  things to say to you.” Amane folded her arms. “To Momomi, her feelings  for you are a burden she has placed on you. She is ashamed of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blinked slightly, cut by her words. “What? What do you know about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Enough to know. How she speaks about them… they are weird, unnatural, and so on. That’s what she says.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  screw with me! You wouldn’t know, but Momomi isn’t someone who is ever  ashamed of who she is!” Kaname gave her a cold look. “<em>I know who I am. </em>That’s what she told her father. And that took more guts than you’ll ever show in a lifetime!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Saying  and believing are two different things. And those feelings in general  are not the same as her becoming attached to a specific person.” Amane  frowned. “I told you this because you should know, Kenjou. Denial won’t  help anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve never held it against her,” Kaname replied,  raising her folded arms defensively. “She should know that. And if she  feels like that, all she has to do is say!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why aren’t you the one planning to say something to her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  what am I supposed to say? Won’t that just embarrass her even more?”  Kaname leaned back. “She should know, so I shouldn’t have to say  anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When you speak, Kenjou, my impression of you the  opposite of the one you claim.” Amane looked at her with hostile eyes.  “You claim the right to restrict her actions, and you leave her to do  everything, letting presumption take the place of consideration for her  feelings. You take and take. To this day, I have never understood what  a person like you has to give.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what do you know? You tell  me that, Ohtori!” Kaname stepped forwards angrily, hands dropping from  her chest and shifting subconsciously into a fighting stance. “We’ve  struggled, together, and we’ve done it our way! Not your way, not the  Etoile’s way, but our way! I could care less if you don’t understand or  if it isn’t convenient for you! I don’t hold her hand and she doesn’t  hold mine, but we’re still friends. That’s what we share! You can say a  lot of things, Ohtori, but you have no right to tell me I am not a  friend to Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane closed her eyes for a moment. “Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  about you? What do you have, Ohtori?” Kaname snapped forwards,  infuriated, and grabbed the girl by her neck. “Look at me! What the  hell will you give her? Popularity? Polite conversation, a horse, and  the idolatry of the masses? Is that what friendship is to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  glanced impassively at her, apparently unaware that she had practically  been lifted off the floor. “Being used, I serve a purpose. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glared at her for a moment, then dropped her. “You make me sick.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane kept her gaze steady. “If nothing else, Kenjou, you have passion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be too surprised. You don’t know who I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t know me, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’m getting a rough idea, and I don’t like it at all.” Kaname returned  her stare. “Momomi is my friend, my business. You don’t have any place  in that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane said nothing for a few moments. “So, you are her friend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No more? Just a friend?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course!” Kaname retorted, rather more certainly than she actually felt.  “It’s not like I’m happy, either, but that’s the way it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, then, if you are her friend, I will ask for your help.” Amane glanced at her. “I would like to date Phareli-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just stared for a very long moment, trying to process that statement without going completely ballistic. “You want what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. I would like to be romantically involved with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s fists balled. “Stop screwing around! I came to tell you to keep the hell away from her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  something I intend to pursue, with or without your permission.” Amane’s  voice was, as ever, perfectly calm. “Kiyashiki-san is an interesting  person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you can do what you like. In case you haven’t noticed, she likes me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  I will just have to win her. That may take some time, but I’m a patient  person.” Amane gave her an almost puzzled glance. “I was hoping you  could help me, though, Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname took a deep breath. <em>I  wish I was a dragon. Then the most annoying, arrogant, presumptuous,  feckless, impolite and intrusive person I’ve ever met would be so much  ash, here and now. </em>“Why the hell would I help you take her from me even more?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  it would be convenient for you both.” Amane closed her eyes. “Kiyashiki  could forget her feelings for you and reconcile herself with the fact  that being attracted to girls is not always harmful. You will gain some  relief from the difficulties currently plaguing her. Everyone wins.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The problem here is that she’s spending far too much time with you! How would you two being… like that, help me at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed. “You’re certainly a possessive friend. Oh, well. I’ll do it alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  I’ll let you.” Kaname was vaguely aware that the bell had rung long  since but she didn’t give a damn. “I’m not going to let just anyone  play on her feelings, especially after a rejection. Least of all you!  You’re the last person worth her time!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then who is worth her time?” Amane folded her arms when no reply came. “In any case, it’s nothing to do with you, Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The hell it isn’t! I’m her best friend!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki  is intelligent enough to make her own decisions. You acknowledged that  when you helped her against her parents.” Amane closed her eyes again.  “Your friendship is between you and her. But my relationship with her  is also between myself and her. You’re not involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you  expect me to believe that?” Kaname folded her arms herself, fingers  twitching. “Forget it, Ohtori. I know her. You don’t. That’s the  difference between us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know her, that’s true. But I  know of her, and I would like to know her better. Besides, she  approached me, not the other way round. She began everything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  admitted she’s using you, so you aren’t allowed to go further than  that.” Kaname resisted the temptation to attack her again. “That’s  clear, isn’t it? I hate things as they are now! I definitely won’t let  you go any further?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because I’m a good friend!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A good friend would determine her friend’s feelings first, before making any sweeping judgements.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know her feelings, unlike you, because I know her. She likes me and  she’d never fall for someone like you. Clinging to your money and  gentility… you’re the opposite of her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps that’s true. If  she rejects me, it’s a completed matter.” Amane opened her eyes again.  “But I should be allowed a fair chance. If you’re so confident in your  beliefs, you wouldn’t have any problems with that, would you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m confident, believe me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then don’t interfere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bit her lip, feeling frustrated. “Someone like you doesn’t even deserve a fair chance…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a poor excuse. What’s your objection, Kenjou? Surely a good <em>friend </em>should be glad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re my objection!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san  plainly does not hold me in as much contempt as you do. I told you  before, Kenjou, it’s not your judgement to make.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll make my own judgements.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed deeply. “Then there’s nothing more to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. I was finished a long time ago.” Kaname glowered. “The rest of this conversation was a waste of my time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane took off her riding coat and hung it on a nearby hook, picking up her blazer and putting it on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now listen carefully, Ohtori. Stay away from Momomi. She’s not yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll make her mine.” Amane spoke coldly, harshly, her eyes emotionless but somehow… savage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  was momentarily paralysed by that, suffering under the gaze of an ice  prince. Then Amane stepped past her without another word and left the  stable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname remained there for a few moments, battling with  the emotions boiling in her stomach. As ever, she lost, punching a post  and hurting her arm. “That bitch! What the hell is she doing, speaking  so arrogantly? God, I won’t forgive her, I won’t forgive her, I won’t  forgive her… I swear, if she so much as touches Momomi I’ll snap her in  half and throw her beneath her own horse! No, I’ll do that anyway! Who  is she to talk to that? I don’t care what she says! I won’t let her! I  won’t let her! I won’t let her!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Starbright whinnied as she  paused for breath, uncurling her hands again and almost experimentally  pressing her palms against her face. It was boiling hot. <em>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! </em>She punched the post again, enjoying the pain. “I won’t… I won’t let her…” She took a ragged breath. <em>What  the fuck is this? Coming all to pieces? Am I that bloody scared of  Amane? God, even if I don’t know what that was, I’m not afraid of her!  I’m the one who knows Momomi! I’m not afraid!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>What do I have to be afraid of, anyway?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  hated that voice. But she was going to change its name. From now on, it  was called Amane, after the worst, most stuck-up, egocentric,  antisocial, obsessive, pathological, twisted, scheming, conniving,  malicious… popular, clever, beautiful… she gave up. <em>I’m not sure  whether I want to destroy something or sleep for a week. Either would  be an escape from this agonising anger. Fuck! It’s the way she speaks…  I’m not going to let anyone talk about Momomi that way…and she says I  treat her like I own her… she’s just too… so…god. It’s wrong. It’s all  wrong. </em>Kaname kicked the post for good measure, hissing with rage  at the pain. Then she turned and staggered out of the stables, heading  blindly through the forest. <em>Screw this, screw breakfast, screw it  all. Screw her. That’s right, screw her. Because she wants to screw  Momomi. Why? Why the fuck is it her and her? What kind of bloody sense  does that make? They barely know enough other, it’s just wrong. I won’t  accept it. There’s nothing to accept. Momomi likes me, after all. She  said that. Amane doesn’t stand a chance. I won’t let her have a chance.  No way. She doesn’t deserve it. Not after she talks about my Momomi  like that. My as a friend. Not property. I don’t own her. And I give as  well, I give a lot! It’s been hard, sometimes. That was just nonsense.  Convenient for her. She probably said it to screw with me. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Yeah,  that’s right. She must see me as a rival now, in this perverted way.  Whatever I say, people will see that possibility. And I’ll stop her  anyway! But is that… because…no. She might be leading me. Perhaps she’s  leading me. Is she screwing around and hoping that I’ll get mad because  I… well…but that can’t be it. Right? She was so forceful. Besides, what  is she going to think? I’m getting mad, I’m reacting just like she’d  want me too, if that was the case…but not for the reasons she thinks. I  think. What do I know? Surely I should know. Fuck Amiki. What does she  know? She’s my only friend. My important, first friend. Of course I’m  possessive… what’s wrong with that? Is that so bad? What do I have to  give? What could I give… what do I want to give? It all comes down to  that. Even if Amane says all that, I’m the one who accepts things as  they are, to everyone else, it’s give and take, this and that, a trade.  Be my girlfriend and have this much of my time. Be my best friend and  have less, friends even less… it’s a fucking hierarchy. I don’t believe  in that shit. I just want to be with Momomi. Is that so wrong? Why is  everybody bloody judging me? What’s their bloody problem? Do they hate  me that much?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled and bit her lip hard, hard enough to pain her. <em>Fuck.  I’m a miserable wreak. What’s up with that? Fuck. This pisses me off.  I’m not going to think. I don’t need to think. There’s nothing to think  about…there’s nothing to worry about. That’s all. </em>She looked around, forcing her mind to normalcy. <em>I hope a sister doesn’t find me…well, I could care less, actually. I could do with something else to be annoyed about. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It’s difficult to think about all this.</em></span></p>
