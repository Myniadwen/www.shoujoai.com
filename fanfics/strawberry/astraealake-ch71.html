<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Confession:  this fic is now so long not even I can keep track of what went down on  paper and what stayed in my head. On that note, does the story of  Amane's roommate sound familiar to everyone? I can't for the life of me  remember whether or not that made it from grey matter to words on the  page.</span></p>

Momomi glanced at herself in the mirror, frowning at her loose necktie. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m getting sloppy. Now, more than ever before, I have to look good.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before she could do anything, Kaname drew it tighter. “Like that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very good,” Momomi agreed, touching the tie idly. “Like that, you could almost pass for normal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  you’re still a vain perfectionist,” Kaname retorted, stepping back and  inspecting her own reflection. “Even so. Ready for battle, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ready  for battle, indeed… everything has to be military with you.” Momomi  smiled. “But still, you’re finally taking pride in your appearance, are  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. I’m just going through the motions because you’d complain to me if I didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you want to look good for me? That’s very sweet, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not what I said, but fine.” Kaname prodded her on the cheek. “How about  you? You always dressed well, even before. Just who are you trying to  impress?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I don’t know…” Momomi mused. “God?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God? I doubt that’ll help you much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you can die at any time, right?” Momomi pointed out. “So you should be  well turned-out at all times. Quite apart from the embarrassment of  dying in penguin underpants or suchlike, on the off-chances that God  really does exist I want to be looking my best for Saint Peter. My hope  is that I’ll look beautiful and innocent enough to get by without him  looking at my actual record.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Innocent, is it? Even now, you’re anything but that… have you ever been innocent, I wonder?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a child thing. Everyone thinks children are innocent.” Momomi stretched  idly, flicking a lock of brown hair away from her eyes. “As we said  before, the truth is that children can be ignorant, but they’re never  innocent. That’s not the point, though. I’ll go to Peter and do my  cutest pout and hope for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And when you’re too old for that? What are you going to do? Seduce him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a pretty good idea,” Momomi said. “If there is a God, though, I want to  die young. Old people can’t really use either method.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re presuming a very gullible God, aren’t you? And if he can’t be fooled?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  a long life would be best. As long as possible. In fact, if they  invented immortality in my lifetime, that would suit me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  laughed. “I’ve always wondered about that, actually. What would the guy  do if we invented immortality, anyway? I mean, we’ve already got  disease, the creation of the world and world history covered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If he exists, end the world. If he doesn’t… I don’t know. What is the Roman Catholic Church’s position on immortality?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. But I don’t think they have one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose it’s not strictly necessary just yet,” Momomi observed wryly.  “In any case, though, that’s why I’m always well-dressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bullshit,” Kaname replied affectionately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally. I learned from you, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really? Well, you’re ten years too early to beat me at my own game.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably,  yeah. I can’t say that’s something I’m ashamed of, though…” Momomi  stood on her tiptoes, leaning forwards and kissing Kaname on the cheek.  “But I’ll live with it, I’m sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked away. “Hey, hey. Don’t get too excited early in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On  the contrary, there isn’t much time when you’ll let me get excited,  what with your ever-present apprehension of others.” Momomi stood book,  shaking her head. “Everyone knows we’re together and this has to be one  of the most tolerant environments on the planet. If not here, where?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. Amsterdam?” Kaname turned towards the door. “Come on. If we don’t get going, we’ll be late again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed, walking after her. “Seriously, though. Your shyness is a little  strange, isn’t it? Normally you don’t care what other people think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah,” Kaname admitted. “That’s different. That’s normal, but… how do I say this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everything  else adds to your tough girl image, but you don’t want to kiss your  girlfriend in front of others?” Momomi teased. “That’s a very cute  attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not it at all!” Kaname replied distractedly.  “But it’s still strange, isn’t it? Even for a normal couple, private  life should be private, right? And let’s face it, people don’t always  take kindly to people like us…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not here, though. That’s hardly the point. The main danger around here is that girls will take photos.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unpleasant  mental images ensue.” Kaname shook her head. “But here’s different,  though, isn’t it? Precisely because it’s tolerant. You can’t do the  same kind of thing in other circumstances, so I’m fine with just  keeping things private.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Surely we should enjoy this freedom  while we can precisely because this is unique?” Momomi sighed, shaking  her head. “I get that the Sisters don’t want us all over each other in  school time, but you won’t even hold my hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re such a  girl. Don’t I give you enough attention already?” Kaname shook her  head. “Whenever you’re around to receive it, anyway. Sometimes you’re  flying off with Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So enjoy the time I do give you, as my one and only girlfriend,” Momomi said, taking Kaname’s arm. “What’s wrong with that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop it, already.” Kaname frowned, looking rigidly ahead. “It’s just strange…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed, stepping away and sticking her hands in her pockets. “You’re still a surprising prude. It’s very upsetting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,” Kaname muttered. “I’m just not confident enough yet…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  brightened at that admission. “Oh, really? You should learn fast, you  know. If you don’t let me play around, I get all tense, and we never  get any work done in our revision lunchtimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. That’s not my fault.” Kaname sighed. “You need to learn some more discipline, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you say that so firmly, you don’t do much to help matters, now do  you?” Momomi teased. “You should just loosen up a little.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should tighten up a lot. Either way, we’re both compensating for each  other.” Kaname chuckled. “We should just agree to meet in the middle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Momoland  will not compromise unless progress is made on the affection in public  issue,” Momomi noted. “Until then, the heavy bombing campaigns will  continue.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not compromising either. Can’t you at least be more reasonable about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never!  Victory or death! We won’t stop until Kanada’s last city has fallen,”  Momomi teased. “That’s why you should be scared. Day by day, your  defence weakens.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As ever, you’re persistent to the point of psychosis.” Kaname smiled dryly. “That’s pretty troublesome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know you like it really. And that goes for a lot of things I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Arrogant girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. That doesn’t mean it’s polite to say it, though. That’s something I should say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you never will, so I have to compliment enough for both of us.” Momomi grinned. “You’re cute that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, stop playing around,” Kaname scoffed lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t play around. I’m always deadly serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Perhaps that’s the problem, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stopped for a moment, looking round the canteen. “Say, Kaname. I have a great idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about we queue and get our food normally, without rowing and making a scene, for once in our lives?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like the way you think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled. “That could only be an innovation for people like us…” She  joined the queue, glancing back at her girlfriend at smiling. “A  neutral topic, then. Hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there such a thing, with us?” Kaname mused. “Sounds pretty unlikely to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  should try something a little more neutral before we discuss  complicated things like that,” Momomi teased. “How about, I don’t know,  rabbits?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rabbits?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. Rabbits are cute and fluffy and harmless and innocent. Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’d dispute innocent. The phrase ‘going at it like rabbits’ has entered  our lexicon, after all.” Kaname smirked. “And that kind of metaphor is  particularly appropriate for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Touché. Well, cute, fluffy, harmless and promiscuous. Rabbits are good, right? Everyone likes rabbits.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You miss some key points, though. They crap everywhere, kick things and have really <em>irritating </em>noses.” Kaname folded her arms. “Personally, I can’t stand the little hairballs. But maybe that’s just me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Yep, that’s probably just you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about money? Money is definitely a firm positive regardless of circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  lot of people would disagree with you, you know,” Momomi teased. “They  say too much money is a stressful burden and also the root of all evil.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  but the people who say that don’t have any money. It’s just  rationalisation.” Kaname chuckled. “I’m more honest. I want to be  filthily, horribly, obnoxiously rich when I grow up. Not that I have a  huge chance of doing so, but it’s the ideal that counts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  fact that money can’t buy happiness is a cliché, I know, but you’re  simplifying things.” Momomi shook her head. “I know my father, after  all. So I wouldn’t have time for anyone who spent so much time on  making money that they didn’t have enough time to spend with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  obviously,” Kaname replied. “A stupid attitude is a stupid attitude,  regardless of the cause. And if amassing money becomes it’s own end,  instead of the means to an end, you’ve screwed up. But that’s not what  I said. Money, in itself, isn’t something you can have too much of. If  you were just given it, say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Except, perhaps, the money that  was given me by my mother, which you completely objected to.” Momomi  shook her head. “But I’d disagree there again. It’s impossible to  separate money from its source, and if it was just handed to you, you  won’t develop as a person, either. That’s what you say, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Kaname confessed. “Well, money is still something you want a lot of in most circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And rabbits have high approval ratings, but not one hundred percent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, whatever. I’d still prefer a nice pair of rabbit-skin gloves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On  that note, they took their breakfasts, walked over to their table, and  sat down. “Good morning, everyone,” Momomi said, smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning, both of you.” Shion shook her head. “As ever, you’re fashionably late. I suppose I’ll have to get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It has nothing to with fashion and everything to do with them being lazy bastards,” Amiki complained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No Amane?” Momomi queried, looking between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I haven’t seen her.” Shion shrugged. “Perhaps she’s ill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  saw her earlier,” Amiki said. “She ordered her breakfast and left, like  she did before. Perhaps she’s worried Starbright is coming down with  stubbed toe or whatever it is these horses catch when they want  attention.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You saw her?” Shion asked. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, actually. I did ask. I very distinctly remember asking, and you just shrugged.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You did?” Amiki frowned. “Oh, right. I guess I wasn’t paying any attention. Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  rubbed her forehead. “You four are infuriating, really. Never has so  much been owed by so few to me, but are you grateful? Not at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re paying back your favours,” Momomi replied. “It’s a zero sum situation, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess I started in the wrong place. Good Christian morals to begin with… you all lack that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you don’t?” Kaname asked sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki smirked. “Come to that, what about-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Making  an exception of the homosexual thing.” Shion shrugged. “Perhaps I’m a  bad person, but if you ask me God has better things to do than worry  about who’s doing who in what position and with what. That’s  irrelevant, though. You’re all very cold and calculating.” She  chuckled. “Which is to say, rather too close to my nature for comfort,  too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite. In any case, mind, it’s strange with Amane.” Momomi frowned. “Did any of you upset her or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  probably just got bored of us and gave up.” Kaname shrugged. “It’s not  like she ever really took part, so you can hardly blame her. But you  can’t blame us, either. She just wasn’t talkative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps we  should have been more inclusive…” Momomi mused, sounding upset. “But it  was difficult, we’re so used to talking like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ohtori-san  prefers listening to talking. You should know that well.” Olesa  shrugged without looking up from her reading. “She has a short  attention span, though. That’s all there is to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki nodded.  “Besides, trying to meet her standards is all but impossible. If all it  took was effort, everyone would be her friend.” She looked at Momomi,  eyes glittering with amusement. “You’re not so special in that respect,  after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up. That’s got nothing to do with it.” Momomi  glared irritably. “It’s just be inconvenient if we have upset her  somehow, that’s all. Her fangirls would make us pay for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you can angst with her later, or whatever. It’s not like you won’t be seeing her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname!” Momomi complained. “You should be more sympathetic. You don’t have to take pot-shots at her all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I doubt she’d care whether you came or went,” Kaname replied. “She’s  too damned impassive. That’s what pisses me off the most.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure she cares more than that. She just tries to be tough, like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not like I planned my tough girl act from the start. I did it because I  had no other choice.” Kaname snorted. “But Amane has more chances than  I ever had, day after day. So that kind of excuse doesn’t cut much ice  with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki shook her head slowly. “With you, though, I’m  almost sure you’d continue to be a tough girl no matter how popular you  were. By now, at least, that’s who you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s unusual for you to think you know about me to say that kind of thing,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  I know you quite well. You’re not unlike me. It’s logical enough.”  Amiki leaned forwards. “But the truth isn’t very convenient for your  argument, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Never mind,” Shion said firmly. “We’ve  gone far enough on that subject. But for all we know, Ohtori-san is  down with a headache and wanted to eat in her room. We shouldn’t read  into things too much just yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine… whatever.” Momomi sighed  and cast around for another topic of conversation. Her eyes settled on  Olesa. “Say, what are you reading?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A prospectus on a Spanish private school,” Olesa replied bluntly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Momomi leaned forwards. “You mean you’re <em>serious </em>about leaving the school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m considering all my options. Nothing is decided yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  wrong with just staying here, though?” Momomi demanded. “Even if it’s  for your mother, you can’t always bend at the waist for her, right? You  have to have a life as well. You can’t just keep sacrificing yourself  over and over. And Amiki too! Isn’t that irresponsible?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  touched.” Olesa looked up, smiling. “However, this is a selfish choice  of mine. Selfish, because I know it will burden you three.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh… what?” Momomi flushed. “I just dislike the principle-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so. But this isn’t that principle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  came here for a lot of reasons, but one of them was so we didn’t burden  Olesa’s mother,” Amiki explained. “In any case, I’m not someone you  should worry about. My place is wherever Olesa is, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  either romantic, creepy, or just plain depressing, depending on who you  ask.” Kaname leaned back, biting into a bacon roll. “I’m leaning on  depressing, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, give me one good reason why  you should go?” Momomi demanded. “Aren’t you settled in here? Surely  there has to be something even you two like about this place?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. That’s not the problem, though. Spain is a long way away, and I  intend to be a Spaniard.” Olesa shrugged. “They have better gay rights,  for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And how many private schools will be as accommodating as this school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very few. But I’ll manage it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shook her head. “It just looks irresponsible to me. There’s nothing  wrong with this school, so why go elsewhere? It’ll be a big disruption,  you’ll have to make new friends and the stuff you are learning will be  totally different too. So what’s the point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As I said, it’s  mostly so I can live life in the country I’ll remain at for the rest of  my life.” Olesa looked amused. “In any case, you’re far more sensitive  and worried about this than I’d expected. I appreciate that sentiment,  so bear in mind that I am merely exploring various possibilities.  Nothing is set in stone as of yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that, it’s a silly idea,” Momomi muttered. “And if that’s what I think, I’ll be sure to tell you. That’s all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  fine, isn’t it?” Shion asked. “This is Perez-san’s choice to make. And  Rivera-san too, of course. We’ll support them regardless, so why make  such a fuss?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted. “I told you, I just think it’d be a  bad idea. Besides, it’ll be troublesome if I have to find more people  who think like us after they’re gone. Right, Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  I agree with Shion for once.” Kaname looked at the ceiling. “They’re  going to do whatever they think best anyway. Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally,” Amiki agreed. “Do we ever do anything else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So just let it be. Anything else is an annoying waste of breath.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Whatever you say, it annoys me. But it’s not like any of you are giving my a choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bell rang and they stood, shrugging on their bags and leaving the canteen. Momomi walked towards History in a glum silence. <em>Why are they so casual about this? As if it doesn’t even matter! </em>She huffed her cheeks irritably. <em>Not  just Olesa, I’d expect that of her, but Amiki too. And not just them,  but Shion and Kaname as well. We’re friends, aren’t we? After all this  time, I’d think so. But they’re all talking about those two going half  the world away as if it’s a trivial little thing. How about Isae?  Shouldn’t Shion, of all people, know about this? And when Kaname has so  few friends in the first place, shouldn’t she look after the ones she  has? If we’re talking like this, it makes me feel like it’s all hollow.  I don’t like that at all. Am I the only one who even cares?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good morning, Kiyashiki-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, glancing at Uemura as they passed each other in the corridor. “Good morning…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The first-year smiled at her as they passed each other. Momomi just shook his head in bemused surprise. <em>They’re  very forwards. I’m sure even Kaname wasn’t that cheeky when she was  that age. Or the others, for that matter…except for Shion. She’s a  nonconformist within the system, or something. A rebel with a cause. I  wonder what she was like, actually? The rebellious and innocent Shion,  before she grew into herself. Would Isae recognise her if they met  again? How much would they change? </em>Momomi sighed. <em>I was no  different with Luigia, and even if we write we’re more distant now.  There’s no doubt about that. With those two, it would be the same,  except we don’t even have that much in common in the first place. That  thing which I call our friendship to myself, but never to anyone else,  what is it? Just because we’re similar people, and also because she  made me curious, and her stubbornness annoyed me. I pressed hard, but  she just let things be. When I think about it, she’s never really done  much herself, except tell me I was being a fool with Kaname. And that  didn’t cost her much, after all. Perhaps she still doesn’t value such a  friendship. </em>She walked into her History classroom, sitting down. <em>On  the other hand, one of the only things we have in common is Shion. She  made us do the school play together, and has kept us meeting every  morning. When I think about it, Shion might well be as much an  instigator as I was. But if that’s the case, why is she so quick to let  go? Doesn’t she want to at least argue, or protest? It doesn’t make any  sense to me at all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rested her head on her hand, staring at the board. <em>Or  am I the strange one, for protesting so much? What did I expect, with  people like us? We all have plans, agendas and the self-confidence to  take our own actions. To think that our little ephemeral alliance could  last forever is hopelessly naïve. Even if Olesa stays here for now,  something has to go wrong in the end. Because for all five of us, the  self is a concept that’s more important than anything else. That  includes friendship. I’ve always accepted that, because that’s the  person I am and that’s the people I’m used to dealing with. But it’s  annoying now, all of a sudden. The friends I’ve made, even if they’re  strange friends, even if there’s only five of us, they’re important to  me, because they’re probably my first real friends. But that goes for  Kaname as well, doesn’t it? So why am I the weak one here? </em>Momomi frowned in a melancholy way, feeling uncharacteristically tired. <em>Perhaps I’m just sensitive. But things really will be very different if those two leave…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A few hours of tedium later, Momomi snatched up her bag and headed outside, remembering <em>another </em>troubling development. She ran a hand through her hair as she ran towards the stables, holding it out of her eyes. <em>Damnit.  My life was so peaceful and simple… for all of three days. Between the  play and my apparent tendency to attract chaos and strange people  wherever I go, things are getting very interesting. Of course, it  doesn’t help that I’m a chaotic, strange person. And increasingly I’m  becoming proactive in finding equally weird people, I suppose. But it’s  still troublesome. No one told me that having friends was so much work. </em>She slowed to a walk as she reached the paddock, stepping into the  stables. Amane wasn’t in sight, so she shrugged off her blazer and  switched it for a riding jacket, tying up her hair with the ribbon. <em>Well,  not even Amane can be here all the time. Sometimes I forget that, of  course. Either a teacher’s holding her behind, or she simply runs too  fast. </em>Momomi leaned on Sol’s stall, patting her horse on the neck.  There was an appreciative whinny. “Dou, dou… you’re a good girl, aren’t  you? Did you miss me?” She chuckled. “This must be why Amane prefers  horses. You don’t run off to Spain or disappear, now do you? Well, I  guess I’d achieve the same effect if I locked my friends in little jail  cells and took them out for brief walks every day.” She rubbed Sol’s  nose. “But Amane can get away with this because you’re not human,  right? Isn’t that sweet of her?” Momomi smirked. “Oh, well. It beats  living in the wild, I’m sure. Your healthcare and dietary provision is  better than what most humans on this planet receive, I guess.” Sol  blinked slowly at her, flicking her ears. “Well, either way, social  commentary and conversation isn’t a horse’s strong point, am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was still no sign of Amane, so Momomi stepped away and started to fill the horses’ troughs with hay. <em>She’ll  be sure to thank me for that. I think the well-being of the horses is  more important than her own health. Certainly, if you believe the  rumour about her dragging herself down here to check on them with a  high fever…that was before my time, of course. But from what I know of  her, I could well believe it. </em>A few minutes later, though, all the  horses were eating happily, and there was still no sign of Amane.  Momomi frowned, nonplussed. <em>This is unusual. Something must have  happened, I suppose. Shall I just take Sol out anyway? Or shall I take  Sol for a quick walk and then do Starbright as well? Come to that, they  all must feel neglected now that she’s doing the play. If she’s not  even able to spend the time when they should have her full attention  with her, that’d probably be bad for her. They need to get exercise  everyday, after all, and some of the more casual riders are scandalous  about that. </em>Momomi smirked at the thought. <em>I’m starting to  think like her, actually. When we first met, I just barely knew a  stirrup from a riding crop. Now, thanks to some very detailed lecturing  from a certain fanatic in the field, I’m a lot more informed. Is that a  good thing or not? </em>She began to fit Sol’s saddle, picking up the  heavy leather and lifting it into place. “Now, stand still, like a good  girl. We’ll ride out soon.” The horse was a little skittish. They  tended to be, when Amane wasn’t around. Amane was a rider that inspired  confidence merely by her presence. <em>This possibly has something to  do with horse pheromones. After so long near them, she’s probably  assimilated them, after all. It’s only natural.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. So you’re here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked up, seeing Amane framed in the doorway. “Of course. You’re late,  you know. We only have fifteen minutes left of break.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Amane walked forwards, standing next to Starbright’s stall and petting the horse idly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve fed them all, so there’s nothing to worry about,” Momomi explained. “Just saddle up and we can go out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t be riding right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I said is what I said,” Amane replied impassively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But why?” Momomi shook her head irritably. “To say <em>that isn’t like you </em>is to make the understatement of the century. Besides, Starbright needs to stretch his legs, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll make it up later. Right now, I can’t face the crowds. It’s too troublesome.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked at her with concerned eyes, trying to ignore an excited Sol who  was anticipating her ride outside. “Are you alright? Even if it annoys  you, that isn’t like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you didn’t eat with us this morning, either. What’s up? Did we annoy you about something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing’s wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  snorted. “If you say that while giving up a chance to ride Starbright,  there’s no way I’m ever going to believe you. I’m not stupid. If you  have a problem, tell me. Anything else is just plain annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It has nothing to do with you.” Amane glanced at her briefly. “I’m just… tired. And I need to think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  think aloud,” Momomi reasoned. “This is irritating.” She closed her  eyes, considering what could have set this out. “Is this about  yesterday? It’s not like I’m proud of getting into so many arguments  with Koike, but she was extremely belligerent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not it at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm… does it have something to do with her, though? You left together in the break, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked away, making no reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  stared at her. “Koike? Seriously? You mean you can’t handle that  second-rate sociopath? Just ignore her. She’s just jealous of us, after  all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not anything so simple. Jealousy does come into it,  though.” Amane sighed. “I should apologise to you. This is something  that has troubled you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Though  the fault still lies with her…” Amane closed her eyes for a moment,  then opened them, glancing at her briefly. “Asayo is a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Asayo? You mean Koike?” Momomi frowned. “How is she a problem? You dealt with her well last time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  more specifically, my problem.” Amane rubbed her forehead, sighing  tiredly. “This isn’t something I should tell you about, if you didn’t  know already. That was something I agreed on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, jeez. Stop  being so bloody evasive. If you don’t, I’ll just get Kaname to  intimidate Koike until we get the full story. She owes me that much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I won’t tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it is troublesome. And tiring, for that matter.” Amane leaned against  the stall, staring at Starbright. “But Asayo should be more reasonable,  for now. She isn’t a bad person. She just lets her passion run away  with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that all?” Momomi demanded. “She was insulting me  for half an hour straight while we were working together there! And she  didn’t treat you any more gently, either. That isn’t what I’d call a  good person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. Well, you probably aren’t a good person either. By all accounts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you defending her so much, anyway? Do you two know each other?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane nodded briefly. “That’s correct. Though we’ve drifted apart in recent times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, trying to get her head around the concept of Amane knowing someone else. “Is that right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see… so she’s just jealous of me, right?” Momomi shook her head. “If  that’s the case, there’s no problem. Just tell her to stop, if you’re  the one she wants to please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. I did that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why are you sulking? What did she say to you, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked at her briefly. “It’s nothing important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  hell it is! You didn’t turn up for breakfast and now you’re sulking!”  Momomi folded her arms, fuming. “That’s easily important enough to tell  me, so get on with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It has nothing to do with you.” Amane looked away, frowning. “That’s all there is to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her for a moment, eyes narrowed. “Oh? Is that right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That is correct. For your part, she’ll treat you better. That’s the only thing that matters to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  kind of attitude is that? You have problems as well, you know, and if  you think you can deal with them by being cool and alone you’re being  an idiot. It’s pretty damn obvious she’s upset you somehow, so spill  it, already!” Momomi glared at Amane, who looked back with blank  crimson eyes. “I’m worried about you as well, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged. “I didn’t ask for that, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  gritted her teeth. “Well, worry is something you receive, whether you  ask for it or not. Get used to that!” She took hold of Sol’s reigns.  “I’m taking her out. See you later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi walked  her horse out into the light; face locked in a deep scowl as her eyes  swept over the people watching her. A moment later, she mounted and  began to ride. Amane remained in the shadows of the stables.</span></p>
