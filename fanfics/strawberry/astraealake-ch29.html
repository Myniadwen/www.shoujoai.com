<p>“Well, please  make yourselves comfortable. I’ll be back in a second.” Serané walked  over to her wardrobe and opened it, sliding an assortment of casual  clothes and coats to one side and taking out some large canvases. </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You keep your art in there?” Momomi asked, raising her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Some of it. It has to go somewhere, and I don’t want it in the way. Besides, I don’t want it where it can be seen too easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I see…” Momomi took the chance to inspect her wardrobe, as well. <em>Somehow,  I find it impossible to imagine Serané in casual clothes, but it looks  like she has some anyway. Of course, they’re modest and elegant, all  the same. This is her, after all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané passed out the first picture. “Here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo  took it and sat down, balancing it on his knees before placing it on  the table. “That’s amazing,” he said. “I’m completely embarrassed by  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re completely embarrassing me. I’m not that good, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  stared at the picture. It showed the front of the Strawberry Dorms,  perfectly captured with delicate pastel shades. Every detail had been  captured, the windows, the soft creamy stone, the vines on the walls,  the grass and the trees and the stone pathway leading straight forwards  beneath a warm, bright sky. <em>The only thing missing is the people.  As something of an artist myself, I have to admit, this is truly  exquisite. I’m damned if I’m telling her that, though. </em>“It’s very beautiful. How long did this take you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A long time, I’m not sure exactly. I did that one in fourth year, when I didn’t have the duties of Etoile.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  your modesty aside, this is incredible. You’re wonderful with detail.  And you leave this in the back of a wardrobe!” Araldo sounded almost  accusing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You do me too much credit… I picked an easy subject,  so I can’t be very proud of that picture. There are others.” Serané  passed out several more full-colour paintings, the greenhouse’s  interior, the lonely elm in the middle of the forest clearing, light  reflecting off Astraea’s lake, the Church. Each was beautiful, complex  and seemingly complete.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re a master of landscapes,” Momomi admitted, despite herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of  landscapes, yes. But I’m very bad with people. That’s why this is my  favourite, even though it’s not as good as I wish and feel it could  be.” Serané pulled out one more picture. This one was wrapped in a  protective cloth, which she unfolded and placed gently aside. Finally,  she handed it to Araldo.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">It was a picture of Kariya, sitting on a  chair, with her arms folded in her lap, staring boldly at the viewer as  if daring them to laugh. The interior of their room was fully realised  around her, but she was emphasised most of all, dressed in all the  finery of her Miator uniform, down to the crinkles in her green necktie  and the slight folds in her gloves. Her eyes blazed with passion and  energy, a force that ran through her despite her demure clothes and  posture. Her red hair was coiled tightly into her ponytail, falling  behind her head and catching the light. Everything, from the height to  the sharp, aquiline face to the shape of her body to the firm set of  her shoulders was captured, screaming Kariya. <em>It’s… a wonderful picture, </em>Momomi reflected. <em>Incredibly  true to life. I wonder how many hours she sat for this. I can accept  Serané being a patient, conscientious artist, but for Kariya to do the  same is incredible. To sacrifice yourself a little to accept another  person’s hobby, isn’t that part of love?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s wonderful.” Araldo stared at it, taking in every detail. “You’re truly very talented…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané sat opposite him. “I’m not, though. You’re too kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“False  modesty aside, I’m fairly strong at painting myself,” Araldo said. “But  you’re far beyond me. Like this, you could be a professional portrait  artist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Even if I have some talent, it’s not for that. Like I  said, I’m weak with people.” Serané sighed. “I had to practise hard to  improve to a decent level when I was working on this. That’s why it’s  my treasure, because it represents the most of my effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo nodded. “So you went this far… for Kariya?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  shouldn’t think so… she wasn’t a willing sitter, she merely tolerated  it.” Serané smiled. “She certainly wouldn’t request something like  this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s not what I meant. When you paint, you paint something beautiful that you want to capture, am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You make it sound so dramatic, but I suppose you are right. I just draw pretty things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps  you’re different,” Araldo said. “But that’s how it is for me. When I’m  compelled to capture a beautiful thing, I draw and paint. She’s very  beautiful, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané nodded solemnly. “Absolutely so.  That’s why I painted this, you’re right. And it does frustrate  especially, because I’m still doing her injustice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think any portrait of her could be good enough for you,” Araldo said quietly. “Am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  think so. I can capture every one of her qualities, if I work my  hardest and try my best, but I can’t capture life.” Serané glanced at  him. “You know, that’s why I want to be with her always. Nothing can  compare to her presence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo stared at the portrait to avoid making eye contact. “I think I understand…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi rolled her eyes then returned her attention to the wardrobe. “There’s another canvas in there, isn’t there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  not showing you that, Momomi-chan, so don’t get too excited. There are  some pictures that are best left hidden. But I’ll get out my  sketchbooks, as well. Perhaps you’ll have a more realistic perspective  of my abilities when you see the hard work required to obtain those  finished products.” Serané stood and rummaged through again, coming  back with six assorted sketchbooks. “Here. Feel free to look through  them as you like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi picked up one at random and flicked  through it to see various scenes from nature, large and small. It  rather reminded her of her own preoccupation with garden scenes, but as  expected, Serané’s loosest doodles were still far more impressive than  many of her half-serious attempts. <em>Well, she has quite an age advantage. I’ll catch up with her in the fullness of time. </em>She glanced sidelong at the wardrobe, and saw that several sketchbooks had been left in there as well. <em>I  wonder what’s in there… sketches so bad she’s embarrassed to show them?  Of course, because this is Serané, they’re probably still amazing.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Impressive as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  looked up and saw with wry amusement that he’d picked up a sketchbook  dedicated to people. Well, there were some other people, but Kariya  definitely appeared to command a majority of appearances. “Still  drawing beautiful things, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“My, my… when Momomi-chan says it, it sounds so dreadfully sarcastic.” Serané smiled sweetly. “She’s right, all the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So pencils and paint is your materials?” Araldo asked, still flicking through the book. “You have a very traditional style.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané  nodded. “I’m not comfortable with more modern methods. Even if it’s  more difficult in some ways, I prefer doing things like this. Perhaps  I’m just reactionary, but it’s a comforting thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, I agree  completely. Art doesn’t have to rush ahead and change, in my opinion.  To be so wonderful with traditional methods, that shows a lot of  dedication and skill.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Keen, aren’t you?” Momomi teased. “Do you want to be her art student, cousin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo closed the sketchbook with a snap. “Serané-san, do you mind if I touch on a personal matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané gave him an odd glance. “Please, feel free.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why are you always lying to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sorry? Lying to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo  rolled his eyes. “Don’t screw with me, I’m not blind. You’re talking to  me now like I’m a real person, but before, you’re always just playing  with me. Me and my family alike, you just lie through your teeth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you noticed,” Serané said lightly. “But don’t expect an apology for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why  that? What did I do to deserve that?” Araldo snorted. “Do you really  hate me that much? Is it some kind of punishment? Or have I just been  typecast and screwed over because of the marriage thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’s nothing personal, I’d have done this to any suitor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Look,  I know you hate the idea of marrying me. I get that already. No, it’s  true to say that you had no intention of going through with it from the  start. But couldn’t you have been honest with me? Wouldn’t that have  been the decent thing to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You say it is if it would be so  easy, and for you, it would,” Serané said. “But, you see, I was stupid  enough to be honest, and tell my parents why I can’t accept this  marriage or any other. They refuse to believe me, and you’re the same  anyway. When people can’t accept the truth I have to lie.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Truth  or not is beside the point,” Araldo said. “The only important truth is  that you don’t want to marry me, right? Just tell everyone that, and  it’s over. And you won’t screw with my feelings so much, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ironically  enough, I was trying to spare your feelings, like this,” Serané said.  “I thought that rather than rejecting you outright, I’d be able to make  you hate me and reject me yourself. I can’t say that’s worked, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  only works for as long as I let myself be fooled,” Araldo said. “But I  saw past it, and then I’m only even more offended. I still don’t get  it. It’s not like my feelings are the most important thing to you here,  we both know that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so. You’re right, it was  selfishness again. But if I just reject you, now my parents know my  reasons, I’ll be blamed. I’m very selfish, Araldo-kun. I don’t want to  lose anything. Is that so strange?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo sighed. “You love Kariya-san, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané blinked, appearing to consider this. “Of course. But in what way are you making that statement?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t mean the love of a friend or a sister or family member,” Araldo said. “Romantic love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right. That’s the sense of my love for Kari-chan.” Serané closed her eyes. “Can you accept that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Before,  I would have laughed. Momomi… I suppose she made me reconsider things,  just a little. At the very least, she proved that people can believe in  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané quirked her eyebrows. “I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But like I  said, I’m not blind or stupid. This is the true you, not the act you  put on… I noticed this before, but when you’re in this room you don’t  pretend. You’re yourself here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi put her sketchbook down, unheeded, and walked off, pottering about the shelves and looking at Serané’s manga collection.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then I suppose I do owe you an apology for misleading you. But you’re right. This is the real me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  it wasn’t too hard to discover the connection between the two of you.  You didn’t hide it, exactly. But you did hide yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The  hope was that you’d find me too flippant.” Serané smiled at him. “After  all, Kari-chan says I have a naturally charming personality, so I had  to be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I found the whole thing weird. I still  do.” Araldo looked at her. “But… it’s a lot of things, none of which  have anything to do with your acting. I don’t know quite how to  describe it, except to say that I’m not stupid. But once I’ve moved  past the fact that you’re both girls, I can tell.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  a nebulous thing… the way you look at each other, the way you stay  close to each other, the way you say each other’s names, nicknames, the  way you talk… even the pictures…” Araldo shrugged. “Even if I can’t  understand it, I can recognise it for what it is. Genuine emotion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m mildly impressed. I had expected you to be an implacable bigot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi moved on, looking at the pictures. They were, while never <em>totally </em>incriminating,  circumstantial evidence in themselves. She was sure that Serané kept a  photo album hidden somewhere, so she started to look for it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo  winced. “I can’t say I find it usual, or anything I’m comfortable with.  But I’m smart enough to know that if it’s important to you, my opinions  won’t matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané sighed softly. “Well, I suppose I’ll have  to settle for that. As you have probably worked out by now, I’m afraid  I don’t have any interest in you. Ideally, I want to shoot down all  such arrangements and spend my future with Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You might outgrow this, you know. It might not work out. And if that happens-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  that happens, I will still be able to live without regrets, knowing  that I followed my heart,” Serané said bluntly. “That may be a cliché,  but it’s still true. If I give Kariya up now, I will never be able to  forgive myself. I have thought of these things, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t know what the future holds, and I can’t guarantee that things  will be perfect between us forever. I know that life isn’t such an easy  thing. But… I’ve spent three years trying and I want to carry on like  that, I want to find the future together with her. Because I love  Kari-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>No sign of that album. Now, where’s it hiding? Do  I want to find it, I wonder? It might contain dirty pictures…that  doesn’t seem like Serané, but it just might be an interest of hers, all  the same. Oh, well. The wardrobe, perhaps?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo smiled weakly. “It really would have been easier for me if you’d said that on the first day, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so. But would you have believed me, or accepted those words? More to the point, what do you intend to do now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  wish I could be the person to save you from what you are,” Araldo said.  “But that’s not possible. You don’t want to be saved, and I don’t think  I’d be the one anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There’s nothing to be saved from, and  nothing to be ashamed of,” Serané said firmly. “And I’m not just saying  that for myself. As Etoile, I’m responsible for hundreds of young  students. If I couldn’t say that much, I would have no right to lead  them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo just nodded. “I understand… and I’ll tell my father  to cancel the whole thing. He’ll be furious, but I think I’m better  placed than you to state as much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s more than I had dared hope for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo  chuckled. “Don’t thank me, on so many levels. For one, it would take a  stronger man than me to marry someone who will hate me for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s a good point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Besides, I have this sense that your Kariya would kill me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  looked around the base of the wardrobe without finding any photo  albums. But her eyes did settle on the one full-scale picture that  Serané hadn’t shown off. <em>Is this one actually half-decent as  opposed to brilliant? Well, whatever. If she doesn’t want me to see it,  that’s reason enough.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané laughed. “You make her sound so vicious… she wouldn’t be so cruel.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, all that talk of kendo made me feel very weak, you know,” Araldo replied. “Forgive me for being intimidated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pulled it out and took off the dust cloth. “Aha- eh…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané  looked round and put a hand over her eyes. “My, my, Kiyashiki. It’s not  polite go through people’s stuff without their permission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, suffice to say I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo stood, leaning forwards. “Let me see!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  held it up, laughing when he blushed and looked away. “It’s artistic,  at least.” She rolled out of the wardrobe and balanced the picture on  her knees, looking down at it more carefully. This time, Kariya was in  bed, naked and swathed in white sheets. She faced away, looking  demurely over her shoulders with a softer expression than usual. Her  hair was untied and fell down her bare back in a crimson wave. But  there was something surprising, as well. “Tattoos,” she noted softly,  touching the picture.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Irezumi,” Serané corrected. “It’s a traditional Japanese method.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The tattoo covered most of her back, cast in bright colours against her white skin. <em>It’s  another chance to marvel at Serané’s attention to detail, but this is a  strange circumstance for it. Just how well does she know Kariya’s back?  No, don’t answer that…</em> “A dragon fighting a woman with a spear, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A  naginata,” Serané corrected. “It’s not finished and won’t be for  several years, even with Kariya making trips every weekend. She’s  skipping this week, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You mean she really has this on her back?” Momomi asked, startled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t have the artistic vision to make it up,” Serané said lightly. “So, yes. Surprised?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  opened her mouth to say something, then paused for a moment, thinking.  “I guess I really haven’t ever seen her outside that oh-so-proper  uniform.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course,” Serané teased. “That’s my prerogative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But why does she have something like that? She never struck me as the type…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a tradition of her family, and a proof of dedication to them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  a little like me, actually. She wants both her family and me. I hope  that’s not impossible.” Serané smiled. “All the same, I’d appreciate it  if you didn’t spread this around. It’s not necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi considered this. “Ah. Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Araldo  had overcome his shock, and was staring at the portrait with interest.  “It’s beautiful. I never thought I’d see Kariya-san looking so… gentle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t get too enthusiastic,” Serané said, cocking her head and looking at him with amused eyes. “She’s all mine, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You won’t let me forget that, will you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“She’ll attest, I’m a twitchingly jealous person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked at it again herself, moving her attention away from the tattoo and onto the face. <em>He  has a point. When she looks like that, it’s hard to describe, but  there’s a very soft warm feeling. It’s not something you’d expect to  see from the cold, hard Kariya. But I guess even she warms when she’s  like this…</em>Somewhere in her mind she wondered whether Kaname could  ever look the same way, and her mind was quickly flooded with  disturbingly lurid images. <em>Yeah, right, as if Kaname would ever  look so vulnerable. Its not like she’s very secure, but she wouldn’t  let down her barriers like that, not even for love. It’s frustrating,  in a way, she’s almost untouchable, not because she wants to be, but  because that’s the way she is…</em>Momomi sighed. <em>But I’m not kidding  anyone anyway. I’d love to see her look like this, if I’m honest with  myself, but it’s not going to happen. In the same way that it’s  impossible for Serané to fall for Araldo. I know all that, so I  shouldn’t indulge in lovesick thoughts. It’s just immature. Wait,  lovesick… ugh, do I want to go that far, even in my thoughts? For all I  know, this is what people dismiss with a superior smile as  “infatuation”. It’s all so unclear.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Somehow they got through  the morning, looking at Serané’s sketches and discussing drawing and a  hundred other things. Momomi was content to let the other two do most  of the talking, drifting off herself and wasting yet more time thinking  about things she’d analysed far too much, for far too long, before, and  still coming up with no answers but more uncomfortable questions. She  was getting used to that process. <em>I know that the best course is to  do nothing. So why do I keep brooding about this? Knowing the right  thing to do is useless if you can’t follow it with all your heart. But  if I feel this many doubts, does that mean it’s the wrong thing to do?  What are the alternatives, though…better doubts than regrets surely? </em>Momomi sighed, cutting herself off. <em>Enough. I’ve been through this too many times already. </em>But  she kept thinking in the same way anyway, and it annoyed her. Serané  and Araldo actually got on quite well, better than Momomi had ever seen  them before. <em>Which is slightly ironic, when I think about it. But I  guess they understand each other now. Because they both know and want  this to stop at “friendly acquaintance”, they can be comfortable with  each other. That much makes sense, and it’s a little unlike…no, screw  it. Not that again. </em>And they practised drawing portraits together,  Momomi sketching Serané idly and wondering whether she could persuade  Kaname to sit for her. But that reminded her of Serané’s sketches of  Kariya, and that annoyed her as well. <em>Does everything have to come back to this? For God’s sake…</em>She bit her lip and sighed, accustomed but not comfortable with the current cyclic rictus of her thoughts. <em>This  is going to drive me insane. Undoubtedly. At this rate, they’ll need me  to room in a padded place with a uniform so straight-laced you can’t  move your arms, for my own sake.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kiyashiki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes?”  Momomi asked absently, stopping by the door. Araldo had already gone to  see her father, and she wanted to see Kaname, so she gave the Etoile a  slightly impatient glare. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It appears that I owe  you some thanks,” Serané said. “It sounds that Araldo-kun… well,  perhaps acceptance is too strong a term, but he’s given up, which suits  me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When you say that, it sounds so harsh,” Momomi noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, Kariya’s always told me that love can be very vicious. It’s an exclusive, possessive kind of emotion. This is the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm? And does Serané think that, to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané  cocked her head, considering the question. “I suppose I do agree, all  in all. I’m disappointing a lot of people and hurting him, like this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi snorted. “But not, I think, as much as if you went ahead with the marriage anyway, feeling as you do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re probably right. But the other thing is, are you fine, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What? Why wouldn’t I be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  seemed a little distant there,” Serané said. “And you weren’t as  talkative as you usually are. I was wondering whether you had something  on your mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, of course I do,” Momomi replied. “I mean, I  have two days to perform the miracle of gaining my father’s consent to  stay at this dump. That’s pretty damned stressful in itself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  suppose it is,” Serané said. “Just remember, Kiyashiki-san, if you ever  want to just talk things over, feel free to come to me. I won’t laugh  at you or tell anyone else, and I’m always ready to listen.” She  smiled. “You may not credit it, but I may even have good advice for  you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You say confidential, but you’d tell Kariya anyway,” Momomi pointed out. “She’s not so kind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  suppose I would, but you’re probably going to tell everything to  Kenjou-san, right?” Serané looked amused. “That’s the way it goes, and  I’m glad of it. It’s important that you can talk to her, if not me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. Good luck, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t need it.” Momomi opened the door again, and was almost run over by the red-haired tempest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m back,” Kariya said abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Welcome back. How was it? You look a little vexed, Kari-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Let’s just say that if I had my blade to hand, we wouldn’t have anything but red roses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, my. That bad?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah. The master and I had a little heart-to-heart… I can’t say I enjoyed it, but it did make things clear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re as direct as ever, Kariya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This way gets results.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, I had a little talk with Araldo-kun. It appears that he  understands things, and is going to cancel the arrangement.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Really?  You mean he’s not another fricking homophobe? God, it pisses me off  that we’re forced to even admit that kind of person to our school…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They’re  people, too, Kari-chan, even if they don’t like us. But it’s not that  he’s not against that, as far as I can tell, he just knows that he  won’t be able to change anything. I guess I’m grateful for even this  little understanding.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So it’s settled?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s settled, I think, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thank God… keeping my temper in check was getting to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Serané  laughed at the abrupt change in tone. Well, it was more of a giggle.  “I’m sure, Kari-chan. Sit down, though. You look exhausted, I’ll get  you some tea…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pushed herself off the wall outside their  room and walked away, deciding that they probably deserved to be alone.  But it annoyed her, for some reason, when they sounded like that. Now  she was feeling even more grumpy for lunch. She walked through the  corridors, resenting the happy faces of the students she passed, their  idle chatter and casual elegance and complete ignorance of the real  world. It was also so annoying. <em>I guess part of what I said really  was true…this is pushing me to the breaking point, and fraying my  nerves to little pieces. School, homework, the literature club, the  Church, Kaname and most importantly my parents, it’s far too much, too  fast, for me to cope. So now I’m just generally pissed off at  everything, and most of all at myself. It’s not exactly enjoyable to  feel this rotten and twisted.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, you finally arrived.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not my fault Serané held me back with her damnfool advice,” Momomi snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ooh,” Kaname said sarcastically. “Very scary. I’d better run for cover.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Shut  up and queue.” Momomi sighed, trying to check her temper. “What  happened your end, anyway? Kariya was hacked off about something…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  laughed. “Her and your father got into a row. Well, it wasn’t shouting,  really, more cold anger. I’m impressed. Your dad can face off against  her like that without flinching. I’m sure most grown men would burst  into tears or run in terror after a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I guess that does explain a lot,” Momomi said. “Where are they all, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They’re  eating in their room today,” Kaname said. “The old man wasn’t best  pleased when Kariya contradicted him. Actually, that’s another thing he  said, all about how he’s going to complain to everyone from the  Superior to her father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed at the thought. “Good  luck to him with that, because he really will need it. Was there  anything else? I guess you can tell me the details later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nothing  in particular… I had another little chat with your sister.” Kaname  folded her arms. “I’m not quite sure whether I like her or hate her,  but I’m sure it’s one of those two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled. “Knowing  you, probably both. You’re not very secure with any positive feelings  that aren’t counter-balanced by some negatives.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nah, that just goes for you, who alternates being interesting and annoying so freely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So I’m unique to you, is it? I’m very flattered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  uniquely annoying, more or less. Stringing me along with your  interesting aspects is just a way to ensure the net annoyance is higher  than if you completely drove me away in one, as far as I can tell.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  considered this. “Hmm… I could live with that. I’m sure you could make  a case for every relationship being like that, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In that case, you aren’t unique, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, even then, I’m still pretty sure that there’s only one of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A someone who makes being annoying a sublime art form.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  that’s the case, I’m the same as you, your soulmate,” Momomi teased.  “Because I learn from the best, which is you. At least I go out of my  way to play with you, but you can irk me just by being your grumpy old  self.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Pah. You’re as cheeky as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you’re still a grumpy man.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So, where are we gonna eat?” Kaname asked, picking up her bento. “The elm again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m a little tired,” Momomi said. “How about our room?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Our room? You know, we’re in there far more than is good for us as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know, but just this once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright. I’ll go along with you before you try and look cute and persuasive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“As if I’d do that for you.” Momomi smiled and grabbed her arm. “Come on, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright, no need to drag me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>I enjoy this far too much. </em>“I’ve no time for your drowsy, lethargic walk today.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“At least I know where I’m going when I walk. Anyway, what happened with you three? Did you enjoy yourselves?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi explained her side of things briefly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “You know, it sounds like Araldo might have a chance after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Say what? You know, even if I haven’t made it clear, Serané completely shot him down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No, what I meant is that he has no balls after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi laughed. “That’s just typical of you and your vulgar way of thinking… what would you have done?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  not sure,” Kaname said. “Well, I think I’d have read the writing on the  wall and accepted it sooner. But with more style than that, certainly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. And if you were my father?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’d  have discovered whether a sixth-Dan kendo practitioner is any good  without a sword.” Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets. “That’s better  odds than trying to grind her down with cold anger. It’s like in all  those fantasy games where you attack something with its own aspect… you  just won’t beat her that way, she feeds off of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess I know what you mean, but no one told him that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, he should have done more research. He doesn’t know enough about the Etoiles… I mean, he didn’t know about <em>them </em>at all. And everyone here knows. It’s hardly a secret.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess we are better organised, at the end of the day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  pushed open the door and sat on her bed, turning in time to watch  Kaname’s trademark slumping descent. “Are you actually going to eat  like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course,” Kaname said, opening her bento. “A  foreigner like you wouldn’t understand, but for a native like me eating  while lying down is simple.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smirked. “Is that why you just dropped rice everywhere?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m warming up, that’s all,” Kaname said defensively, chasing up the lost food. “Give me a little time, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  started on her own lunch, sitting in a more normal position. “But,  what’s with the tattoos? You know anything about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm? Oh, that, I remember… describe them to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I didn’t see it in person, just Serané’s drawing,” Momomi said. “But it  was this really big thing on her back. A woman in a kimono was standing  on a rock, using a spear- Serané said naginata- to ward off this big  serpent-like dragon thing twisting around her. It was very big and  bright and multicoloured. Serané said it was incomplete, and it’d take  years… she called it irezumi, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah. I see.” Kaname closed her eyes. “Well, even now, a proper tattoo of that kind has criminal connotations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But why would Kariya-sama have something like that, of all things?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  sighed, opening her eyes again and glancing impatiently at her friend.  “What I was trying to imply is that she’s probably yakuza.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That  would make her the daughter of an Oyabun, in charge of Kariya’s group.  That doesn’t sound too surprising to me. The tattoo would be part of  that. I’ve seen plenty of similar ones myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t sound so casual! You mean Kariya’s a gangster?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s only a theory,” Kaname said warningly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it would be easy enough to find out, surely?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname just shook her head. “No point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She glared. “Well, what does it matter? If she is, or if she isn’t? She’s Kariya-sama, that’s all that matters, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right, I guess,” Momomi said. “It’s interesting, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I’m the same. Maybe my father didn’t own half a city but he was yakuza  too, albeit the lowest kind. But I could care less. I’m not going to be  defined by my parents.” Kaname swallowed some more rice, chewing  philosophically. “If she’s having the tattoo done, she wants to be  taken seriously. But she has Serané as well. Those two really do try  and have everything in life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a pretty admirable attitude,” Momomi said. “Somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  how we live too, so it can’t be great. Take everything, spare nothing.”  Kaname picked up a piece of egg and ate it. “But it doesn’t matter  where you came from, if you live like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right. When I look at it, it’s not like my background’s any better.” Momomi sighed. “Messed up people, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  yeah. But we don’t have to be like this. That’s just our choice.”  Kaname laughed suddenly. “Actually, it would be pretty funny if I’m  completely wrong, and she just likes traditional tattoos. I doubt we’ll  ever know for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right.” Momomi stood and walked over  to Kaname, sitting on her bed. “Now sit up and eat properly. I have a  lot of dreaded fish that I can’t face, so I need you to get rid of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright, alright. All your damn orders…” Kaname sat up, yawning hugely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi took the chance to pop food into her mouth. “Got you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s cheating,” Kaname spluttered, coming close to choking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah. But I don’t have to be like this. This is just my choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Forget umeboshi, girl, I’m going to make you eat your words!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ohh, scary Kaname,” Momomi teased, smiling. <em>It’s a little annoying, how fast she cheers me up. But that’s also just the way it is. I can live with it.</em></span></p>
