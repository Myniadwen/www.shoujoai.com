<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>&quot;Une tasse de th&eacute; rouge, s&#39;il vous plait&quot; Nagisa asked, nodding politely 
as the pretty waitress acknowledged her order and scooted off into the 
cafe to prepare it.

Predictably, Emmie had chosen the only French speaking outlet in the 
entire city, making sure her student wouldn&#39;t even get a cup of tea 
without first practising the language to be able to order it, and Nagisa 
grimaced as she took her seat outside, realising she had a good twenty 
minutes alone before Emmie was due to join her.

A cunning ploy indeed.

Shuffling her grey coat out from under her as she made herself 
comfortable at the white plastic table, the red head looked woefully at 
the cafe&#39;s menu, the entire thing printed in French, lacking any 
Japanese or English as a guide. She might try ordering some food, but 
given the horrendous descriptions she&#39;d had of European delicacies such 
as buttered snails and boiled frog&#39;s legs, she feared for what she might 
end up having served to her.

Yes, a very cunning ploy indeed. Learn French or vomit as a consequence. 
It was no wonder Shizuma loved Emmie so dearly; they had the same 
vindictive streak.

Returning the menu card to its holder, Nagisa looked around her 
surroundings instead, taking in the busy town street the caf&eacute; was 
located on. Heading straight into the centre of the retail district, the 
wide road beside her heaved with Christmas traffic, the path full of 
people hurrying past on their way to do more holiday shopping. Amongst 
the noise and bustle of the crowd, Nagisa found the caf&eacute; exterior a 
stark contrast; an oasis of calm, the well pruned bushes and potted 
plants that marked it&#39;s border standing guard, protecting the occupants 
from the sprawling urban monster rumbling by.

It was cold outside, but the language barrier and the hesitation it 
generated had stopped Nagisa from sitting inside, worried that someone 
might approach her as she sat alone waiting for Emmie. As she&#39;d neared 
the building she&#39;d spotted a group of young european men inside the 
caf&eacute;, the lads loud and rowdy as they joked about at their tables, 
commenting on the particularly eye-catching figure of the waitress as 
she served them. With her lack of confidence, Nagisa struggled to tell 
the boys to go away at the best of times, let alone in a foreign 
language.

For a brief moment she smiled, wistfully bemused by the idea of 
rejecting a boy in favour of another girl, when only a few years ago 
she&#39;d have done anything to have a guy look at her the same way her 
beautiful fianc&eacute;e did.

Coming to Miator had changed Nagisa so much; she wondered if her parents 
would even recognise her when they returned from Europe after the 
holiday to visit.

Spring held so much to look forward to, yet was so painfully far away at 
the same time. So much would change with the start of the New Year; 
Miyuki would leave Astrea, Shizuma would get her flat and potentially 
Nagisa would move in with her, Tamao would be out of their way and the 
constant attentions from the younger years would lessen as Nagisa became 
a single entity in the eyes of Astrea, her silver haired girlfriend and 
their relationship safely removed from public scrutiny.

Long evenings curled up with a film, lazy mornings when the girls would 
have nothing better to do than bicker over who got dressed enough to 
make the tea.

Come spring, it would all be so much easier.

Yet spring was at least four more days of torture away, plus the term 
ahead of the exams when the girls returned from the winter break. It was 
like an insurmountable wall that drew a dark shroud across her mind, 
blocking the relief and freedom promised to her later if she&#39;d just 
manage to cope with the remaining wait.

Just a little longer, she kept telling herself, but all too often she 
found it too much, each barrage of emotional blackmail and social 
positioning from Miyuki stripping her soul away that little bit more.

Nagisa sighed, realising she was sinking back into a stupor of 
negativity once again. Today was supposed to be a break from the 
politics of Astrea, so why drag them here with her?

Determination setting on her pretty face, the young red head nodded to 
herself as she decided with executive conviction that today would be a 
happy day.

And as an icy breeze whipped across the caf&eacute; patio, the waitress 
reappeared, a steaming cup of red tea present on the tray she carried, a 
chorus of whistles following her backside as she walked past the young 
men inside.

The young woman rolled her dark eyes as she placed Nagisa&#39;s order on the 
table, the redhead sighing sympathetically. She understood the 
sentiment, the young woman before her stunningly attractive in an 
oriental sense, all soft smooth skin and long straight hair, but Nagisa 
found herself repulsed by the manner in which the group were vocalising 
the matter.

What did she see in guys for all those years?

The waitress smiled pleasantly and returned to her business, leaving 
Nagisa to warm her chill fingers on the outside of the china cup. 
Pausing a moment to feel the wonderful glow as her digits adjusted to 
the temperature, she then set about sweetening the drink slightly, 
stirring a level heap of sugar in.

As the teaspoon rang melodically against the porcelain rim, Nagisa was 
pulled from her thoughts by a heavily accented call from the street 
behind her,

&quot;Nagisa Aoi!&quot;

The red head beamed, recognizing the soft voice straight away, standing 
and turning as Emmie entered the caf&eacute; patio through a white metal 
archway within the managed floral border.

The French woman looked radiant as ever, her long brown hair loose, her 
slender figure hugged by a warm woollen wrap and a continental styled 
skirt. Soft brown boots covered her shins, the rest of her legs clad in 
expensively patterned hosiery that complimented her richly tanned skin.

&quot;Emmie-sama!&quot; she grinned, and reached out to hug the woman dearly, the 
pair greeting each other with a traditional theatric kiss to each cheek.

Holding each other at arm&#39;s length for a moment, Emmie smiled at the 
young woman before her,

&quot;You look amazing as ever Nagisa, I hope you&#39;re well?&quot;

Nagisa blushed as she mumbled her thanks, replying in a small voice,

&quot;Very much so, thank you Emmie-sama. But I shouldn&#39;t be the one 
receiving the compliments.&quot;

Emmie smiled, and bid the fourth year retake her seat as she drew the 
opposite chair from beneath the table Nagisa had chosen, setting about 
making herself comfortable.

Placing her car keys on the table and exclusive looking bag beside her 
feet, the French woman sat back in her chair, continuing to smile at the 
pleasant reunion.

For a moment, they sat in silence, Nagisa unsure of what to say, glad 
for the familiar face but realising she knew so little about her 
companion, she wouldn&#39;t know what to say to her to start the 
conversation.

Emmie relieved the awkwardness for her, beginning,

&quot;Mina wanted me to pass on her best wishes; you&#39;ve been sorely missed 
this past fortnight. She&#39;s determined to have you both back again for 
dinner as soon as she&#39;s finished with the holiday PR schedule.&quot;

Leaning back in her chair, she motioned abruptly toward the waitress. 
Turning back, the French woman continued,

&quot;We were thinking perhaps you might join us for Christmas dinner? Unless 
you both wanted some privacy for the day?&quot;

Nagisa felt her face flush again, and gestured her thanks quietly,

&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;d both love to. It&#39;s not yourself or Mrs Hanazono- &quot;

Emmie cut in, stressing the familiarity,

&quot;Mina Nagisa, her name is Mina.&quot;

And Nagisa blushed, correcting herself,

&quot;It&#39;s not you or Mina-sama we&#39;re trying to get away from by going to the 
Summer House. I&#39;m sure Christmas dinner would be lovely.&quot;

Smiling contently, Emmie cupped her hands on the table before her in 
satisfaction.

&quot;We&#39;ll make that a date then. Mina cooks a delicious Christmas Turkey,&quot; 
she added.

The waitress reappeared, and Emmie took the menu card from its stand as 
she greeted the young woman. Taking a moment to scan the list before 
her, she rattled off a brief list to the girl, nodding politely after as 
she completed the order.

Smiling, the waitress turned on heel, heading back to navigate the over 
excited young men in the restaurant.

Nagisa sighed at the ease at which the French woman manipulated the 
language, and Emmie caught the sentiment, frowning at her companion&#39;s 
frustration.

&quot;Shizuma tells me you&#39;ve not been learning French long? Did you study it 
at all before Astrea?&quot;

The fourth year shrugged in defeat, her demeanour shifting,

&quot;Not for long, and I wasn&#39;t very good at it then either.&quot;

Emmie nodded to the red heads half empty cup,

&quot;You got that far okay?&quot;

Nagisa twisted her hands together, resting the side of her head against 
them, muttering in avoidance,

&quot;I&#39;d have starved if you weren&#39;t here with me though,&quot; having recognized 
the plural reference to cake that Emmie has used during her order.

She sighed heavily,

&quot;It&#39;s just taking me a long time to catch up, and the other girls are so 
far ahead. And now I have all these extra duties on top to cope with as 
well.&quot;

The fourth year sighed at the subject, then more calmly added,

&quot;I&#39;m not coping too well with Etoile.&quot;

Emmie reached a hand forward sympathetically and smiled fondly,

&quot;In all fairness Nagisa, neither did Shizuma at first. By all accounts, 
she found it all extremely overwhelming after Kaori passed away.&quot;

Nagisa found the name strangely irritating today, her mood souring as 
she replied,

&quot;I don&#39;t have that excuse though. The only thing in my life that needs 
grieving is my free time.&quot;

Emmie tipped her head, surprised by the degree of Nagisa&#39;s mood swing. 
Shizuma hadn&#39;t been understating the extent to which things were getting 
on top of her girlfriend.

Catching herself, Nagisa apologised quickly,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Emmie-sama; that was wrong of me. It&#39;s all a bit much at the 
moment I guess.&quot;

The French woman smiled fondly and squeezed Nagisa&#39;s forearm.

&quot;You don&#39;t need to apologise Nagisa, we all have days like that. 
Besides, what else is family for?&quot;

Nagisa&#39;s expression softened at the word, and her face flushed again. 
She hadn&#39;t thought in those terms before.

&quot;Th-thank you,&quot; she stammered.

Emmie smiled, and gripped Nagisa&#39;s hand again briefly before sitting 
back more formally. Taking a more serious tone, she explained,

&quot;Shizuma was under the impression from tutoring you in summer that 
confidence is your main problem, and most of that came from you not 
having had enough time or the right environment to practice in?&quot;

She gestured for clarity,

&quot;It&#39;s one thing talking French to another student, but using French 
amongst native speakers is the fastest way of learning it properly.&quot;

Seeing Nagisa&#39;s face plummet rapidly into a pensive expression, Emmie 
grinned playfully,

&quot;You know, not all Europeans smell you know.&quot;

Nagisa blushed, realising her apprehension was so transparent. Hurriedly 
trying to explain for fear of causing offence, she gushed,

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that; certainly Emmie-sama could never smell 
badly. I just-&quot;

Emmie cut her off with a wave of her hand as she laughed musically, her 
eyes beaming her amusement,

&quot;I know Nagisa, I know.&quot;

Still shaking with the occasional chuckle, the brunette considered her 
next sentence. With a reassuring tone she continued,

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t bring you here to subject you to the unwanted 
attentions of those foreign students,&quot; and she gestured towards the 
group in the caf&eacute; who were preparing to leave,

&quot;I meant more with someone like myself that you could relax with. Trying 
to talk to people that intimidate you is going to be no different that 
trying to speak in front of the other girls in class who have been 
learning much longer than you.&quot;

Smiling fondly, she added,

&quot;I&#39;d like to think I don&#39;t intimidate you Nagisa?&quot;

The fourth year&#39;s face returned to its happy state, the new Etoile 
replying,

&quot;Of course not Emmie-sama, you&#39;ve been wonderful to me.&quot;

Then adding quickly, she said,

&quot;You both have.&quot;

The pair smiled across the table, Nagisa&#39;s mood recovered expertly by 
the European woman&#39;s humour and warmth.

But as Emmie greeted the returning waitress who brought with her a pot 
of tea and a selection of patisserie deserts, the attractive brunette 
pondered the young woman before her. Shizuma was right, Nagisa was very 
definitely not the same young lady she&#39;d been a fortnight before.

Emmie motioned the fourth year towards the refreshments,

&quot;Dig in, and perhaps we&#39;ll start with some basic stuff like verbs and 
sentence structure before getting technical?&quot;

And despite the red head doing her best to remain positive, Emmie 
noticed the crack in Nagisa&#39;s smile almost as soon as the new Etoile 
dipped her eyes towards the plate.

- - - - -

&quot;Rokujo-san?&quot;

Chikaru&#39;s soft voice echoed across the heavy wooden table in the student 
council chamber, the room&#39;s vacancy amplifying the fifth year&#39;s calm 
voice even further.

It was dark in the meeting room, the Miatorian President sat on the edge 
of an arm chair near the heavy red curtains that hung before each 
window, the young woman bent intently over a chaotic looking coffee 
table that lay strewn with documents and paperwork, lit by a single 
table lamp that perched amongst the mess.

Chikaru smiled wryly at the sight, the scene looking very much like her 
own room.

Approaching her Miatorian peer, the Lulim girl offered,

&quot;If it&#39;s any consolation, my Dormitory desk looks a lot like that too.&quot;

She twisted her face in exasperation, adding,

&quot;We&#39;ve cut it a bit close this year haven&#39;t we?&quot;

Miyuki, who had obviously pulled an all-nighter given the still shrouded 
windows, looked up from the collage of sheets, curling her black bob 
back behind one ear as it fell, her expression that of fatigue mixed 
with happy appreciation for having a sympathetic and understanding ear.

&quot;Yes we have, haven&#39;t we,&quot; she agreed, before relaxing back into her 
chair, her neck muscles complaining as she shifted position.

Glad for the interruption, she enjoyed the moment&#39;s rest, inquiring,

&quot;What can I do for you Chikaru-san? I hope you&#39;re well?&quot;

The Lulim girl nodded, her red ribbons mirroring the movement,

&quot;As well as can be expected at this time of year, thank you. I&#39;m almost 
done with the Lulim discharge, so if there&#39;s anything more I can do to 
help yourselves or Spica, please don&#39;t be afraid to ask.&quot;

Miyuki, head sinking pleasantly into the plush head rest of the 
high-backed arm chair, smiled in respect for her peer,

&quot;How do you do it Chikaru? Always first to finish, always first to offer 
assistance...&quot;

The dark haired Miatorian gently rocked her head in bemusement,

&quot;You&#39;ll be sorely missed the year after next.&quot;

Chikaru dipped her gaze politely, replying,

&quot;A lot of it comes from having a very efficient personal assistant,&quot; she 
said, after which she chuckled warmly.

&quot;Kagome still ceases to amaze me.&quot;

Miyuki smiled briefly before her expression returned to a state of weary 
fatigue, and she looked across toward the bookshelves at the opposite 
end of the room, her gaze unfocused and drawn.

&quot;Dear Kagome. There&#39;s always one, and inevitably they end up being at 
Lulim.&quot;

Lost in a moment&#39;s thought, the sixth year sighed heavily before 
returning to her business face, sitting up correctly and regaining her 
composure.

&quot;So what can I do for you Minamoto-san?&quot; she asked.

Accepting that their moment of informality had passed, Chikaru replied 
with the proper decorum that their titles demanded,

&quot;I came to inform you that your dress is ready Miyuki-san. Please, feel 
free to collect it at your convenience.&quot;

Miyuki&#39;s face shifted, momentarily portraying something akin to 
satisfaction, although Chikaru couldn&#39;t catch it properly in the dim 
light of the table lamp. She might even have confused it for vindictive 
glee.

&quot;Excellent Chikaru-san. If it&#39;s acceptable, I&#39;d like to pop by later in 
the evening to collect it?&quot;

Chikaru nodded, and waited to see if Miyuki had anything further to add, 
the sixth year obviously thinking something over by her furrowed brow. 
But the Miatorian senior didn&#39;t elaborate, and the Lulim President took 
it as her cue to leave,

&quot;I&#39;ll be back in my room as soon as dinner is finished Rokujo-san. Feel 
free to join me at your convenience.&quot;

To which Miyuki nodded her thanks, gesturing her farewell before 
returning to the paperwork before her. And as Chikaru turned to leave 
the stifling darkness of the council chamber, she found herself 
wondering how someone could maintain such a guarded demeanour without 
cracking open with repressed emotion.

- - - - -

&quot;Oh for godsake!&quot; Nagisa exclaimed, her frustration really beginning to 
show.

Undeterred by the young woman&#39;s venting, Emmie pressed the subject 
harder, leaning closer so she could stress the error to her student more 
clearly.

Explaining the source of the grammatical mistake with a few swift marks 
of her pen, the French woman tipped her head, her expression the picture 
of patience as Nagisa&#39;s brown eyes flicked across the alterations.

Understanding dawning on her, the fourth year rolled her eyes and sighed 
apologetically.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Emmie-sama, I see now.&quot;

She buried her forehead in cupped hands and slowly rolled her head from 
side to side. She wanted to scream, but conceded she&#39;d advanced further 
in this one morning than she had in weeks.

Swallowing the lump of frustration-born emotion that nagged at her 
throat, she raised her gaze, taking a deep breath.

Making sure her tone was composed and polite, she offered,

&quot;Thank you so much Emmie-sama, this really is a huge help,&quot; and parsing 
her lips she added,

&quot;It&#39;s no wonder Shizuma is so good at this.&quot;

Emmie half smiled, but brushed the compliment aside, not wanting the 
distraction. Instead she reasserted,

&quot;See, you can do this Nagisa. It&#39;s just a matter of time and practice.&quot;

The fourth year sighed again, slumping back in her chair.

Emmie was right of course, but did the red head really want to be 
sacrificing more time with her fianc&eacute;e for this rubbish?

No, of course not, like she&#39;d ever use French outside the classroom 
anyway. The only French speaker she knew was sat in front of her and 
spoke better English than she did, let alone formal Japanese or written 
Kanji.

Distractedly, the fourth year glanced away from the table, watching the 
traffic pass by.

The pair sat in silence for a moment, Emmie agitated by Nagisa&#39;s 
avoidance, Nagisa tired of the subject and needing a break. Deciding 
she&#39;d gained a fair bit of ground, Emmie elected to let the moment stand 
and relaxed into her own chair, gesturing again for the waitress.

It had been a long, hard morning, and catching her own rattled frame of 
mind, the French woman realised now would be a sensible time to pause.

It&#39;d also been an extremely interesting insight into the young woman her 
girlfriend&#39;s daughter was so enraptured by. Nagisa had certainly changed 
a fair bit since their last meeting, and Emmie was genuinely concerned 
for the red head&#39;s well being, the weight of the Etoile having crushed 
the girl&#39;s spirit completely.

Surely there must be something more going on here than an over whelming 
school appointment? Hadn&#39;t Shizuma mentioned something about her 
former-roommate making a nuisance of herself?

Emmie opted for some cool down time, after which she decided it was time 
to do a little digging and offer Nagisa the chance to confide more 
completely.

As the waitress approached the table, Emmie turned to order more tea, 
the French woman stopping mid sentence as her attention was caught by 
something else.

Nagisa was laughing.

Emmie frowned, gesturing for a fresh tea pot as she turned quizzically 
to the fourth year.

Sat back in her chair, brown gaze miles away, the young red head was 
smiling to herself as she played with her crimson Etoile stone.

Waiting for a moment so Nagisa could enjoy whatever mental image it was 
that had shifted her mood so quickly, the French woman caught the sound 
of pop music blaring from one of the cars crawling past the caf&eacute; in the 
heavy late morning traffic.

Catching the older woman&#39;s gaze, Nagisa returned to the moment.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny? You were ready to explode a moment ago?&quot; Emmie asked 
with a curious smile.

Nagisa blushed a deep shade of burgundy, and turned away, hiding her 
eyes and shaking her head.

Bemused, the intrigued smile crept further from the corner of Emmie&#39;s 
lips, and the brunette gestured for explanation.

&quot;Nagisa?&quot;

The fourth year&#39;s embarrassment exploded, and she turned back, shaking 
her head and holding her hands as if to say she didn&#39;t know where to 
start.

Finally finding the words, she managed,

&quot;It&#39;s that song,&quot; prompting the French woman to strain to hear it 
better,

&quot;I&#39;ve heard it before Emmie-sama&quot; the fourth year added.

Emmie tipped her head, listening intently.

Recognition flared, and she pulled the name from the air just as the 
chorus kicked in,

&quot;Weapon of Choice?&quot; she asked.

Nagisa nodded, blushing even further. Not understanding the 
significance, but enjoying watching the young woman squirm, Emmie 
motioned for further explanation.

&quot;I um.&quot;

Nagisa rolled her eyes in total embarrassment.

&quot;God, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m telling you this,&quot; she said, framing her face 
with her hands again.

Taking a deep breath, she began,

&quot;I first heard this track when Shizuma took Amane, Hikari and myself to 
the Summer House after a shopping trip.&quot;

Sitting back she resigned to completing the tale regardless of the 
consequences,

&quot;That was the night we drank that bottle of champagne Mina mentioned at 
dinner.&quot;

She giggled as she remembered the evening scene by scene, from Shizuma&#39;s 
antics at the bar to Hikari forcing the scarecrow-esque Amane to dance, 
from joining Shizuma atop the coffee table to making love on the sofa in 
front of the fire later that evening, the warmth of the burning wood 
complimented by the alcohol coursing through her veins, stripping the 
fourth year of her youthful inhibitions.

Pushing that last image out of her mind given the company she kept, the 
red head continued her story,

&quot;Shizuma played this on the living room stereo when she decided it was 
time we all lightened up a bit. She was dancing on the coffee table at 
the time.&quot;

Emmie, whose grin had grown broader and broader as the depth of Nagisa&#39;s 
embarrassment had progressed, burst into laughter,

&quot;Table dancing?&quot; Emmie asked, adding with an exaggerated look, &quot;Perhaps 
it&#39;s time we had the staff check the Summer House over for wear and 
tear?&quot;

She grinned, adding casually,

&quot;You know, there was a time when that child couldn&#39;t dance to save her 
life.&quot;

Nagisa baulked, unable to believe the remark,

&quot;But she dances so well? God, that night at the Summer House. I&#39;d never 
seen someone...&quot; and the Miatorian&#39;s voice trailed off as embarrassment 
caught up with the memory of watching the sixth year&#39;s slender hips 
rotate with the beat, the Hanazono girl winding up and down on her 
perfect legs, emerald eyes sparkling with wicked mischief as they&#39;d 
watched Nagisa squirm in the cosy leather arm chair.

After a moment&#39;s awkward silence, Nagisa mumbled quietly,

&quot;So um, that was why I was laughing.&quot;

Then in an even smaller voice, she added,

&quot;I could never dance that well.&quot;

And it was then that something snapped within the French woman. Sitting 
bolt upright, she gestured across the table,

&quot;Right, that&#39;s enough of that young lady.&quot;

Nagisa panicked, caught off guard by the sudden change in tone and 
fearing she&#39;d upset her companion.

But there was a smile behind the determination in Emmie&#39;s soft brown 
eyes, and she gestured again at Nagisa,

&quot;Put your books away, we&#39;re done with French until after the weekend,&quot; 
and the red headed Etoile baulked in confusion,

&quot;But you said we were going to meet on saturday as well Emmie-sama?&quot; she 
asked, her small voice betraying how unsure she was of the European 
woman&#39;s reaction, her over sensitive insecurities kicking in once again.

Noting that very trait in Nagisa&#39;s behaviour, Emmie nodded resolutely,

&quot;And that we will, but I have something much more important in mind for 
saturday. French can wait until after the Ball.&quot;

And without any further explanation, Mina&#39;s lover set about packing her 
language guides and dictionary away, having decided it was time to do 
something about Nagisa&#39;s complete lack of self-esteem.

- - - - -

&quot;Nagisa-chan, where have you been!&quot; Tamao exclaimed, her expression a 
weird mix of frustration and relief rolled into one as her seemingly 
part time-roommate appeared in the Dormitory corridor before her.

Tamao had even considered calling the Sister, the evening meal 
approaching quickly and Nagisa nowhere to be seen. The dark haired 
Etoile had spent the entire morning treading water with her chin now 
steadily disappearing below sea level; things were at their most 
critical with the Christmas Ball preparations, each of the many small 
teams Miyuki had put together now needing constant guidance and support 
if the work were to be done in time, and amongst all of this, Nagisa had 
seemingly disappeared.

Frustration subsiding, Tamao&#39;s voice returned to its usual fond tones, 
the upperclassman approaching her fellow Etoile, making her way past the 
door to the Dormitory lounge that she&#39;d been heading towards in search 
of her partner. Reading Tamao&#39;s expression despite the dim light in the 
corridor, the red head cringed, knowing full well what was coming next,

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Nagisa-chan, I didn&#39;t mean to snap. I&#39;ve just been worried, 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

Nagisa sighed, evasive as the dark haired Miatorian took her by the 
wrists, gazing attentively into her friend&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You&#39;ve been off premises again?&quot; she asked.

Too weary to play the cat and mouse game, Nagisa replied quietly,

&quot;I&#39;m taking extra French classes Tamao-chan,&quot; she explained, and then to 
avoid further questioning she added,

&quot;Miyuki should have told you; I&#39;m sorry if Tamao-chan was worried.&quot;

Uncharacteristically responsive for the Nagisa she knew of late, Tamao 
stood surprised by the red head&#39;s apparent openness.

Smiling happily she squeezed her roommate&#39;s hands,

&quot;Well you&#39;re here now, that&#39;s all that matters.&quot;

She grinned,

&quot;Just in time for prayer too! Oh, and I saw your dress. It&#39;s beautiful!&quot; 
Tamao added, doing her best to maintain the positive atmosphere.

Nagisa hadn&#39;t spoken to her more in the past fortnight than she had just 
then, at least, not without having to do so in a formal capacity.

The red head sighed, knowing full well the anger the previous compliment 
had suddenly generated was sourced by Miyuki&#39;s Etoile meddling and not 
by Tamao herself. Once again unwilling to risk falling into the question 
and answer game with her companion, Nagisa simply closed the 
conversation with blanket acceptance.

&quot;Thank you. I hope it matches yours Tamao-chan.&quot;

The dark haired Etoile was about to press further when a swish of black 
fabric and the crisp ring of heels on the wooden floor announced Miyuki 
Rokujo&#39;s arrival.

&quot;Good evening Etoile-sama,&quot; the council President offered in a formal 
voice, her tone curt and clipped.

Tamao returned the greeting as required, but Nagisa blanked the woman 
altogether. After the long morning of tutorship and the confusing end to 
her time with Emmie, the red head really wasn&#39;t in the mood at all.

&quot;Are we ready to give the evening prayer?&quot; Miyuki asked, prompting 
Nagisa to scowl further.

Inwardly she wanted to snap back, pointing out they were as ready as 
they were every day of the week, fifty two weeks of the year, just as 
their duty required them to be.

And more importantly, that they didn&#39;t need asking or reminding after so 
much damn practice!

But once again, the fourth year bit her lip, knowing all too well the 
consequences of letting the outburst fly.

Tamao, noting the thunder cloud on Nagisa&#39;s face, answered quickly on 
behalf of the pair,

&quot;Yes we are Rokujo-san. Was there anything else you needed from us?&quot;

Miyuki, her aura cold and stoic, took a matter of fact tone and gestured 
to reinforce her next point,

&quot;Obviously, we&#39;re now a day away from the Ball.&quot;

She paused, gathering her words,

&quot;I thought I&#39;d take a moment to stress to the pair of you that, after 
tomorrow evening there will be absolutely nothing I can do to assist 
you.&quot;

She motioned in the vague direction of the Dormitory population,

&quot;Once discharge is complete, the Christmas Ball itself will be entirely 
in your hands. I&#39;ve done what I can for the preparations, but the actual 
event itself is in the realm of the Etoile. I hope you both understand 
the responsibility that will carry?&quot;

Nagisa, facing away, rolled brown her eyes, Tamao catching the gesture 
from the corner of her peripheral vision.

Surely Miyuki was baiting her room mate. Unless...

There was something odd about Miyuki&#39;s tone and Tamao was puzzled. If 
this wasn&#39;t to start a fight, which the sixth year&#39;s manner somehow 
suggested it wasn&#39;t, then why the need to stress the point so markedly?

The council President continued,

&quot;Once the morning meeting is complete and the girls have had their tasks 
allocated, the success of the event in its entirety will be down to you 
two. My attendance at the Ball will be purely that of my position and my 
social responsibility to maintain a presence.&quot;

Not really following Miyuki&#39;s point, but fully aware that Nagisa next to 
her was about to explode, Tamao filled the silence with the words that 
she presumed Miyuki would want to hear,

&quot;We understand our obligations Rokujo-san; we&#39;ll endeavour to fulfil 
them on Saturday just as we would any other day of the year,&quot; and then 
after a pause, she added, &quot;for the integrity of Miator of course.&quot;

Still utterly perplexed by the conversation, Tamao responded politely as 
Miyuki expressed her satisfaction,

&quot;I&#39;m glad that&#39;s clear. We should proceed with the evening prayer.&quot;

Tamao nodded her agreement, reaching back to touch Nagisa&#39;s arm, the red 
head shirking the interference in her personal space, despite being 
thankful for her dark haired companion&#39;s quick removal of Miyuki.

Watching the sixth year stride off down the corridor toward the dining 
hall, Tamao glanced between her room mate, who unceremoniously blanked 
all opportunity to thank her fellow Etoile, and the imposing form of the 
council President disappearing into the dim light ahead.

What was that about?

- - - - -

&quot;...after which, on this final Friday of the school year, the staff and 
I wish you all a very Happy New Year and look forward to seeing you 
fresh and rested in the spring!&quot;

Finishing her speech, Sister Mizue stepped back from the podium lectern 
and tapped her hands together softly in theatrical celebration.

A polite round of applause rippled through the Cathedral as the audience 
followed suit, until eventually, someone broke with convention and let 
their excitement bubble over, giggling as they cheered above the noise. 
Excitement abound, the gathered students followed one after another and 
it wasn&#39;t long before the cold stone walls erupted with applause as the 
girls realised they were once again free for the holiday.

Smiling faces and beaming eyes flashed amongst the crowd, and in her 
place stood beside the Dormitory administrator and her fellow Etoile, 
even Nagisa managed a weak smile as she watched her classmates hugs each 
other joyously, the congregation slowly beginning to file from the 
Cathedral entrance in methodical fashion.

Even from her vantage point atop the stage dais, she could feel the 
enthusiasm and elation coursing through the chamber.

That bit closer, Nagisa told herself, and for a moment, she could almost 
feel the weight falling from her shoulders. She&#39;d be away with Shizuma 
before she knew it, and the worst she&#39;d have to endure after that would 
be Mina and Emmie&#39;s inevitable teasing. She could finally do something 
about making up for her miserable term-time behaviour to Shizuma too.

But before she could slip too far into her plans, a dark shadow 
stretched across her view, announcing the presence of the Miatorian 
President.

Stood before the Head Sister, Miyuki bowed respectfully, adding a curt 
nod to the Etoile stood to one side. Her dark eyes showed heavy lines, 
the result of several nights missed sleep, the senior having pushed 
herself far beyond her usual limitations to complete her end of year 
duties; such was the disruption to the usual state of affairs this term 
and the degree to which Miyuki was determined not to fail.

&quot;The council is happy to confirm that it&#39;s end of term responsibilities 
are complete. The Dormitory girls will be free to leave as soon as 
tomorrow&#39;s Celebrations have finished.&quot;

Mizue nodded in satisfaction, patting Miyuki on the arm sympathetically.

&quot;It&#39;s never easy this time of year Rokujo-san, the council has done well 
to keep pace.&quot;

She smiled, looking back across the happy faces of the students before 
her,

&quot;Once again your skills have carried us through. Look at them Miyuki, 
you&#39;d hardly know anything had been different this year.&quot;

As the sixth year looked back across her shoulder, taking in the happy 
throng, the Sister returned to a more formal posture, her hands gathered 
before her.

&quot;You should all be very proud.&quot;

Miyuki nodded her thanks, gesturing to the Etoile stood listening 
quietly to the exchange,

&quot;We&#39;ve had a great pairing step into the gap left by Spica&#39;s mistakes 
Sister; they&#39;re due as much praise as the council is.&quot;

Her words were marked, her gaze falling on Nagisa directly, twisting the 
sentiment with an edge of sarcasm that others would have missed were 
they not been present at Miyuki&#39;s many sermons that she&#39;d forced the red 
head to endure. Tamao watched warily, unsure whether or not to expect 
trouble and protectively stepping to close the distance between her and 
Nagisa.

Mizue, oblivious to the exchange, added next,

&quot;Yes of course, our new Etoile,&quot; and she turned to congratulate the 
pair, Nagisa forcing a smile, but still acutely aware of Miyuki&#39;s dark 
eyes burning a hole in her.

Clapping her hands together with a satisfied smile, the Dormitory 
administrator gathered herself to leave,

&quot;Which only leaves the Ball! I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t need to inquire as to our 
state of readiness; you&#39;ve been more than methodical in your final year 
Miyuki, I&#39;ll happily leave the last of the arrangements in your hands 
and join the staff.&quot;

After which the old woman nodded her farewell, heading off stage left 
towards the dim corridors that led backstage and out via the rectory 
exit.

Nagisa let a quiet sigh slip, and gazed back across the milling sprawl 
of mixed uniforms and beaming faces.

One step closer.

Shuffling out amongst the hectic column of girls, Kaname Kenjo walked 
with the grim expression of someone carrying their biblical cross to 
crucifixion, the slope of her dark fringe hiding irritable eyes from her 
once girlfriend beside her.

The Spican pair had been forced to attend the end of term ceremony 
together for council appearances sake, although little had passed 
between them during the entire morning&#39;s proceedings, the space around 
them teeming with subtext and particularly on Momomi&#39;s part, unspoken 
and desperately pressing feelings.

The line was moving slowly away from the Cathedral, the sky outside 
clear but crisp, the snows and heavy winds of late having passed. 
Japan&#39;s winter was rarely heavy set or prolonged, and the beginnings of 
spring were almost tangible amongst the brilliant disc in the vaulted 
sapphire sky and the sniff of fresh salt in the sea air lingering on the 
breeze.

Kaname would be glad to see an end to the darkness and depressingly long 
nights, the sultry Spican more at home under the blistering sun on an 
open court, the opponent before her and the gazing eyes of the crowd 
more compelling than the atmospheric nights under deep clouds and broken 
light that accompanied the Christmas months. She might be a night owl, 
but not in the repressed gothic sense that so many of her fellow 
students seemed to be. Particularly those from Miator, she noted wryly.

Momomi beside her was silent, the brunette&#39;s pretty hair framing her 
face, hiding her own irritation as numerous underclassmen bumped into 
her as they rushed back to the Dormitories or their next, and mostly 
likely final class. Looking down at the over excited juniors, she sighed 
uncomfortably, triggering her tall companion to misread the subtext,

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry Momomi, one more day and you&#39;ll be shot of me for good,&quot; 
Kaname muttered in an offhand tone, her gaze far across the bay and out 
towards the sea beyond.

Momomi&#39;s eyes widened and she looked off to one side, her chest rising 
in exasperation and angry frustration.

She bit back a snarl and the rising tear that threatened to follow it, 
snorting in contempt for the comment and continuing to avoid eye contact 
with the tall fifth year beside her.

Kaname leered, leaning into the brunette&#39;s personal space as she pushed 
the point,

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Momomi? Not looking forward to a single room?&quot;

Dark lips curled in vindictive pleasure as she continued,

&quot;After all, surely you&#39;ll be glad to see the back of me? Such a flawed 
girlfriend, so much like damaged goods!&quot; and she gestured with a wide 
sweep of her hand,

&quot;Look at them Momomi. After all, what&#39;s to stop my one track mind from 
finding another distraction?&quot;

Her words laced with venom and references to their many preceding rows 
and fights, Kaname pulling as many strings as she could, sick and tired 
of the charade between them.

Gaze firmly set on the path before her, Momomi stated through gritted 
teeth,

&quot;We&#39;re in public Kaname.&quot;

The taller girl scoffed,

&quot;Since when did that make a difference to you?&quot; she asked, sneering 
viciously.

&quot;Ashamed of me all of a sudden?&quot; she replied with mock offence, before 
spitting her next line victoriously,

&quot;You never complained when we were still fucking!&quot;

A hushed gasp rippled around them, and Kaname set herself, waiting for 
the retort.

The embarrassment of being degraded amongst the juniors was enough to 
push the brunette over the edge, and stopping in her tracks, Momomi 
grabbed her girlfriend&#39;s arm, pulling the taller girl to face her.

&quot;What is it Kaname? What are you up to now?&quot;

Tears sprang to Momomi&#39;s soft brown eyes, and her face twisted with 
repressed feelings as they threatened to bubble over.

&quot;Happy? Is this what you wanted to see?&quot;

Biting the wave back, she set her jaw in defiance, pointing to her face 
dramatically,

&quot;See this Kenjo-san?&quot; and she paused a moment for effect,

&quot;It&#39;s the face of someone who couldn&#39;t give a fuck anymore!&quot;

And as she flounced off into the astonished crowd around her, Kaname 
waited a moment, watching the melodramatic fifth year disappear before 
smiling coolly, her dark eyes sparkling with achievement.

Even from the confines of her half-empty Dormitory, Yaya could clearly 
hear the enthusiastic calls of the students as they left the Cathedral, 
the old brass bell ringing true as it declared the end of term. Not long 
now, and the Strawberry Dorms would be an empty shell hibernating until 
the girls returned in spring.

Turning from the open window, the dark haired Spican surveyed the scene 
before her, the room now barren apart from Hikari&#39;s possessions and 
Yaya&#39;s bare essentials. The remainder or her belongs were now neatly 
organized in a stack of cardboard boxes in the centre of the room, her 
more delicate clothes and perishables in a suitcase beside them.

She&#39;d worked hard overnight to clear up, noting the appearance of 
several previously concealed holes in the plaster or marks in the wooden 
work from her moments of release earlier in the term. Unable to do 
anything about them now, Yaya hoped they would be over looked during the 
winter inspection.

There were only a few pieces left to pack, and Yaya stood in her night 
dress in the centre of the room, the third year still not having 
bothered to dress. She toyed with a limp art pad, her slender fingers 
flicking back and forth across a frayed corner.

Sighing at the sheer volume of her roommate&#39;s belongings left to remind 
her of the third year&#39;s absence, Yaya remained perplexed by Konohana&#39;s 
apparent choice not to collect them. Surely Hikari would at least need 
her school books over the holiday? The tiny blonde had missed a fair 
chunk of content ahead of the spring exams, and although her grades were 
respectable, they were bound to suffer if she didn&#39;t get some revision 
done.

Then with another heavy sigh, Yaya added; unless of course, she was 
already studying somewhere else.

Yaya tossed the sketch pad into the pile of stuff waiting to be sealed 
into the final box, her mood decidedly soured.

Even if the staff did allow Yaya to return come spring, which she very 
doubted given her behaviour since Hikari had left, she realised suddenly 
that more than likely, there would be no one here return to anyway.

This would be it. Once she left this Dormitory and the remains of her 
brief life with the young blonde, Hikari Konohana would be nothing more 
than a memory.

- - - - -

It was late evening when a soft knock echoed through Shizuma&#39;s Dormitory 
door, the silver haired sixth year looking up from her novel, smiling 
from her place curled up on the Dormitory bed.

Nagisa was out early this evening, she thought, and sitting up, she 
waited for the red head to appear.

But the door remained still, and Shizuma frowned for a moment, confused.

Again, a soft, awkward sounding knock rang against the surface.

Closing her book having made sure she&#39;d marked her place, Shizuma slid 
from the bed, her black uniform swishing as it brushed against the soft 
cotton sheets she&#39;d been stretched out across.

Calling softly as she approached the door, Shizuma pushed her trailing 
silver hair out of her eyes.

&quot;Come in?&quot; she urged.

Still nothing, and having reached the cool metal handle, the slender 
sixth year opened the door herself.

Stood in the hallway before her, juggling an unstable looking tower of 
compact disc cases was little Chiyo Tsukidate, her blue eyes troubled as 
she did her best to balance the stack and greet the former-Etoile 
correctly.

Intimidated in the presence of her onee-sama&#39;s girlfriend, Chiyo 
stammered,

&quot;For-former Etoile-sama,&quot; and she curtseyed awkwardly, almost sending 
the pile of clear plastic across the floor,

&quot;Is, is Etoile-sama Nagisa-senpai here?&quot; she asked in a small voice, her 
gaze averted to the floor.

The upperclassman smiled with bemusement, never having considered how 
her relationship with Nagisa might effect little Chiyo and the red 
headed Etoile&#39;s other adoring fans.

The first year was obviously completely besotted with the fourth year, 
and Shizuma smiled at the cute first year before her, realising how 
intimidating she must find the former-Etoile.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not Chiyo-chan, I believe she&#39;s still in council duty,&quot; she 
explained softly, doing her best to make herself as approachable as 
possible.

Chiyo looked about a second, shuffling uncomfortably as she fought with 
her embarrassment, her little face turning bright red at the unexpected 
reply.

Having practiced the request continuously on her way to the sixth year&#39;s 
Dormitory, the last thing she&#39;d expected to be told was that Nagisa 
wasn&#39;t there.

&quot;Um, um,&quot; she mumbled, once again almost dropping the stack.

Trying not to betray too much amusement, Shizuma looked cautiously at 
the precarious pile the first year was juggling.

&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to put those down for a moment 
Tsukidate-san?&quot; Shizuma asked, her eyebrow raised in concern.

Chiyo spurted forth the mechanics of her errand, caught up in the utmost 
importance of her task,

&quot;Oh no no former-Etoile-sama. Rokujo-san said I wasn&#39;t to put them down 
until I&#39;d given them safely to my onee-s...&quot; she stumbled at the phrase, 
noting Shizuma&#39;s gathering smile,

&quot;.,.to Aoi-sama. They&#39;re very important you see, and Etoile-sama needs 
to finish the listing before tomorrow.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s lips took a wry smile, and just as Chiyo lost her grip on one 
corner, Shizuma stepped forward to intervene. The top of the pile 
wobbled far above Chiyo&#39;s shoulders, and it was obvious the little first 
year wasn&#39;t going to complete the trip to the council chambers without 
dropping them.

Easing the pile from the first year&#39;s aching fingers, Shizuma hefted the 
stack and set them down carefully on the bedside table.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what Chiyo-chan,&quot; she said, turning to the little first 
year, smiling as warmly as she could,

&quot;Why don&#39;t you leave them here for a moment and go to the council 
chamber to find Etoile-sama. When you get there, you can stress how 
important it is that she finish up this work for Rokujo-san, which I&#39;m 
sure will get her out of meetings early,&quot; adding after a pause,

&quot;That will make her very happy don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Chiyo&#39;s blue eyes widened at the thought, completely missing the 
manipulation having been offered the chance to please her onee-sama. The 
tiny Miatorian beamed.

&quot;Oh!&quot;

She blushed, realising she&#39;d showed too much enthusiasm whilst 
addressing Nagisa&#39;s girlfriend and dropped her gaze once again to avoid 
Shizuma&#39;s piercing emerald gaze. Swallowing awkwardly, she explained in 
her tiny voice,

&quot;I&#39;ll do that right away former-Etoile-sama,&quot;

She curtsied briefly as she turned to hurry off down the corridor, 
bubbling over with excitement and an eagerness to reach the council 
chamber.

Trying to hide her smile, Shizuma added sternly,

&quot;No running Tsukidate-san!&quot;

Nodding attentively, Chiyo caught her enthusiasm and reminded herself to 
behave more correctly.

Watching for a moment as the tiny first year disappeared into the gloomy 
corridor, Shizuma shook her head with a smile and turned her attention 
to the pile of cases by her bed. Lifting the top few cases, she flicked 
through the stack in curiosity.

Under the first disc in the pile was a folded note, and scanning the 
page, the silver haired senior realised with a bemused frown that this 
was the music that Miyuki had prepared for the Christmas Ball, the 
tracks arranged in order of performance following the formal Etoile 
dance.

The tall Miatorian cringed, looking at some of the artist&#39;s names that 
caught her eye.

&quot;Oh Miyuki,&quot; she sighed, noting her former-roommates awful taste in 
music had yet to change.

- - - - -

Chikaru had baulked in surprise when Miyuki had failed to try her dress 
on upon collection, the Lulim senior finding herself perhaps even a 
little offended, having fully expected the Miatorian President to 
inspect her work.

But Miyuki had already risked far too much recollection on the Lulim 
girl&#39;s part, having approached her to alter the dress in the first 
place. The last thing she needed now was to risk Chikaru waking up to 
her ploy and voicing her memories to the rest of the seniors. 
Eventually, the school being the rumour mill it was, things would get 
back to Shizuma, and all her hard work would be for nothing.

Stood in the low light of her Dormitory, curtains drawn and only the dim 
illumination of her table lamp by which to see, Miyuki stood before the 
full length mirror in her bathroom, holding the long shimmery garment up 
against herself.

It was perfect; Chikaru had done exactly what the council senior had 
hoped she would. More than likely, the deeply set memories from her 
short stay in the second year with the Miatorian duo during the school 
French exchange had influenced her creative mind, the image in the 
mirror before Miyuki almost identical to that which she was trying to 
recreate.

Only a few finishing touches remained, all of which she would have dealt 
with by mid-morning while everyone else was wrapped up in the final 
hours before the Ball.

All the hard work having been done, she was sure even the hapless Nagisa 
would be able to cope with her remaining responsibilities, and if not, 
the endlessly attentive Tamao would be there to bail her out, leaving 
Miyuki free to complete her own preparations.

She sighed in satisfaction, setting her jaw and staring intently at the 
young woman looking back from the murky mirror image.

She&#39;d been good enough once. Perhaps now, in the dying embers of her 
time at Astrea, she might be once again.

- - - - -

&quot;Shizuma!&quot; Miyuki squealed, the third year&#39;s long black hair whipping 
about her face as she tumbled out onto the terrace. Giggling like a 
kinder garden junior, Shizuma almost followed her to the deck, managing 
to catch herself as she missed the tall step from the doorway onto the 
snow covered flagstones beneath.

Out on the high balcony above the school grounds proper, the entire 
panorama was sheet white, the storm having calmed earlier in the day but 
not without leaving the surroundings blanketed in soft pillows of 
marshmallow-like precipitate first.

Shizuma stood for a moment, her spinning head trying to decide whether 
or not she should be concerned for the limp form in the snow before her. 
But Miyuki was still busy laughing, and Shizuma grinned as she reached 
down, offering a hand to her fallen room mate,

&quot;You&#39;re supposed to lose your head Miyuki, not your feet,&quot; she teased.

Warm breath leaving curling trails in the night air, the pair held each 
other still for a moment as the third year regained her feet, the 
mixture of the evening&#39;s heady pace and the intoxicating warmth of the 
alcohol coursing through their veins having left both girls in complete 
disarray.

Miyuki had never drunk so much alcohol before, and it was only when her 
rebellious room mate had promised it would help with her nerves that 
Miyuki was coxed into the first few sips, the dress she was wearing 
leaving the council assistant feeling awkward and exposed. And for good 
reason too, she thought, noting her bare thighs which were covered in 
flecks of snow, the blue satin seams of her garment damp from where 
she&#39;d fallen.

But as the evening had progressed and the vodka had begun to do it&#39;s 
job, those first few sips had become one or two more, followed by 
several measured top ups until eventually, in wild abandon, the curved 
half bottle had been left with little more than a few final drops 
within.

Unable to feel the cold, her skin almost as warm as her glowing face, 
Miyuki was now far beyond caring about the consequences.

The two girls had spent most of the evening fleeing from a trio of 
overly voracious French boys who had gate crashed the school Ball. Local 
culture not big on following rules or tying the line, the gate staff had 
hardly blinked an eye when a number of local lads, having caught wind of 
a party at the high class academy, had marched on the antiquated hall in 
their best dress, hoping to woo some of the young talent within.

Much akin to wolves in the sheep&#39;s pen, the lads had run riot, the 
occasional Sister doing their best to shoo the boys from the premises, 
only too have them re-enter through a different entrance a little later.

One group in particular, obviously never having seen oriental girls 
before, took a distinct liking to Shizuma&#39;s unique hair colour and 
Miyuki&#39;s eye-catching attire, following them around the Hall 
continuously, bombarding the pair with relentless comments and remarks, 
trying to get the girl&#39;s attentions.

Having failed with the politer options, it hadn&#39;t taken the trio long to 
lower the tone, making it very clear what they had in mind.

Over exaggerated anxiety caught up with Miyuki and she turned her head 
back to the door, brown eyes wide as she peered into the darkness 
beyond,

&quot;Are they gone Shizuma?&quot; she asked, straining to make shapes out in the 
gloom.

Shizuma giggled,

&quot;I think so, weren&#39;t they still by the cloak room looking for us?&quot; she 
replied, turning her own head to glance behind her.

In the brisk wind, her long silver locks bellowed around her and she 
pushed her fringe awkwardly from her face as she turned back to her room 
mate.

Catching Miyuki&#39;s worried gaze, she burst into another giggling fit, 
covering her mouth with one hand as she almost doubled over.

&quot;What was that they were saying outside the loos? Something about my 
bum?&quot; she asked, losing the battle to maintain a straight face. Miyuki 
blanched with an appalled look for a moment, remembering the crude 
demands following the pair as they&#39;d dashed into the girls toilets for 
safety.

Taking on a look of deep concentration, Miyuki attempted to control her 
fuzzy brain long enough to complete a proper translation, her stoic 
expression cracking as she began converting some of the cruder phrases 
from French to Japanese.

&quot;Come on Miyuki, you&#39;re supposed to be good at this remember?&quot; Shizuma 
pushed impatiently, poking her friend&#39;s satin wrapped tummy in 
agitation, causing Miyuki to buckle and almost fall to the floor again.

Miyuki reeled and paused, letting a wave of dizziness pass, waiting 
until she&#39;d recovered before continuing to fumble over the words. Her 
cheeks were a rosy colour as it was, the shade only deepening as she 
dealt with some of the lewder comments,

&quot;The blonde one with the silly shirt,&quot; she said, doing her best with the 
vague mental image,

&quot;He said you had great-&quot; and Miyuki&#39;s face flushed deep crimson as she 
approached such unfamiliar and usually unacceptable language.

&quot;Said what?&quot; Shizuma prompted, her green eyes sparkling with mischief,

&quot;Miyuki, get on with it!&quot; she demanded.

Miyuki caught her breath, pausing before continuing,

&quot;He said you had great breasts. And-,&quot;

She tried not to grin, her face taking a stern look, the dark haired 
third year attempting to appear disapproving and politically correct,

&quot;And she said he wanted to bite your ass, because he thought it looked 
juicy.&quot;

Shizuma twisted backwards, staring theatrically at her posterior with a 
raised eyebrow.

&quot;Bite it?&quot; she mumbled with an alarmed expression, and Miyuki lost 
control, intoxication coursing through her veins, prompting another fit 
of laughter. Closing her eyes, she felt chill tears roll across her warm 
cheeks,

Shizuma followed suit, her serious pretence buckling to fresh giggling.

&quot;There was more,&quot; Miyuki said, managing to regain control.

&quot;The other guy, the one with the stupid glasses?&quot; she gestured vaguely,

&quot;He said, um,&quot; and she struggled with one word in particular,

&quot;chatte, vagin?&quot; she mumbled, her gaze losing focus.

Shizuma&#39;s deep eyes flashed as she rolled the delicious word from her 
tongue,

&quot;Pussy&quot;

Miyuki covered her crimson face as she doubled over again.

Half grinning as she watched her fellow third year, Shizuma remarked 
bluntly,

&quot;But I&#39;m not sure I want that one translated,&quot; she said, suddenly 
uncomfortable with the idea of some smelly Frenchmen letching over her 
so graphically. Sobered by the image, she caught the degree of silliness 
in their conversation and decided it was time for them both to calm 
down. Trying to steady herself and the giggling third year before her, 
she placed a hand on each of Miyuki&#39;s bare arms.

In retrospect, she&#39;d probably fed Miyuki a little too much vodka, and 
she grinned again at the thought of the usually straight laced council 
assistant being so roaringly drunk.

But as the amusement passed, she stood for a moment, the world around 
them still apart from the whistle of the frosty wind whipping across the 
courtyard and the soft spasms of the Miatorian council assistant that 
Shizuma was holding.

As the haze and distraction dropped away, her perception cleared in the 
roaring silence, Shizuma taking in her class mate&#39;s proximity, the 
warmth of Miyuki&#39;s skin and the shifting fabric of the third year&#39;s 
dress as she breathed.

Miyuki was still lost in her amusement, head hung, her long dark hair 
shimmering in the starlight as the wind shuffled it to and fro.

Enthralled, Shizuma smiled softly, her bottomless green eyes considering 
the form before her. As drunk as she might be, there was no denying that 
on this night, in these circumstances and in that dress, Miyuki was 
simply stunning.

Her eyes narrowed to glistening emerald slits and Shizuma whispered 
softly,

&quot;So tell me Miyuki, didn&#39;t they say anything about you?&quot;

Oblivious to Shizuma&#39;s attentions, Miyuki raised her head to reply.

&quot;Um, that blonde guy, he said-&quot; and she paused, catching something very 
different about Shizuma&#39;s gaze.

&quot;He said um...&quot;

She fumbled over the repeated words, becoming acutely aware of the tone 
of her roommate&#39;s intent stare. For a second she was back in the French 
dormitory, Shizuma looking her over as she held the unfurled dress 
against herf.

That piercing Hanazono look, the deep emerald pools threatening to 
devour her whole.

&quot;Said what Miyuki?&quot; Shizuma purred softly, trapping the third year&#39;s 
brown eyes with her own. Leaning closer, she tipped her head slightly 
with a mischievous expression.

Miyuki&#39;s cheeks flushed deep crimson and she dropped her gaze,

&quot;He said he wanted to...&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s lips became a single luscious curve, the ends beginning to 
curl with amusement. Gratification surged through her as she watched 
Miyuki become self aware, the dark haired girl avoiding Shizuma&#39;s stare, 
her chest rising and falling and her dark pupils swimming wide as goose 
bumps formed on her skin.

&quot;Wanted to what Miyuki?&quot; she pushed, the game in hand all too familiar 
but so much more compelling given the person she was playing with.

She&#39;d never been this aroused before; the idea of tasting her room 
mate&#39;s lips as intoxicating as it was wrong.

Through her dark fringe, Miyuki glanced up, anxious and awkward when she 
found Shizuma was still staring at her,

&quot;He said he wanted to... wants to... to fuck me,&quot; she finished, 
struggling uncomfortably with the unfamiliar word.

Shizuma smiled, riding the building expectation within her,

&quot;He wants to fuck my Miyuki does he?&quot; She asked, emphasising the 
ownership, feeling the other girl squirm at the repeated expletive.

Raising Miyuki&#39;s chin with delicate fingers, she leaned closer still, 
bringing her lips close enough to brush against Miyuki&#39;s soft skin.

Miyuki paused, frozen solid by the moment. She&#39;d never kissed someone 
before, let alone like this.

Shizuma was her roommate, her friend. In early years, she&#39;d been her 
mentor.

This was...

Miyuki looked away, turning her cheek to the girl beside her. Staring at 
something, anything other than Shizuma, she mumbled quietly,

&quot;N.. Not my thing.&quot;

She stayed there for what seemed like an age, each heart beat marking 
the passage of time, her breath coming short.

Shizuma tipped her head further to one side, her long silver mane 
falling across one shoulder. Seeing the awkwardness in Miyuki&#39;s eyes, 
the look of apprehension so apparent amongst the other emotions written 
across the girl&#39;s face, Shizuma leaned back, sighing softly.

&quot;Oh Miyuki,&quot; she whispered, brushing a fond hand across her room mate&#39;s 
cheek.

Miyuki was curled up almost defensively, her face hidden by her hair, 
the young woman similar to a petrified deer under bright headlights. 
Seeing the discomfort and knowing she&#39;d pushed the boundaries, the 
Miatorian temptress let the moment go, taking another step back and 
bowing her head.

An awkward moment of silence passed, after which Shizuma looked up from 
beneath her fringe, grinning playfully as she tried to brush the 
difficult atmosphere aside,

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Miyuki, I&#39;ll get you one day,&quot; she teased.

Then with a swish of red fabric and the flick of her long silver locks, 
the third year disappeared back into the dance hall, opting to leave the 
dark haired girl alone long enough to regain her composure.

Watching her room mate go, Miyuki straightened up, the flush of the 
alcohol gone, the heady pace of the earlier evening lost. Stood alone, 
increasingly cold and now very much sober, she felt a sinking feeling in 
her stomach, a land slide of emotion washing away as the built up 
apprehension passed.

Curling her bare arms around herself, her long black hair sheltering 
exposed shoulders from the icy wind, the council assistant gazed after 
the Miatorian, the bold temptress having left a swathe of unrest in her 
wake as per usual. Still blushing, Miyuki&#39;s face took a sad expression, 
the council assistant suddenly feeling very alone.

She dipped her gaze, considering the spider web of their entwined foot 
prints in the snow beneath her.

Round and round they went; a mishmash of their crossed paths.

Miyuki looked back towards the waiting doorway,

&quot;Not my thing,&quot; she repeated to herself wistfully, and brushed a single 
finger tip gingerly across her lips.
