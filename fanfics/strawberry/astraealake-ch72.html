<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This chapter  got away from me a little, but I liked how it turned out. I'm open to  the accusation that the last bit is filler- heck, it <em>is </em>filler- but I think it adds something to the table anyway. Hopefully you'll agree.</span></p>

Kaname leaned back on her bed,  looking up and smiling as Momomi walked in. “Yo.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi.” Momomi dumped  their lunches in Kaname’s lap then threw herself forwards onto her  girlfriend’s bed, sighing hugely. “What a crappy day…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? Something  wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, of course not,  I’m just pissed off because a first year tried to kill me with a  pencil sharpener.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, right. Well,  considering pencil sharpeners are not lethal weapons and first years  are not lethal, I’m sure you’ll survive the trauma.” Kaname  leaned back slightly, resting her hands on the bed. “But my day was  good, thanks for asking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez. You suck.  That’s no fun at all.” Momomi prodded Kaname on the arm, pouting  cutely. “But thanks for your overwhelming concern, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Is something  wrong, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted, turning  and looking at the ceiling. “Yes, there is, Miss Oh-so-literal. I’m  in really bad mood, and you aren’t doing anything to help me with  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what’s up,  then?” Kaname touched Momomi’s leg idly, glancing at the girl.  “Listening to explain it is going to be less painful than your  heavy-handed hints, sadly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Smartarse.” Momomi  puffed her cheeks out. “Well, half of it you know anyway, not that  you care. But am I really the only one who thinks Olesa is being a  stupid, foolish, easily-distracted little twerp?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean the transfer  thing, or just generally?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Either is good. But  mostly the former.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Well,  it’s natural enough, isn’t it? For someone like her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just because it’s  natural, that doesn’t mean that it’s smart. She’ll be moving a  worse environment with more religion, less freedoms and poor  accommodation. This is a unique, after all, or so my mother tells  me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m sure  Spain has some perfectly decent schools for people rich and  privileged enough to pay through the nose for education for their  perfect little children,” Kaname muttered. “That’s not what I  meant, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is the point,  though? This school’s perfectly good in every respect. Why go  through the hassle and chaos of a whole new transfer just for the  sake of it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To leave her  reputation as a troublemaker behind?” Kaname suggested. “Don’t  you wish you could do that from time to time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. That’s  just a lazy and stupid attitude. You just have to carry yourself with  pride… that certainly isn’t a problem for her. But more than  that, it really is such an unnecessary thing to do. She doesn’t get  that many problems from her reputation, which in any case is a lot  better than ours.” Momomi shook her head irritably. “What else is  there to say? To be close to her mother? She’ll be staying at a  boarding school, anyway. And that goes for cultural differences, too.  The rich and segregated are the same everywhere, I can assure you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, who knows?”  Kaname shrugged. “She thinks it’s a good idea, so that’s that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t make  it a good idea! The whole thing’s just bloody stupid, what can I  say?” Momomi huffed. “Even if they think it’s a good idea, an  idiot’s idea is an idiot’s idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you say so…”  Kaname sighed, rubbing her nose, and wondered when Momomi would work  the issue out of her system.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not any time soon,  apparently. “And Amiki!” Momomi continued, turning her head back  to face the wall behind her. She held that position for a few  moments, stretching, then curled inwards in a catlike manner. Her  hands rested on the bed. “Amiki just plain pisses me off. Yes,  ojou-sama, no ojou-sama, soon we shall be the ultimate power in the  universe ojou-sama. Doesn’t she have any independent views at all?  It’s pretty annoying, talking to Olesa’s PR woman.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I can certainly  understand your sentiments,” Kaname admitted. “But aren’t you  being a little harsh all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  nothing harsh about it. She’s got such a martyr complex, you know  that. She’ll sacrifice the heavens and the earth if it’ll make  Olesa happy. No, that’s not it. She’ll sacrifice everything even  if Olesa only <em>thinks </em>something  will make her happy, regardless of Amiki’s own opinion on the  matter. Stupid, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not stupid as  such, because it isn’t a matter of dependence. She decides, over  and over, to live that way… now, anyway. You were probably more  right before, but I think she’s changed.” Kaname sighed. “Did I  just defend Amiki? That’s just plain messed up, right there. What  is the world coming to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know, but I  still don’t think anything’s changed. Olesa exploits Amiki, Amiki  says she thinks that’s fine, so Olesa exploits her… it goes on.  I’m a member of Olesa’s class but I find that kind of deference  disgusting.” Momomi yawned slightly. “This thing with the schools  is just case and point. You can tell it’s Olesa’s idea, through  it all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My guess would be  that Amiki is more argumentative when they are private. In public,  they maintain the public face.” Kaname chuckled, trying to lighten  the tone. “Unlike us, who argues wherever we damn please, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned  irritably. “I know that. But it’s not like Amiki’s ever changed  anything when it really matters…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t know that.  But even if you’re right, these are all Amiki’s choices, aren’t  they?” Kaname shook her head. “People as intelligent as those two  at least deserve to</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">be hoisted by their own  petard, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi prodded her in  the flank with her toe, scowling at her. “What’s up with all the  arguments, anyway? You bash those two all the time, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you generally  provide the balance in moments like that,” Kaname observed. “I’m  just completing the role-reversal.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked away,  frowning lightly. “As ever, you’re quick with a smart answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you in a bad  mood,” Kaname teased, looking down at her with affectionate eyes.  “Are you that fluffy and defensive about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking  about?” Momomi demanded. “This stuff just makes me angry, that’s  all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s a little  hard to take you seriously when you’re lying down like that.”  Kaname placed a hand on her girlfriend’s stomach, smirking. “No  general’s ever won a war without getting out of bed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi simply looked  away again, face unreadable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”  Kaname asked, seriously for once. “Got a stomach-ache?” <em>Well,  mostly serious.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t it bother  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Olesa and Amiki  leaving?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mm.” Momomi nodded  briefly, folding her arms behind her head and sighing wistfully. “I  mean, we haven’t known each other for all that long in relative  terms, and to say it’s been fraught is to make a huge  understatement, but all the same… won’t you miss them? Isn’t  annoying to have something like that ending, almost as soon as it  began?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it is a little  annoying, I guess.” Kaname took her hand away, falling backwards  herself and resting her head on Momomi’s legs. “But it’s not  like they’ll be controlled by that. If we wanted something, we’d  be the same. So it’s natural, and not something I resent them for.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not that I  resent them for it. I just think they’re making a stupid decision.”  Momomi frowned at her. “Hey. Don’t lie there. Move, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. I like it here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lazy bastard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But, stupid, is it?”  Kaname mused, stretching her arms. “I suppose you could say that.  It’s not our decision, though. Like I said before, they’ll do  what they like. Do point in getting worked up about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s such a  careless attitude…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not careless. I  just know what’s worth my time caring about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it’s just me,  huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname turned her head,  but Momomi was looking away again. She frowned, momentarily wondering  how to approach the problem. “Well, you’re the only one stubborn  enough to tell people how to live. Not even Shion’s that bad, now  is she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not giving them  orders. I’m just annoyed that they chose this, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re only  considering it. As Olesa says, you shouldn’t get too ahead of  yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know.” Momomi  closed her eyes and shook her head. “It just doesn’t make sense  to me, though. They’ve been here for two years without any  complaints, and now when they actually have true friends, not  lackeys, they decide to fly off somewhere… what’s the matter? Are  they scared or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“True friends, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, not really,”  Momomi replied hastily. “It’s just a figure of speech. But we’re  a lot closer to that than anyone else they’ve ever had. Because  it’s them, of course, that isn’t hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can see that.  You’re cute when you’re defensive, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As I’m the one who  does that more often! I’m not being defensive!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes.” Kaname  smiled, pleased by her temper. “But it’s probably your fault, you  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? Is being my  friend that arduous for them, or something?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” Kaname shook  her head lightly. “Not at all. But you said a lot of silly things  to her… the most important was that she should take everything,  fulfil her obligations and live her own life both. That’s the kind  of thing that’s made her change, and do superfluous things like  this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Momomi  snorted. “Honestly, isn’t this the opposite of living for  everything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, give them a  chance to make new friends, if they want it. We’ve both said that  this school is too sheltered, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well, wherever  she’s going next is probably going to be just as bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one told them  that, though.” Kaname shrugged. “Besides, we can still keep in  touch. This is the modern age, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wouldn’t be the  same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re a  touching friend for them, anyway.” Kaname smiled. “So the best  thing you can do is accept that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if the two  concepts go together,” Momomi retorted. “You’re my girlfriend,  but I argue with you more often than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s what  I’d say to a normal person, anyway. You’re somewhat different,  like you said, so forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know just how to  cheer me up, don’t you?” Momomi observed sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Naturally. I’ve  been around you for long enough, haven’t I?” Kaname smiled. “So,  how about some exciting Biology?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Drop dead.” Momomi  slid one of her legs out from under Kaname’s head, pressing it  against Kaname’s neck and nearly choking her. “You’re not  allowed to move. I haven’t finished complaining about the futility  of existence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ow! That hurts!”  Kaname managed to shift Momomi’s leg downwards to moderately less  painful regions. “Honestly, you don’t let me get comfortable, do  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you ever let me be  comfortable? It’s only fair.” Momomi shook her head darkly. “This  one, though, you probably won’t argue…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, forget it, I  guess. It isn’t too important.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just being  broody, that’s all. Besides, you’ll only be sarcastic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Does this have  anything to do with Amane, then? Especially after she didn’t ride  with you in breaktime…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do you know about  that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was in the  audience, obviously. Or have you conveniently forgotten the fact that  I’m always looking over you?” Kaname sighed, shaking her head.  “I’m so unappreciated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’d be  right, anyway,” Momomi said. “Now that goes beyond bloody  annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do she doesn’t turn  up. That just means she’s sick, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She turned up to the  stables, at least, so you can’t have been watching us very  carefully.” Momomi turned sideways, looking across the room. “But  it’s very annoying. Even after all this time, she’s still as cold  and aloof as all that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As all that?”  Kaname asked. “What’s she done now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She was in a foul  mood. Something Koike did or said to her, that much was obvious. But  she didn’t tell me anything at all. She said it had nothing to do  with me.” Momomi snorted. “Honestly, what kind of reply is that?  Even if she doesn’t want to be bothered, can’t she put it a  little more politely?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Koike?  What’s that psychotic girl doing now? ‘I like Amane’,  indeed…but if she can bother the ice prince at all, perhaps she’s  not as irrelevant as she seems. </em>“Well, this  is Amane we’re talking about. What did you expect from her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know.  Something. Anything. It’s not like I haven’t put the effort in.  She’s such hard work, but she never does anything herself. And she  doesn’t even appreciate what I do! If it’s nothing to do with me,  what do you have to give to be someone relevant to her? Give blood?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname chuckled. “I  wouldn’t be surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not joking.”  Momomi pushed herself up, sliding her legs off the bed and resting  them on the floor. She gave the opposite wall a stare that told it  not to try anything funny if it wanted to live. “I’m hardly like  anyone else in that situation, now am I? She should know by now, I’m  not a bloody fangirl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not,” Kaname replied neutrally, unsure of what tone to  strike. <em>She’s exercising my mind today, now  isn’t she?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scowled deeply.  “All the same, though, even if she’s cold and careless, I give a  damn about her! I don’t have any idea why, but I do! I care! Even  though she’s shoved so many troubles away with her ‘ah’, even  if she’s defensive, manipulative and vaguely hostile to everyone  around her, even if she’s always troubling me, I still give a damn.  Because she’s so… lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  nodded briefly. <em>So this is the real thing. The  other stuff was just a prologue.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How can you sympathise with a  lonely person who deliberately drives everyone else away, though?”  Momomi asked. “I was the same, I should know, and Olesa and Amiki  as well, and even Shion a little… and you. We were all lonely and  defensive but we still opened up to each other over time. It wasn’t  like we really chose to be that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was it that bad,  then? I mean, she’s always been defensive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was pretty bad.  But what she said isn’t the important thing, really. It’s just  frustrating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Frustrating?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Earlier, when she  told me about herself, just a little, I thought I was getting  somewhere, but-” Momomi shook her head furiously. “This time,  when she actually had a current problem, she pushed me away that  easily. So what’s up with her? What did I do wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s a cliché,  but there’s no helping some people.” Kaname shrugged. “She’s  stubborn and strong enough to reject you even if she needs you. Like  Olesa and Amiki’s decision, shouldn’t you respect that choice?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s just so…  useless.” Momomi glanced sharply at her. “This is different.  After this kind of time and effort, it just pisses me off. I’m not  someone who comes and goes for her convenience! I’m not going to  let her get away that easily!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  stared at her, frowning slightly. <em>She has that  look about her again. This isn’t good, to say the least. Whatever I  say or do now she’s still going to shoot off and do something  stupid. It’s a matter of pride, and her pride is even bigger than  mine when it finally comes into play…</em>“Well,  like I said. If this is how she wants things, shouldn’t you just go  with it? Isn’t it rude to charge in again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is tough love.  Like I said, I never talked to her just to reinforce her ego in the  first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Well, it’s  not like you’ve ever achieved anything but that, to be honest. Has  she ever listened to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s listened, and  she has cared, and she has entrusted some things to me… I know  that.” Momomi’s hands curled inwards, gripping her skirt. “But  somehow, I don’t know exactly, but I’ve never gone quite far  enough. Whatever I am to her, it’s been someone she can’t fully  trust. She can never take that extra step. It’s so… I don’t  know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You talk about it as  if it’s your fault, but it’s probably not. If she can’t trust  you, that’s not your fault.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, what she  thinks doesn’t matter. I’ll make her trust me, if I have to!  That’s why I’m not through just yet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mightn’t  that make her hate you?” Kaname warned. <em>As I  thought, she just won’t give up. </em>“Is that  what you want? You know she hates anyone who invades her precious  personal space. Isn’t this way better than that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. I know  already, but I’m not that kind of person… I won’t let anyone  drift away from me! I’d rather see it all shatter and fall apart  than see someone drift away from me. Whoever they are! Do you get it,  Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s eyes widened.  “I get it, already. But why? Isn’t it just a lot easier to do let  go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because if I sit  around now, then I’ll worry and wonder later. I’ll kill all my  hopes now, if I have to. When I said to Olesa, to fight and win at  everything, to take everything…” Momomi waved a hand vaguely.  “You know what I mean. This is that, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Kaname  looked down at the bed, her brow wrinkling. “So that’s why you’re  going so far for her...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you,  Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What would you do in  my position?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “What,  I wonder? You know, I don’t know at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess you’ve  never been in that position,” Momomi muttered spitefully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname ran a hand  through her hair, feeling increasingly tired. “So, what now? Shall  we finally get to work?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m going to see  Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, didn’t  I? I presume you were listening.” Momomi stood up, brushing herself  off. “Depending on how things go, I’ll be back, sooner or later.  Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry about  it?” Kaname stood as well, glaring at her. “What do you mean,  don’t worry about it? Do you think I’m just going to let you skip  whenever you like?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, this is  important for me, even if you don’t give a damn. So forget it, I’ll  be here tomorrow, won’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you are,  you’re going to waste twenty minutes eating and ten minutes-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? This is the  first time you’ve complained about it, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maybe, but this is  getting to a problem,” Kaname retorted. “I told you, didn’t I?  This exam isn’t anything you can take lightly! You can’t just fly  off whenever you feel like it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn’t whenever  I feel like it!” Momomi snapped. “I told you it all anyway, even  if you were only half-listening. So for those reasons, I’m going to  see her now. You understand, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, actually, I don’t  understand. I never bloody have.” Kaname folded her arms. “Why  are you going so far for her, damnit? She doesn’t give a damn about  you anyway, so what’s the bloody point?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps you wouldn’t  understand, considering you hate her so much, but you should  remember… the old Kaname wasn’t someone who gave a damn about me  either!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “So  she’s the new me now, is she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s herself, but  more like you than you’d think. Is there a problem with that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course there’s a  problem with that! You’re wasting her time, your time, and my time  on a stupid pig-headed way to work out your guilt! That’s the  problem!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And how about  you, who didn’t care until just now? Aren’t you just saying  things for your own convenience? I’m getting sick and tired of your  bloody feud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m saying things I  thought I wouldn’t have to say, because you’re going way too  far!” Kaname took a step forwards, looking down at her girlfriend.  “You can waste your time but there should be limits, and this is  it. Are you even going to achieve anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know, but  whatever. You can stay here and study or whatever is worrying you.”  Momomi turned and walked towards the door. “It’s got nothing to  do with you, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!” Kaname  snatched up her pillow, throwing it hard and hitting Momomi on the  back of the head. “What did you just say, damnit? Are you even  listening to yourself!” Momomi stopped. “Hey, answer me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi turned her head,  eyes wavering, face locked into a frown. “It’s true for you,  isn’t it? You don’t care about Amane, you don’t want to care,  and you don’t even try to pretend to care, so it’s irrelevant to  you! That’s what you want, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t give a fuck  about Amane! But I do care about you, damnit!” Kaname stared at  her, her stomach fluttering unpleasantly. “Though I don’t know  why… but it’s you as well as her we’re talking about! Of course  it has something to do with me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But isn’t about you  or her! Can’t you just give it up, already! She’s the one being  annoying, I don’t need this crap from you as well!” Momomi kicked  the pillow irritably. “Get it into your bloody thick head for once!  Not everything is a contest between you and Amane!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you should notice  that you can’t just eliminate yourself from the equation when it  suits you!” Kaname stared at her, half-wondering what it was she  was saying right now. “So perhaps Amane rates you alongside her  third-best horse. What of it? How about my feelings? Aren’t my  feelings stronger? Aren’t I the one who loves you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared at her for  a moment, shocked, and Kaname dared to hope that she’d stay after  all. But her eyes fell into that gaze and her face sat in that way  and she knew it was over, all over again. “Even then, you can’t  monopolise me! What right have you to control me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who said anything  about that! Don’t be egotistical!” Kaname shouted, gritting her  teeth in frustration. “You can’t monopolise me either, Momomi!  You can’t leave and do what you like, presuming I’ll stay here  and be around whenever you feel it! I’m not taking that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, for Christ’s  sake, you’re overreacting! It’s for one bloody lunchtime, get a  sense of perspective!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So it’s one  lunchtime! But I’ve heard that before, haven’t I? First it was  morning and break, now we’re doing your bloody play, and you think  it’s fine to go swanning off to Amane now as well! One way or the  other, this is the only real time we have together any more. I’m  your girlfriend, aren’t I? So how much more of that is she going to  take away from me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you, this  isn’t about you! This doesn’t have anything to do with you! Can’t  you understand that this is something I care about?” Momomi stepped  forwards, throwing her arm to the side in frustration. “It’s  always about you, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s my line!  It’s always you and your bloody aspirations! Olesa, Shion, Amane,  the play, always, always, always what’ll advantage you! Why do we  have to conquer everything? Are you ever going to get around to being  satisfied with what you have?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glared at her for  a long moment. “It’s better than staying here and rotting in here  isn’t it? If you want to go back to that, you can!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Things are… fuck  it. Fuck it all. Fuck you.” Kaname turned her back, shoving her  hands in her pockets. “Do what you like!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will,  whether I have your permission or not.” Momomi turned and flounced  away, shoving the door open and stepping outside. She paused  momentarily and looked over her shoulder. “Aren’t you  hypocritical, though? <em>Let them do what they  like…</em>why are you getting off your ass for  this one, all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname turned, red eyes  wild. “Get out!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  slammed the door. Two seconds later, Kaname kicked it, hurting her  foot in the process. She ignored the pain and a sneaking paranoia  concerning her biggest toe, slamming a fist against the door for good  measure. “Damnit!” Her breathing was ragged, her body shaking.<em>Five seconds. I swear, five more seconds, and  I would have smashed that smug face to pieces…God knows she  deserved it! Who the hell does she think she is? Is this all I am,  damnit? Someone to leave behind? Just an interesting thing to play  around with? She’ll bend at the knees for Amane but she won’t  give me the time of day, and where’s the justice in that? She’s  just the most stupid, inelegant, arrogant egotistical manipulative  cruel stupid brat! What hasn’t she done? That’s my line too! How  much further can I have gone? What haven’t I given already! For all  she complains about Amane, it’s only about her own interests, she  doesn’t care about my sacrifices! What the hell am I supposed to  do? Sit back and let her do what she likes? She said it herself,  didn’t she? Better to end it in flames than let it slip away from  you slowly. </em>Kaname smiled ironically. <em>What  fucking stupid advice. </em>Her knees folded under  her and she slid down the door, kneeling in front of the floor. She  bit her lip and closed her eyes, trying to stop her body from  shaking. <em>What happened to the anger? Isn’t  that better? Isn’t anger and hate better? Right now, I just feel  sick. That’s all. Ill and disgusted, with her and with myself and  with Amane…damnit! What’s wrong with me? It shouldn’t be this  painful. She doesn’t care, it’s ‘nothing to do with me’! So  why am I letting her win like this? Am I that dependant on her now?  Damnit! What am I supposed to do?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sat  there for a few moments, collecting herself, then she forced herself  to her feet. She rubbed her eyes and shook out her hair angrily.<em>Okay, so it hurts. Deal with it! Sitting here  and being miserable is what you did before, and that’s just too  pathetic! So what are you going to do? Cry and rot in this room,  waiting for her to come back? And perhaps she’ll be gracious and  kiss it better? Screw that! I’m not that weak, not then and not  now. So what? Shion? Serané? Kariya? Even Amiki? Am I going to  sink that low again? </em>She breathed deeply,  drawing on her new-found anger. <em>Am I going to  beg for help again, like some kind of bedraggled bird blown around by  a squall? Why should I? How am I going to grow if I keep acting like  that? What are they going to think of me if I keep acting like that?  And what is Momomi going to say? That I’m clingy? As if I’d give  her the satisfaction… I’m not beaten by this. I’m tougher than  this. So this time, I won’t rely on anyone. This time, I’ll deal  with it myself, the good and the bad. I’m not some spoiled brat, I  can do that much. Even if she expects me to rot here for her  convenience, I’ll show her how much I’ve grown! Even if she  hasn’t noticed! </em>A smaller voice added <em>even  if I’ve grown for her. </em>That voice still  sounded like Kariya, and she still hated it. <em>I’m  stronger now, and I won’t let anyone forget that!</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She opened the door and stepped out,  slamming it after her. A vase full of wilting roses vibrated on the  dresser behind her.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Love, is it? If there’s any concept that humans  abuse left, right and centre, it would be love. If I am willing to  die for a cause, I am a fanatic. If I am willing to die for my  country’s cause, I am noble. But we call people who die for the  ones they love heroes. Why? What influence does a single couple, a  single family, a single moment of unending time have? Causes are  greater than people, that much is obvious. An ideal or a cause is a  family in itself, a family of believers, united by their common  ground and their common determination to change the world itself.  They are immortal, insofar as the cause will live on without them,  generations afterwards. And they are far more significant, insofar as  a single cause, a single group of true believers willing to fight and  spill blood can actually change this world, one way or an other. But  that kind of person is still considered strange at best, an idiot at  worst, someone who wastes their life with no purpose and no meaning  to it. But if you die for your love, under any circumstance  imaginable, people will say that you did the right thing. You were a  hero. That’s how it is. I simplify, of course. The soldiers of a  victorious cause, an ideal that has triumphed, are hailed as heroes,  even as those who fail are forgotten. But for love, unconditionally,  forever, always, dying for that simple emotion can be considered a  true selfless act. It’s just a feeling that moves nothing in this  world. Dying in each other’s arms is supposed to be romantic. But  where is the meaning in that? To live, live and breathe and love  again, with someone else, isn’t that what should be? We come into  this world alone. We should leave that way as well. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike  pricked her finger against a thorn, frowning and looking at the red  blood that oozed outwards. <em>I’d like to say  that I thought like that. But I can believe in that as well, the  nobility of dying together, the idea that this is a feeling that can  transcend everything else in this world. Do idealists feel the same  burning passion? Do they instinctively understand what drives their  opponents, even as they are locked in a deadly struggle? Are the  meanings inherent in those deaths lost on anyone who has not felt  that same passion? After all, not many people can dedicate their  lives to a cause. But we all believe in love. It’s a ridiculous,  self-indulgent emotion, a hopeless piece of self-gratification, a  delusional dream that we collectively cling to because it feels happy  and satisfying amidst a chaotic and dangerous and thoroughly unhappy  world. Will love feed Africa? Will love halt global warming? Can we  really make love, not war? Of course not. But in the heart of  people’s hearts, they don’t care about that stuff anyway. They  just want to be happy, themselves, and because love makes you happy  at the best of times we all elevate it. That’s so universal that  it’s the closest thing we get to an admission of our own  selfishness. Unsurprising, then, that the notion of romantic love is  strongest in the western world. That’s where it belongs, isn’t  it, along with rampant commercialism and individual self-interest?</em>She brushed her finger against her lips. <em>But  even if I recognise that intellectually, I’m no different. I still  cling to this thing called love. Even now, I use it as a device to  reconstruct my mental self, becoming a tragic heroine rather than a  sad girl with a crush… hilarious. But that’s the nature of love,  isn’t it? Love can excuse the most horrific of crimes far more  easily than a mere ideal.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike opened her eyes.  “Oh? So you found me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You bitch! What the  hell did you tell Amane?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Koike smirked, looking  down at the floor. “All in all, probably not what you think.”</span></p>
