<p>Momomi tapped her foot against the ground impatiently, waiting for Kaname to come out. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She’s  seriously slow, but I’ll forgive her. It’s fun to assemble these  outfits for her. It’s a strange thing, because I never took much  interest in this stuff for myself. No, truthfully, my sister took  interest in this stuff for me, and so I gained knowledge of it myself,  I suppose. And now I’m propagating the cycle by “taking care of  Kaname”. She’s the best kind of doll, a human one, because she lets me  play with her hair all the time and adjust her clothes, and now it’s  dress-up outright. Just like those dating sims. I doubt life’s as  convenient and ridiculously over-sexed as them, though, so I’ll  concentrate on making her look nice. Showing her off can wait until she  has something to show off. It’s a lot of fun, but it also makes me feel  needed, and it gives me a small sense of possession, of ownership. I  suppose that’s a sign of affection beyond that of a friend’s in itself,  that I want to monopolise her time and her person. But don’t friends  feel that about each other as well? I wonder…but what makes me happy  isn’t what I do. It’s that she lets me do it, she consents to that  possessiveness, and she even seems to enjoy it. At the very least,  she’s never made any serious protest, though she’s never said she likes  it, either. But this is Kaname, so that’s to be expected. I’ll have to  settle for her tacit consent. Now that’s the kind that’ll get you sued  and hung out to dry…</span></em> </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname hesitantly pulled back the curtain and stepped out again. “Are we done yet?” She winced. “Do you have to squeal?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I didn’t squeal.” <em>I’m  Momomi. I don’t do squealing. I’m not an Etoile fangirl, who make  ecstatic noises and swoon whenever they pass by and pay ridiculous  amounts of money for photos and fanbooks of dubious legality. That was  a noise that denotes my enthusiastic approval and a healthy  appreciation of my work. It was definitely not a squeal.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That was a godamn squeal. No point in lying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you say so,” Momomi said diplomatically. <em>Not important right now. I need to enjoy this sight while I still can. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  was dressed in jeans, a long-sleeved blue shirt that was tight around  her and an unzipped black jacket. The top two buttons of the shirt were  open and she hadn’t bothered to tuck in her shirt either. “Well?” she  asked, slightly awkwardly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi closed the gap, tucking her  shirt in on the left side but leaving it out on the right. “There. I  love it. Casual chic, it’s pure you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What the hell is casual chic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  scratched her nose. “Well… that. You look like a male model. If they  had male models aged thirteen, but it scales well enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That word again,” Kaname growled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  smiled. “I’m just teasing you, you know, because I’ve worked out that  it’s easy to get a rise out of you that way. I never knew you had such  a retiring, feminine soul.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I am about three inches away from kicking you out of this store,” Kaname warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“My, my. You sound like the manager.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wouldn’t be as polite as him. Are we done now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For now, I suppose. We’re taking that set and the other three I picked out, the rest can go back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You make so much work out of this…” Kaname grumbled, going back to change into her old clothes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s good to be thorough,” Momomi retorted automatically. <em>Now this is what free time should be like. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  took a few minutes getting dressed again, while Momomi just tapped her  feet and waited for her to come out. Finally, Kaname emerged, flicking  a strand of her hair back into place. “Shall we go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi just nodded, helping her put all the clothes back. There was more for Kaname than there was for Momomi. <em>For  all her enthusiasm, she doesn’t quite know where to begin. Which suits  me just fine. Perhaps I’ll have to expand my wardrobe later to match  but in the meantime I have only one day to enjoy. I’m going to pack it  from left to right with Kaname. </em>When they were done, Momomi paid  for everything that had elected to buy, ignoring Kaname’s slight wince  at the extortionate prices. <em>All mother’s money, which is to say all  father’s money. It’s best to exorcise it by spending it on Kaname and  myself without any sense of responsibility. </em>“Okay,” Momomi said, smiling and handing one of the bags over. “Now get changed. Wear the first outfit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  look too confused. Now that we have all these nice clothes, there’s no  way I’m going to let you stay in those old ones. Come on, I’m getting  changed as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m getting sick of this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  grabbed Kaname’s hand and dragged her back to the changing rooms again.  “We can cut the tags off later, but we’ll just have to wear them as-is  for now. Hurry up.” She pushed Kaname into the changing rooms with more  force than was strictly necessary, then stepped into the second  herself, quickly discarding her old clothes and too-short skirt. She  dressed in one of her new purchases, white leggings, a knee-length  black skirt and a white turtleneck sweater. <em>The female clothing.  And Kaname, of course, wears trousers. Luckily that’s her preference,  but I’d force her into it anyway. We make a good couple. Actually, we  could probably pass for a bona fide heterosexual couple with an effete  male provided no one looks too closely…anywhere but here. Considering  this town is under Astraea’s aegis, it probably has our number. As if  our relationship actually was like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She stepped out and  waited briefly for Kaname, who was always slower, dressed in jeans, a  lilac shirt and a comfortable dark-blue hoody. “You know, as much as I  despise that style in principle, it does suit you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And I hate  skirts, but they look good on you,” Kaname said. “The art of fashion is  forcing people into things they wear for other people, not themselves.  I’m glad I’m the one who gets to wear the practical clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  I find it a lot more comfortable to dress like this,” Momomi replied  evenly. “Probably because I’m used to it, and I’ve never really worn  trousers. It probably just comes down to experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Somehow I feel skirts wouldn’t suit me even if I’d worn them all my life,” Kaname mused. “Somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah, but if you had worn them all your life, you’d have longer hair and would generally look more like a girl,” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That again… I can’t imagine the inconvenience of longer hair. I’ve no idea how you cope, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, I’m not suggesting it,” Momomi said, waving her hands. “You look better like this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Like shorter hair. But that doesn’t mean I’m not going to tease you about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  sighed. “I’ve been way too indulgent just because this is your special  celebration, but I think I’m going to have to retaliate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll  be waiting for you to assert your masculine authority, then.” Momomi  caught her hand and dragged her towards the entrance. “Come on, let’s  go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What now?” Kaname asked wearily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi frowned.  “Let’s see… I definitely want to get you at least three scarves, some  for me as well, but they didn’t have any good ones… we need new shoes  as well… and I want to go around all the other clothes stores and see  if they have any other good things that one didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So this is the fabled female shopping spree…” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You shouldn’t speak as if you aren’t involved, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I don’t give a damn about this stuff. I’m just being dragged around by you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  you want me to call you a woman,” Momomi said, huffing righteously.  “But in the first instance, we need to eat lunch. I’m getting hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now that’s a plan I can get behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “Want to go to the same place as before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  rolled her eyes. “And spent another half hour discussing sensitive  topics under the ears of a bored man? I’d really rather not. Can’t we  go somewhere with a little more energy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You just can’t  appreciate small-town time when you see it,” Momomi chided. “Back in  Italy, I had to go thirty miles to reach the first town big enough to  support a restaurant, when we were at our country villa. The city house  was close to nothing but obnoxious chain restaurants..”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m not sure you suffered from that,” Kaname said pointedly. “You could eat a four-course meal every day anyway, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Every  meal of every day, actually.” Momomi sighed. “Actually, that’s less fun  than it sounds. Even good food gets old, until you start to appreciate  bad food for all its little qualities. That goes for anything you have  too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sounds bizarre.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi shrugged. “Or it could just be me, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname nodded. “I suspect that’s just you. You have this obsession with being poor, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I do not have an obsession with being poor! Being independent is not the same thing as being poor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And how about that time you wandered here and there and nearly got kidnapped?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That was different!” Momomi protested. “I was young and stupid!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  it’s not like I blame you or anything,” Kaname said. “Other people’s  experiences always appear to be more interesting than your own. That’s  probably one of the reasons why I came to this school, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi gave her a cunning look. “Could it be that Kaname’s a closet aristocrat fetishist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Hardly. Hatred at worst. Morbid fascination at best. And above all, a desire to equal and exceed them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m sure you wouldn’t aim to overcome something you didn’t give a damn about,” Momomi pointed out. “Amane, for example.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  do not give a damn about Amane!” Kaname snapped. “Amane is the worst  kind of feckless little pinhead with no apprehension of her own luck.  That’s why I’m determined to beat her, so I can beat into the her the  fact that not everyone’s so damn spoilt by fate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You mean her intellect, physical fitness, handsome good looks and all-around perfection?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname gave her an unpleasant glare. “Don’t start sounding like one of her many stupid fangirls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“No.  What I was going to say is those are all qualities you share with her.  Not particularly from hard work, either, you were born with them.  You’re lucky, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah, so I have talent. That’s not the  point.” Kaname stuck her free hand in her pocket, but kept the other  one out, holding Momomi’s. “Amane doesn’t need to be talented. She  could be a babbling idiot and she’d still live a better life than  ninety-five percent of the population.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And you hate her for that?” Momomi asked quietly. “That goes for me as well, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  not that exactly,” Kaname said slowly. “It’s more like… her attitude.  She acts like she doesn’t care about anything or anyone. I’ve never  seen her make a friend or take any interest in her array of talents and  fans. She spares most of her affection for her horse. It’s so… godamn,  stupidly pointless! She has that life, I have my life, and she doesn’t  enjoy it! What I’d do in her position-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What would you do in her  position?” Momomi asked quietly. “What is there to do in her position?  You said yourself, she could be anyone and still live a fine life. She  has nothing to work for and nothing to prove.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “Sure, so she doesn’t have to do anything… what a horrible life. I’m crying, I really am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s  not that. I’m not saying she suffers,” Momomi said. “But she doesn’t  have any reason to care. She was born to a role, she’ll fulfil it, her  husband will be selected for her and she will marry. That’s all. She  has incredible talents and no need to put them to use. No, there’s no  point in her doing so. In a sense, there’s no point in her life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  that doesn’t excuse anything.” Kaname gave her an annoyed look. “If she  has no purpose, she should find one. She shouldn’t just sit around and  take everything for granted. She should do something, anything, she  should live. Purpose isn’t thrust on you by the heavens! You’re  supposed to find your own goals and meaning, and she doesn’t. Even  though she could do anything, she does nothing at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What do  you do, know you’re here?” Momomi asked. “What did you do for the long  year and a half that preceded my father’s intervention in my life? Did  you throw yourself into anything? Did you get make any friends or get  stuck into anything at all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I didn’t, but that’s not the same,”  Kaname said. “I never belonged here and I wasn’t very stable to begin  with. Besides, no one would care even if I excelled. My mother wouldn’t  give a damn, and the other students wouldn’t either. Amane has a bloody  fanclub.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you actually tried, I’m sure people would pay  attention. At the very least, because you haven’t tried, you can’t say  people wouldn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname gave her friend an annoyed look. “Why are you defending her anyway? It’s annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because  I know what she must feel. Just a little.” Momomi closed her eyes for a  moment. “A peripheral cousin of the main Ohtori family. The second  daughter of the Phareli. We’re property to be auctioned off at the  proper age, that’s all. I spent half my life struggling with that, the  shadow of my sister, the fact that my pretty, well-educated, expensive  life had no purpose at all… and you drift. Just like you did. You  simply continue to exist, no more and no less.” She looked directly at  Kaname. “I was saved from that by you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname gave her a surprised look. “You were? News to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thanks  to you, I found a reason to struggle when my father tried to drag me  back. You gave me something important to me, a way in which I could be  hurt, and so you gave me something to defend. You’re my purpose.”  Momomi looked away. “Amane doesn’t have anyone like that. Perhaps she  will one day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You make her sound like some kind of martyr,”  Kaname muttered, rubbing her head in embarrassment. Using the hand that  she’d thrust into her pockets.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s nothing that dramatic,”  Momomi said steadily. “But as you do have an interest in Amane, and I  know you do, I thought I’d give my opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re as theatrical as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, that’s a long way from our conversation on the relative  merits of restaurants,” Momomi reflected. “How did we get to Amane  anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I forget. You always drag us off on tangents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I do? You’re the one who raised my family meals!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you’re the one who talked about Amane, and you know I have far too much to say about her. Don’t blame me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just because I made one casual comment, you didn’t have to go on a huge tirade!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Just  because I aired my usual grievances, you didn’t have to keep arguing  back,” Kaname replied. “It made you sound like one of her fangirls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you’re the one who’s being immature by… wait.” Momomi put a hand over her eyes. “Restaurants. Restaurants, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “Restaurants. A busier one, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “Okay. We’ll look around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They were still holding hands. Momomi resisted the temptation to squeeze; she was being incriminating enough as it was. <em>It  does feel good, and I can pretend this is all part of the betting game.  But more than that, I’m letting my feelings show, just a little. And  while I was seriously worried about that before, I’ve decided. If I  don’t tell her at some point in the very near future I will burst like  an overblown balloon. That’s what I am, really, too full of pent-up  emotions and mental confusion to tolerate continuing in this way. It’s  no longer even a matter of getting with her or not getting with her, I  just have to settle this. One way or the other. But this is Kaname I’m  talking about, the self-professed emotional cripple. On top of that  she’s either oblivious or in denial about my feelings. I can’t just  drop it on her, she’ll need a twenty-meter running start and a triple  jump before she’ll even understand the question. So if I hint at it in  little ways like this, step by step, flirty comments and casual touches  and everything else, perhaps she’ll begin to get the idea. And then  she’ll freak out inside and then she’ll angst and then she’ll double  and triple and quadruple check her logic to make sure she understands  the situation, and then, finally, after everything else, she’ll  actually consider her own feelings, the answer she has to give. I know  this because I experienced the same thing myself, starting when I saw  her get out of the shower a few days ago. And through all this painful  thinking she won’t say a word to me, to protect her pride, just in case  she’s wrong and her suspicions were weird. Of course, I’m the weird  one. And then I’ll tell her and she’ll be able to reply and that will  be that. </em>Momomi bit her lip. <em>Sounds wonderful. So why does it feel like I’m just stalling to give myself time?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Then Kaname squeezed her hand. “Momomi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She stared at her friend, then followed her gaze and stopped dead. She released Kaname’s hand quickly. <em>If I hadn’t, she would have done so herself, even if it pains me to admit that. </em>“We should go back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname put a hand on her shoulder. “No. You should go say goodbye.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Since when did you run away?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s  easy for you to say,” Momomi began, but it was too late. Araldo had  spotted them, waving obliviously, and then the family turned as one and  saw them. Momomi forced herself to wave back, walking uneasily towards  them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They were in front of the station; clearly, Rodrigo had  unbent enough to take the common train out of this very isolated part  of the country. Of course, he’d still rented a car and found two  manservants from somewhere to do the actual heavy lifting. He appeared  to be so busy complaining to them that he hadn’t noticed Momomi.  Seconds after she formed that thought she realised that wasn’t it. He’d  simply decided to ignore her for now. <em>Very mature, father. </em>“So, you’re all off,” she managed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Luigia  gave her a suspicious look, glancing between her and Kaname in a  slightly worrying fashion, then abruptly relaxed and smiled. “We’re  off. You look good, Momomi. Are those new clothes? I don’t remember  sending them to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo grunted and threw Yukaho a dirty look before looking away again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes,  that’s right. I just brought them so I thought I’d try them out,”  Momomi said. “The Etoiles gave us a day off, for once, so I thought I’d  so some clothes shopping.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Luigia nodded. “Don’t they let you out on weekends?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  they do, but I don’t go then.” Momomi shifted slightly on the balls of  her feet. “Clubs and things, you know? Besides, it’s a funny thing, but  scheduled free time is somehow less exciting than exceptional free  time. If you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In any case, you look lovely, darling,” Yukaho said. “And your friend, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Thanks.” Momomi gave her a blank, innocent look. <em>When  we saw each other last, the things she said and the things I said,  especially those things I said…I’m amazed she still considers me a  daughter. Perhaps she got by in denial, pretending I hadn’t said  anything at all. I don’t know. I don’t care.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t know  anything about this stuff, so I’m in your daughter’s hands,” Kaname  said, her voice slightly rough. “I owe her, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m glad she’s finally taking an interest in her appearance,” Luigia replied, smiling. “When she was younger I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Momomi.” Rodrigo turned around and everything stopped. He still had that effect on people. “Why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I- well,” Momomi found herself getting tongue-tied despite herself. <em>Damn him and his bloody, hopeless, unchanging, irredeemable- </em>she saw a flash of the Rodrigo in the forest, and felt thoroughly displaced. <em>Who is he? What kind of man is my father? </em>“I came to say goodbye. That’s perfectly natural, isn’t it? More than that, isn’t it my duty-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  told you.” Rodrigo glared at her. “I didn’t want to see you again. I  don’t want to see you know. Come back to me in five years when you’re  actually mature enough to know who you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s precisely because I know who I am that you don’t want to see me,” Momomi muttered, glowering back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  you can still say that with a straight face and that impudent tone, get  out of my sight. I’ve no interest in such a daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Dear, do we have to part like this?” Yukaho beseeched. “It’s so unpleasant…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Have  you forgotten the things she said?” Rodrigo asked acidly. “I haven’t  forgotten, myself. And I certainly haven’t forgiven. Until such time as  she’s an adult, I have no second daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Until such time as you sell me off, you mean,” Momomi snapped, with nothing much to lose.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If  I bother to do that much, you should be grateful,” Rodrigo warned. “But  don’t even count on that, it’s more than a disgrace like you deserves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’d suit me just fine if I disappeared here forever, and never had to see you again,” Momomi retorted angrily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Momomi, don’t say that,” Luigia began. “We’re still family-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t interrupt, Luigia,” Rodrigo ordered. “I want to hear every word this louse of a girl has to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  was about to retort angrily when Kaname placed a hand on her shoulder.  She shook her head slightly. Momomi deflated and took a step back; to  her intense surprise, Kaname took a step forwards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">To Momomi’s  even more intense surprise she pulled her fist back and hit Rodrigo  square on the nose, as hard as she could. “If you’ve got anything to  say, say it to me, you inbred bastard. Unlike Momomi, I could care less  about whatever crap you’re talking about, and I care less about you.”  Kaname drew herself up. “That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">The family had gone into a  state of shock. Rodrigo just clutched his nose with one hand and stared  in wordless, incoherent rage, then drew his hand back to hit back.  Momomi just closed her eyes and prayed to a probably non-existent God  to kill her there and now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Humph.” When Momomi looked again  Rodrigo was staring at Kaname, as if taking her apart with his eyes.  “And why would a teenage brat take it upon herself to assault me, of  all people? You have a lot of guts to pull that and stand here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi stared. She may have made a small, surprised noise. <em>Did I miss something here?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll  protect Momomi. That’s all. There’s nothing more to be said.” Kaname’s  tone was clear, clipped and impassive, her face completely calm, her  arms folded but in a more relaxed way than usual.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Rodrigo  snorted, long and hard, then shrugged and turned away. “Do what you  like. It’s not like she’s redeemable, no matter what company she keeps.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname nodded and turned away, grabbing Momomi’s hand. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Good-bye,”  Momomi sad weakly. The rest of the family looked faint, which wasn’t  very surprising, so no clear reply was forthcoming. She settled for  walking after Kaname.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">By exerting superhuman restraint, she  managed to avoid asking questions until they were well out of earshot.  But after she stared openly at Kaname for several seconds, who didn’t  even turn to acknowledge her, something snapped. “What the hell was  that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t give me that!” Momomi snapped. “What the hell was… well… everything!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Didn’t you remember?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Remember what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A long time ago, you promised me you’d slap my mother. And I said I’d punch your father. I don’t do your ladylike slap thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  followed through with that? Are you crazy?” Momomi walked faster,  trying to face her. “You’re insane! He was about this far from  completely losing it! And he can punch, he really can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“He didn’t, though, did he?” Kaname pointed out. “So it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  yes, but that’s not the point. It was still far too dangerous! Why did  you do that anyway?” Momomi gave her a strange look. “Not even you’d do  something like that based on such a stupid reason, so don’t try the  same excuse twice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“To protect you,” Kaname replied. “That’s  simple enough, isn’t it? Besides, I’d do it a thousand times over if I  could. He deserves worse, because he made you suffer and cry. Perhaps  you’re kind, Momomi, but I haven’t forgiven him and I’m not afraid of  him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you should be! He’s strong and short-tempered and don’t forget, powerful!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly.”  Kaname gritted her teeth. “Bastards like him think they can say what  they like because of who they are! Well, I don’t give a damn! I won’t  let anyone talk to you that way, so if you’re pressuring me, that’s  why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you want to suffer to protect me?” Momomi replied. “Very idealistic, but no-one asked me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You don’t come into it. I’ll do what I please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So this is a martyr’s self-satisfaction to you, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  folded her arms. “My satisfaction is derived from the fact that it  stopped there. You’re not hurt. Perhaps you wouldn’t understand those  feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re the one who doesn’t understand!” Momomi gave her a frustrated glare. “It was my family! My business!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If someone hurts you, I’ll make it my business. I don’t care what you say. It’s for me, not you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, think about yourself sometimes! You could have been hurt!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Who cares if I get hurt?” Kaname asked. “I know I don’t. It’s not unusual-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  care.” Momomi snorted. “So stop being stupid. No one should be  sacrificing themselves just for this. We should live life so neither of  us gets hurt. That’s what makes the most sense, right? And what hurts  you, hurts me, so stop thinking you can protect me at your own expense!  It’s a very male attitude, and it’s annoying!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname just sighed. “You’re as forthright as ever. I guess there was no need for me to worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  decided to accept this for the peace offering it probably was. “And  what was with that, anyway? He should have crucified you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Bastards know bastards. It’s in the eyes.” Kaname shrugged. “If you ask me, he decided I wasn’t worth hitting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Have  you any idea what my father’s like?” Momomi demanded. “I thought you  knew, he’s as arrogant as the pharaohs and as short-tempered as the  vikings!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well? So am I.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then surely you should kill each other before coexisting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  snorted. “Well, even if I’m me, I’m a thirteen year-old Catholic  schoolgirl. Beating me up would be a waste of effort. I’m not his  daughter, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi winced at the inference. “I thought we’d settled that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  explains your high pain tolerance,” Kaname reflected. “It also explains  why I wanted to beat him to death with a chair from the first moment I  set eyes in him. Instincts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s in the past. Mostly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Mostly.”  Kaname growled to herself. “This is why I’m furious, but not for the  same reasons as you. I know I didn’t go far enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi took her arm. “It’s okay, you went far enough for me. And I am kind of glad that you stood up for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed theatrically, though her lips were twitching into a smile. “Well, just as long as you understand,” she managed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“In  any case, this is a completed matter,” Momomi declared. “I’m still  going to have a good day, and I’m going to forget all about that.” <em>As If I’m going to be able to forget Kaname assaulting my father.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname shrugged. “Suits me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So  now we can have a decent lunch,” Momomi declared. “I’m hungry as well.  And then after that, we’ve still got a lot of shopping to do. Scarves,  shoes, more clothes… anything else we need? Hmm, I might look in some  bookstores, see if there’s anything good. Astraea’s library’s a little  on the old side, to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More romances?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More romances. Anything wrong with that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not how I’d spend my time, but whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You should be more romantic, Kaname,” Momomi teased. “It would make you a lot more interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not sure I want to be more interesting in that sense,” Kaname replied. “It’s all pretty silly, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So you don’t believe in finding happiness with someone else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t have to believe in it. I know it happens. But it’s not a certain,  ideal, or perfect thing.” Kaname shrugged. “In a book or a film, the  outcome is all but assured. They’ll stretch things out with drama and  angst and misunderstanding, but on some level we all know that there  will be a happy ending. People aren’t that convenient. For too many  people, there’s not going to be a happy ending, or things will work out  after the so-called end that hurt them even more. Adultery. Divorce.  Domestic violence. Life isn’t anything like the books, in short.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  say that, but the charm of those books is precisely because life isn’t  anything like them,” Momomi pointed out. “It’s not like I’m not aware  of that. It’s a wish fantasy, just like the actual genre fantasy, just  like science fiction, crime and everything else. Can’t you let people  dream from time to time?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, dreaming is fine, provided you can remember reality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“For  a lot of people, reality’s hard to forget,” Momomi said sadly. “If they  could dream a little more and have a little more courage, they might  have more happy endings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But there’d also be more sad ones.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked up a the sky. She didn’t think she could face the ground. “That’s true. But.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  people still have to believe in their happy ending. Even if it’s  against the odds, hope against hope, a pointless thing… they have to  believe to have a purpose in life.” Momomi watched the clouds for a  moment. “That’s the only way we can live.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname glanced at her. “You’re right, I suppose. It’s not like I’m any different.”</span></p>
