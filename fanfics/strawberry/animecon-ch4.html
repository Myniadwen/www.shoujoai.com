<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 4 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ninemil.html">ninemil</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Kagome&#39;s green eyes swam with bottomless depth as they watched Chiyo on 
her way back to the fourth year corridor&#39;s cleaning cupboard.

The Lulim underclassman stood to one side of the open door, her arms 
wrapped around the soft brown teddy bear she carried with her at all 
times, waiting quietly for Chiyo to finish before the pair went to the 
library together. Chiyo was lugging behind her the huge antique vacuum 
cleaner made available for the girl&#39;s use when cleaning their rooms, her 
apron smudged with dirty marks and what appeared to be tea stains. She 
was exhausted, a disgruntled look on her face as she tugged the heavy 
metal cylinder the final few steps to the cupboard, muttering to herself 
with each step.

With dramatic effort, she shoved the vacuum cleaner into the cupboard, 
dumping the hose and nozzle on the floor next to it, giving the cylinder 
a firm boot for good measure. Satisfied, she then slammed the cupboard 
door for effect before flopping back against it to catch her breath.

Distinctly hard work today Chiyo noted to herself.

&quot;Is Chiyo-chan okay?&quot; Kagome asked in her usual sullen tone.

The tiny Miatorian looked vexed, and rambled as she brushed herself 
down,

&quot;Oh, as well as anyone can be when they&#39;re being slave driven by the 
upperclassmen.&quot; Disgruntled at her filthy apron, she undid its ties 
before holding the white cotton up to inspect. It was disgustingly 
dirty, a fact which enraged the first year even further.

&quot;And look! Another apron to wash! I&#39;ll spend my entire evening in the 
wash room at this rate while everyone else is having fun.&quot;

She sighed, looking downcast as she screwed the apron up into a ball, 
stuffing it into her pocket.

Kagome waited quietly for Chiyo to finish adjusting herself, and then 
the pair started off down the corridor together.

&quot;Ohshibaru thought Chiyo-chan enjoyed being room temp for Nagisa-sama?&quot; 
Kagome asked in her eerily detached form of third person.

Chiyo huffed and muttered something under her breath.

&quot;Sorry, Ohshibaru didn&#39;t hear what Chiyo-chan said.&quot;

Chiyo pouted at the stuffed bear, then replied,

&quot;Nothing. And yes, I do love making my onee-sama happy. Very much so,&quot; 
she scratched the back of her neck as she continued, &quot;And it&#39;s my duty. 
And Tamao-chan is a good tutor also so I&#39;m very lucky. I just had a lot 
to clean up today, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Reaching the stair well, they trotted down towards the main entrance 
hall.

&quot;But Ohshibaru thought being a room temp was hard work all the time?&quot; 
Kagome asked, &quot;All that cleaning...&quot;

&quot;Worse when you&#39;re cleaning up after someone that shouldn&#39;t be there,&quot; 
Chiyo muttered, green with envy. Realising her error, she then blushed 
as it dawned on her she&#39;d said it out loud rather than in her head as 
she&#39;d intended.

Kagome looked confused.

&quot;Eh, um...never mind, okay.&quot; Chiyo muttered, looking away in frustration 
and embarrassment.

Turning the corner at the bottom of the stair well, the girls went to 
leave the building, Chiyo holding the door for Kagome as she stepped out 
into the frigid air. It had been snowing again, and a fine layer of 
white fluff had settled across the grounds, the paths between buildings 
only visible by the many imprinted footsteps that criss-crossed them.

&quot;But Nagisa-chan and Tamao-chan share a room? Why wouldn&#39;t they be 
allowed there?&quot; Kagome asked, confused.

Chiyo snapped,

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter okay? Forget I said anything.&quot;

Kagome stopped in the middle of the path and looked at Chiyo as she 
continued walking. After a moment, the Miatorian also paused, looking 
back to face the tiny Lulim girl.

&quot;Does Chiyo-chan have a secret she can&#39;t tell Ohshibaru?&quot;

Kagome actually sounded hurt.

Chiyo looked at Kagome, then again at the demented looking bear. 
Huffing, she turned around, marching off towards the library. Confused 
by the whole conversation, Kagome grasped Percival tightly as she ran to 
catch up.

- - - - -

With Yaya much more attentive, friday&#39;s lessons had proven to be 
infinitely less stressful for the young Spican Etoile, the endless 
stream of questions easier to cope with knowing there was someone close 
by to whisper the answer in her ear or give her a helping nudge, and 
Yaya&#39;s intimidating glare was more than capable of silencing the 
previously vocal critics of Hikari&#39;s new position when it became 
necessary.

Yaya had made sure she was there to walk Hikari to class in the morning, 
with her at recess and lunch, despite a sulking Tsubomi playing 
piggy-in-the-middle, and had even walked her to the cathedral for 
practice that evening, despite being adamant she wasn&#39;t going to attend 
herself. Disappointed that Yaya had chosen not to sing with the choir 
that night, but thankful for the day&#39;s company all the same, Hikari bid 
the dark haired third year farewell before entering the vaulted wooden 
door to the stone building. Watching Hikari disappear along the lush red 
carpet towards the organ and the rest of the Saintly Chorus, Yaya slunk 
back from the entrance and headed off towards the library.

As she walked, tiny flakes of snow began to fall, announcing a drop in 
temperate as the evening sun began its slow journey into the horizon and 
a good night&#39;s rest. Yaya shivered and turned the collar on her white 
blazer up, pulling her long hair forward, trying to shelter herself from 
the bitter wind.

Usually she loved winter, but this year it was just more hassle; another 
distraction to add to her growing collection.

She looked towards the library ahead of her, the most recent addition to 
that catalogue waited for her within.

&#39;Yes, I am an idiot. I just want to stay here.&#39;

Tsubomi&#39;s words from the day of the election ceremony came back to her, 
a wry smile passing Yaya&#39;s lips as she walked. She&#39;d kicked herself that 
afternoon, unable to believe she&#39;d been so blind. With Hikari busy at 
the ceremony, the two girls had sat in silence after Tsubomi&#39;s subtle 
admission; Yaya left speechless by the unexpected change of character, 
dealing with the mixture of emotions regarding her room mate but 
intrigued and unnerved by Tsubomi&#39;s insistent desire to stay with her, 
the flustered first year perched a world away at the other end of the 
bed. Completely out of the blue for the usually brash Tsubomi, the 
underlying sentiment had been wrapped in subtext and for a long time 
after they&#39;d been left alone, Yaya had struggled with the idea that 
she&#39;d read the meaning right.

In fact, it wasn&#39;t until she&#39;d started getting changed into her Chorus 
gown so she could attend the presentation ceremony that Yaya had real 
reason to act on Tsubomi&#39;s words in her usual, clumsy style. Catching 
the blushing first year&#39;s gaze working across her body as she undressed, 
Yaya had instinctively pounced, throwing thoughts of the blonde 
Etoile-to-be to the wind. Yaya had never been one for elegant 
declarations and meaningful looks; she always struggled to get the words 
out right, and besides, she&#39;d yet to find anything you couldn&#39;t say 
quicker with a kiss.

Which is exactly what she&#39;d done. Pinning the strawberry haired first 
year to the bed she&#39;d made sure Tsubomi knew damn well she had her 
undivided attention.

Amusingly, she found the younger Spican could be just as forceful in her 
actions as she was with her words, her loud nature reflecting in all 
sides of her character. Similar to Yaya, the rash behaviour tended to be 
dominant only when embarrassment or frustration became an issue, but 
Yaya could live with that. At least she knew where Tsubomi was coming 
from.

Looking back fondly, that had been an eventful night indeed, not just 
for those winning the election or eloping together mid-ceremony to the 
lake. In the days following, the previous months of angst and sorrow 
rooted in Hikari&#39;s obsession with Amane had melted away, forgotten as 
Yaya and Tsubomi worked off their mountain of repressed emotions and 
sexual frustration, Tsubomi as eager and willing as Yaya to go anywhere 
their young imaginations led them.

In a warped sense of irony, their relative immaturity had probably been 
their release, making it so much easier to let everything else around 
them slide. But that had had it&#39;s consequences it seemed.

The thoughtful smile left Yaya&#39;s lips as she strode her way through the 
snow, long legs covered in goose bumps from the cold. She kicked herself 
for leaving her thigh-high&#39;s at the Dorm. Reaching the library doors, 
she paused for a moment, taking in the gothic stonework and huge wooden 
door.

As fun as it had all been so far, the previous day had proven to Yaya it 
was time to take things a little more seriously; a little more 
responsibly perhaps, and with a heavy sigh she pushed the door open, 
readying herself for what could well be an interesting discussion. Two 
people who were both practically incapable of vocalising their emotions 
without groping each other or shouting, trying to have an adult 
conversation about their relationship and the effect it might be having 
on other people.

Yaya grimaced with the comedy of it.

Stepping into the low light of the library, she walked the aisles on the 
way to their usual meeting point. Passing row after row of tall 
bookshelves, she noted with a cynical grin the extremely unsubtle 
couples huddled together, pretending to read the same book or hold some 
form of debate. There would be only one topic being covered in this 
place on a friday night, Yaya knew, and you wouldn&#39;t find it referenced 
in the children&#39;s section that was for sure.

Reaching one of the quiet study rooms at the back of the main hall, Yaya 
smiled at the poorly forged sign pinned on the door, claiming the room 
was off limits for refurbishment. She took a deep breath before turning 
the brass handle and peering into the room ahead.

It was pitch black, somewhat expected given the person she was meeting.

&quot;Tsubomi-chan?&quot; She called, sliding through the door and closing it 
quietly behind her.

She felt something brush her shoulder as she walked into what should 
have been the centre of the room, waiting for the inevitable with wry 
amusement.

&quot;Tsubomi-chan, I know you&#39;re there.&quot;

A soft giggle echoed from the corner of the room, and Tsubomi whispered 
back,

&quot;Are you alone Yaya?&quot;

Tsubomi rolled her eyes, replying,

&quot;No, given what you said the other night, I thought I&#39;d bring Kizuna and 
Remon along for company. What do you think?&quot;

Tsubomi giggled again, and Yaya felt something press against her back. 
Playful fingers ran up her thighs before taking her hands and gently 
placing them on Tsubomi&#39;s waist.

Puzzled, Yaya ran her fingers over the soft, embroidered fabric covering 
Tsubomi&#39;s skin.

&quot;Silk?&quot; Yaya asked.

Tsubomi giggled again, and Yaya felt hot breath in her ear.

&quot;Better. I thought at least one of us should make an effort tonight.&quot;

Yaya blanched, the spark of arousal bringing a flush to her cheeks and 
warmth to her skin.

She hadn&#39;t intended for the evening to progress this way; well, at least 
not so quickly.

&quot;Tsubomi, I wanted to talk to you about something.&quot;

Tsubomi was circling her, holding Yaya&#39;s hand as she ran it across her 
semi-naked body. Whatever the younger girl was wearing, it certainly 
wasn&#39;t covering much, and was very lacy indeed.

Yaya struggled to keep her mind on business, and took Tsubomi firmly by 
the wrists.

&quot;Well if you&#39;re not wanting to wait...&quot; Tsubomi teased.

Yaya snapped off-handily,

&quot;Think with something higher than your navel for a second.&quot;

Tsubomi flounced in the dark, her posture taking on an annoyed tone.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d like it?&quot; She said, sounding hurt, embarrassed at 
having made the effort without receiving the desired response.

Yaya tried to paper the cracks,

&quot;I do Tsubomi. Really I do. I just...&quot; she knew the topic at hand wasn&#39;t 
going to be popular, and braced herself for the reaction, especially 
given the effort the underclassman had gone to for the evening. 
&quot;...there&#39;s something I need to talk to you about.&quot;

Tsubomi shifted her weight, presumably standing hands on hips in the 
darkness.

&quot;Well?&quot;

Yaya bit her lip, then mumbled,

&quot;It was about Hikari.&quot;

Tsubomi huffed, pulling her arm away from Yaya before striding across 
the room and flicking the light switch.

Blinded for a second, Yaya looked with disappointment as she found 
Tsubomi had already pulled her long white Spican overcoat around her 
before Yaya had had the chance to see what all the fuss was about. 
Noting the glance, Tsubomi snapped,

&quot;Too late, you had your chance.&quot; Perching on the edge of the wooden 
reading desk that ran the length of the study room back wall, she 
remarked, &quot;so what about wonder girl? What&#39;s she done now?&quot;

Yaya sighed, sensing the agitation in Tsubomi&#39;s voice.

&quot;It&#39;s not what she&#39;s done. It&#39;s more what we&#39;re doing.&quot;

Tsubomi rolled her eyes,

&quot;Sorry, is there a problem with what we&#39;re doing? You&#39;ve not complained 
so far,&quot; she remarked. Then with a sly grin, &quot;Is there something you&#39;d 
like me to do differently?&quot;

Yaya glared, her temper bubbling over.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to be serious.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and it&#39;s dull! I couldn&#39;t care less about Hikari Yaya; I could 
have you undressed by now. I had feathers and a neckla - &quot;

&quot;Tsubomi!&quot; Yaya snapped.

&quot;What!&quot; Tsubomi shouted back in frustration, the emotional cauldron 
bubbling over. &quot;Just get to the point already.&quot;

Yaya crossed her arms and leant back against the wall, her mood 
increasingly foul but her head telling her she needed to calm down. 
Measuring her words, she said,

&quot;I think we need to tell Hikari what&#39;s going on.&quot;

Tsubomi raised an eyebrow in indifference.

&quot;....because exactly? If she hasn&#39;t guessed already that is.&quot;

&quot;Because I&#39;m spending far too much time with you, and far too little 
time with her.&quot; Yaya replied, &quot;Whatever might be going on between us, 
she&#39;s still my room mate, and she&#39;s been in all of my classes since she 
joined Spica.&quot;

Tsubomi shook her head and looked away. Letting one of her high heeled 
shoes slip part way off her stocking clad foot, she toyed with it, 
twisting it back and forth on its heel.

&quot;She&#39;s with Amane now. Why does she need you all of a sudden? She didn&#39;t 
last week,&quot; adding, &quot;and if I remember correctly, that was something you 
were fine with too.&quot;

Yaya took a long breath, trying to calm her nerves.

&quot;Because she needs the support. Because people are saying things 
Tsubomi, laying into her for taking the Etoile with Amane.&quot;

Tsubomi looked up from the shoe, glaring at Yaya.

&quot;That was her choice remember? Or had you forgotten her dumping you for 
the lady-boy already?&quot;

Yaya sighed.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so mean to Amane-san, she&#39;s alright really.&quot; Yaya remarked, 
pushing her black hair back with both hands before fiddling with it 
nervously.

Tsubomi blanched,

&quot;I really can&#39;t believe you just said that.&quot;

Inwardly, Yaya totally agreed with the sentiment. She hated 
conversations like this, they were difficult to control and she was 
forever being backed into corners she wouldn&#39;t normally have fought. 
Struggling to keep on track, the frustration began gnawing at her.

&quot;I just think we need to be more up front with Hikari,&quot; adding as an 
after thought, &quot;And perhaps a little less full on.&quot;

Yaya looked at the floor as she muttered, &quot;I don&#39;t want to exclude her, 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

Tsubomi flounced and kicked her shoe in Yaya&#39;s direction, watching as it 
skidded to a halt next to the waste paper bin.

&quot;Rather you&#39;d like to keep her handy in case Amane is losing interest. 
You&#39;re not the only one that&#39;s noticed Hikari moping around like a lost 
puppy,&quot; her eyes flashed with anger. &quot;What is it; bored of me already? 
Am I not good enough now you&#39;ve had a taste?&quot; There was a genuine look 
of hurt in the green eyes glaring from underneath her strawberry fringe 
and she pouted as she sulked.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so silly,&quot; Yaya snapped, &quot;I&#39;ve been over Hikari for ages.&quot;

&quot;What, all of a week? Yeah that&#39;s a really long time Yaya. I feel so 
reassured.&quot;

For a moment there was silence, only the occasional conversation from 
the hall outside making its way into the room.

Gingerly, Yaya pushed away from the wall, kneeling to collect the 
discarded shoe from the floor. Standing, she sauntered over to the first 
year who stood hugging herself against the wooden table.

&quot;Tsubomi-chan, she&#39;s my friend, my best friend.&quot;

Kneeling before Tsubomi, she took the younger girl&#39;s calf in her hands, 
lifting Tsubomi&#39;s leg before slipping the shoe back into its rightful 
place. She looked up, trying to look as sincere as possible.

&quot;Surely you know the difference...&quot;

Standing, Yaya ran a finger along Tsubomi&#39;s slender forearm, tipping her 
head so she could make eye contact.

&quot;Then what does that make me?&quot; Tsubomi asked, looking back dejected.

Yaya smiled,

&quot;Something so much more...&quot;

Tsubomi looked away for a moment, turning to face the wall, her pride 
still stinging at the mention of Hikari&#39;s name. But as Yaya&#39;s fingers 
moved from her arm to the hand grasping her overcoat around her, trying 
to gently pry the fingers holding it loose, Tsubomi slowly looked back 
into the deep brown eyes regarding her fondly.

A coy grin passed her lips, and she leant forward, whispering into 
Yaya&#39;s ear,

&quot;Not until you turn the light back off,&quot; adding, &quot;and don&#39;t you dare 
mention her name again tonight, or you can go without.&quot;

And with that, the deep-and-meaningful ended; Yaya relieved they&#39;d 
achieved anything at all.

- - - - -

Nagisa woke with a start, the morning sun light flooding into the 
Dormitory as Tamao snapped the linen curtains open. Groggily rubbing her 
eyes, the red headed upperclassman sat up in her bed, looking around her 
in confusion.

&quot;You&#39;re all dressed already?&quot; she moaned.

Tamao, Shizuma, Amane and Hikari all sat in the room around her, the 
Spican pair propping up Tamao&#39;s desk while Shizuma sat on Tamao&#39;s bed, 
smiling at Nagisa with playful green eyes.

It was strange seeing the others out of uniform; Amane had predictably 
opted for jeans and a loose fitting beige shirt; less than exciting and 
neutral in every possible way. Along with a brown leather flying jacket 
complete with white fluffy collar, you could&#39;ve mistaken her for an 
eighties fighter-pilot. Similarly reserved, Hikari wore a comfy looking 
fleece and a skirt, her black pop socks disappearing into warm looking 
boots.

Looking delicious, it was Tamao that stood out the most, her flowing 
dark hair up in high bunches and her deep blue eyes set off by a 
matching halter-neck top and a soft grey wrap-around. Shizuma, clad in 
black trousers and an off-the-shoulder jumper, smouldered quietly 
opposite.

&quot;What gives?&quot; Nagisa asked meekly.

Tamao smiled,

&quot;Nagisa-chan is obviously over doing it at the moment. We&#39;ve had 
breakfast already, taken showers and gotten dressed, and you did nothing 
but snore as we got ready around her.&quot;

Nagisa blushed, glancing around at the others.

&quot;What time is it?&quot; she asked in a small voice.

&quot;Almost eleven,&quot; Shizuma said, looking at her stylish silver watch, &quot;and 
our train leaves at midday.&quot;

Nagisa blanched and sat bolt upright.

&quot;Huh! Why&#39;d you let me sleep then?&quot;

Shizuma laughed, but it was Tamao that answered for her,

&quot;Because even though Nagisa-chan has eloped with my evil arch rival, she 
still has the cutest of sleeping faces, and I thought everyone should be 
able to see it.&quot;

Shizuma grinned at Tamao and threw her own in for good measure,

&quot;The demented look of bliss as you drool across the pillow is most 
befitting.&quot;

Nagisa pouted, and shot the pair a hurt look.

&quot;I won&#39;t go if you two pick on me all day.&quot;

The others chuckled, and Shizuma stood, throwing a towel at Nagisa.

&quot;Hurry up and have a shower, before I set Tamao lose on you as a 
motivator.&quot;

- - - - -

It was icy cold as the girls reached the station, and despite the single 
car being crammed with commuters, they were more than happy for the 
warmth within. The ride itself was uneventful, and with so many people 
around, they felt unable to talk freely apart from the odd murmur into 
their partner&#39;s ear.

The atmosphere was almost awkward to start with, Tamao still feeling out 
of place and Amane obviously uncomfortable outside the confines of the 
school, with Hikari initially bolted to her like a limpet; a fact that 
drew the odd glance from the older passengers on the train.

It was Shizuma who was most at home, obviously in her element as they 
stepped off the train and into the city station. This close to 
Christmas, the streets were bustling with people, and the bright neon 
and blazing window displays drew their attention in every direction. 
Playing the hostess, Shizuma guided them through the crowded streets 
from shop to shop, brand to brand, making idle conversation and seeing 
that no one was left out.

As the afternoon passed, the girls relaxed more and more, splitting up 
to visit different shops, teasing each other openly and laughing at 
their assorted and sometimes very conflicting tastes. With Shizuma 
obviously making a concerted effort not to push Tamao to one side, the 
dark haired fourth year found herself able to open up, the discomfort of 
being around the couple buried under the ability to throw sarcastic 
comments and tease without fear of retribution. She even found herself 
warming to Shizuma to a degree, thankful to the former-Etoile for trying 
to make it easy on her.

Perhaps the gesture of letting Shizuma stay in their room would pay off 
in the long run. Surely she&#39;d adjust to Nagisa&#39;s relationship with the 
silver-haired upperclassman quicker if she were around them more. And 
Shizuma was making it obvious she wasn&#39;t going to get territorial.

Having spent the majority of the morning on their feet, the girls went 
looking for somewhere to recharge their batteries, their feet aching and 
Nagisa whining about her stomach as usual. Joking and giggling, the 
girls chatted over coffee as they sat in one of the smaller mall 
restaurants, trying to avoid the crowds as much as possible. Apart from 
Amane, who&#39;d spent most of the trip just browsing, each of the girls had 
managed to find themselves something or other, and were showing their 
purchases off to the group.

&quot;...and I thought these would be nice for my mother when she comes to 
see me in January.&quot; Nagisa finished, cracking open a smart looking flip 
case that held a delicately constructed set of earrings.

Shizuma brushed them with her finger, watching the entwined metals 
shimmer in the light. She nodded approvingly, then sat back in her 
chair.

&quot;Has everyone found a dress yet then?&quot; Shizuma asked.

Tamao nodded, lifting dark fabric part way out of one of her bags.

&quot;Oo, let us see Tamao-chan!&quot; Nagisa piped, but her room mate declined, 
shaking her head,

&quot;No, it&#39;s going to be a surprise.&quot; She said as she hugged the bag 
lovingly to her chest with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m really happy with it though.&quot;

Nagisa looked sullen and toyed with her half empty cup.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen a couple of things; but I can&#39;t make my mind up. And I think 
I&#39;ve probably spent too much already,&quot; she said, looking sullen as she 
finished.

Shizuma smiled and squeezed her girlfriend&#39;s hand.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that; let&#39;s take a look at them and if they&#39;re not 
completely appalling I&#39;m sure I can stretch to it.&quot;

Tamao laughed and added,

&quot;If...&quot;

Nagisa pouted again, giggling after.

&quot;I dunno, I think I&#39;ve surprised even myself this time.&quot;

The girls chuckled, and then Shizuma turned to Hikari, who shrugged 
meekly.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen something I really like, but I want to see what 
Amane-senpai&#39;s wearing first before deciding for sure.&quot;

Shizuma nodded, then grinned as Amane squirmed under everyone&#39;s 
collective gaze.

&quot;Well Amane?&quot;

The tall Spican shifted uncomfortably,

&quot;I&#39;ve not really seen anything - &quot;

Shizuma laughed.

&quot;Bullshit! You were hoping we&#39;d forgotten weren&#39;t you.&quot; The Miatorian 
grinned evilly, then offered, &quot;Let us pick a few for you and you can 
choose, how does that sound?&quot;

Amane blushed, frustrated and feeling like she was a first year again.

&quot;That would be appreciated I guess.&quot;

Shizuma beamed and rubbed her hands together eagerly.

&quot;Suggestions everyone? Where do we try first?&quot;

Remon looked over the edge of her glasses with a quizzical brow, 
considering the curled up form of Kagome Byakudan as she sat on the 
window sill, staring out of the first floor lounge window at the falling 
snow beyond, hugging Percival tightly as she muttered to him softly.

The Transformation Club had met as per usual, but with the snow coming 
down so heavily and everyone exhausted after the week of election 
excitement, Chikaru had opted for the club to spend the afternoon 
indoors, considering the dynamics of hot chocolate and an interesting 
assortment of cookies. Scientifically approaching their important 
research task, the girls had devoured the better part of an entire box 
whilst draining enough chocolate to sail an ocean liner. The resulting 
table of detailed information and observations that scrawled across the 
black board at the back of the room stood testament to their hard 
detective work.

Feeling collectively full and somewhat subdued, they&#39;d each wandered off 
across the room to do their own thing, Kizuna reading a hardback that 
rested in her lap, Chikaru sat at the front, a constant clicking noise 
filling the room as she knitted furiously, the oddly coloured fabric not 
giving away its final form.

Kizuna stretched up from her place sat cross-legged on the floor, 
tugging at Remon&#39;s sleeve for her to come and sit beside her, but Remon 
shrugged the other second year off, nodding toward the first year 
huddled in the corner. Kizuna turned, peering and realizing what Remon 
was getting at. She closed her book, picking herself up from the floor 
before wandering over to Kagome in curiosity as she sat alone.

&quot;Kagome-chan?&quot; she asked in a soft voice.

Kagome&#39;s hair had fallen across her face, and to Kizuna&#39;s surprise, she 
seemed to be crying, rocking herself back and forth as she held Percival 
dearly in her lap.

&quot;Kagome?&quot; Kizuna asked again, and the tiny first year turned to face 
her.

She was right, Kagome was crying, her big green eyes swollen with tears 
that trickled down her face.

&quot;Kagome-chan, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; the young girl asked, worry filling her 
voice. But Kagome failed to reply, instead shaking her head before 
turning back to the window, continuing her gentle rocking.

Kizuna wrapped the sullen brunette in her arms, using the sleeve of her 
Lulim uniform to wipe away the tears.

The soft clicking of Chikaru&#39;s knitting needles stopped, and Kizuna 
motioned to the school council President to come over. Setting her 
knitting to one side, Chikaru slid off her stool and glided over to the 
two girls gathered in the corner.

Running her fingers through the little one&#39;s hair, she knelt next to 
Kagome, whispering in her ear.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with Ohshibaru Kagome?&quot;

Kagome paused her rocking, and turned to face the pretty fifth year&#39;s 
gentle gaze.

&quot;Ohshibaru is very sad.&quot; She stated, &quot;Chiyo-chan doesn&#39;t like him.&quot;

Chikaru leaned back, a look of surprise on her face.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound at all like Chiyo-chan Kagome? What made Ohshibaru 
think that?&quot;

Kagome looked at the fluffy bear in her arms, stroking the teddy&#39;s head 
lovingly.

&quot;Chiyo won&#39;t tell Ohshibaru her secret. She doesn&#39;t trust Ohshibaru.&quot;

Chikaru smiled fondly, explaining,

&quot;But secrets are meant to be kept Kagome, Ohshibaru should know that.&quot;

Kagome shook her head, adamant,

&quot;But it&#39;s a bad secret.&quot;

Chikaru and Kizuna exchanged glances.

&quot;A bad secret Kagome-chan?&quot;

Kagome nodded and softly said,

&quot;It&#39;s about Nagisa-sama and Tamao-sama, but Ohshibaru doesn&#39;t know 
what.&quot;

Attempting to console the underclassman further, Chikaru&#39;s eyes twinkled 
with intrigue and concern.

- - - - -

The four girls stood outside the changing room, waiting with baited 
breath for the Amane to pull the soft green curtain back.

After several fruitless trips to various stylish designer outlets, Amane 
having rejected each of the girl&#39;s suggestions as they put them forward, 
the older Etoile had finally conceded and picked something herself from 
the endless rows of clothing racks within a more mainstream department 
store, shrugging uncomfortably before Shizuma had ushered her off into 
the changing rooms at the back.

It seemed like an age since Amane had disappeared within, and Shizuma&#39;s 
voice bristled with impatience as she called,

&quot;Well?&quot;

Amane was quiet for a minute, then called back from within,

&quot;It looks okay, I&#39;ll change back so I can pay for it.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s eyes sparkled mischievously,

&quot;You&#39;re not getting away with it that easily,&quot; and with a deft hand she 
whipped the curtain back, revealing a sheepish looking Amane within.

The tall Spican stood considering herself in the long mirror on the 
wall, clad in a close fitting pastel two piece; the halter-neck top 
showing off her slender shoulders and back, while the matching trousers 
seemed to stretch endlessly, showcasing the athletic fifth year&#39;s mile 
long legs.

Hikari&#39;s face beamed, and Nagisa and Tamao seemed approving, but 
Shizuma&#39;s keen eye looked Amane up and down. Decisively she remarked,

&quot;The top is nice; halter-neck definitely suits you. But the trousers 
Amane? Jesus, didn&#39;t your mother tell you that you were born a woman?&quot;

Amane blanched, her face dropping in red-faced disappointment.

&quot;I... - &quot;

Hikari shot the former-Etoile an angry look, but Shizuma continued 
regardless,

&quot;Come with me.&quot;

Taking Amane by the hand, Shizuma dragged her off across the shop, 
scouring the aisles as they walked. Looking back occasionally at the 
Spican Etoile trying to keep up with her, she pondered, deep in thought.

Then with an inspired flash, she grabbed something from one of the 
racks, shoving the hanger into Amane&#39;s hands.

&quot;There, go and try that.&quot;

Sullen, Amane did as she was told, wandering back to where they&#39;d left 
the other girls at the changing rooms, scratching the back of her head 
as she quizzically regarded the garment in her hands.

Reaching the changing rooms again, Amane disappeared within, sliding the 
curtain back behind her, and Shizuma grinned at Nagisa with telling 
eyes. Curious, Nagisa shot the former-Etoile a questioning look, to 
which Shizuma simply returned a knowing smile. Hikari, unsure what to 
make of the exchange, waited patiently for Amane to finish getting 
changed.

&quot;Oh...&quot;

Amane&#39;s quiet voice emanated from within.

&quot;It&#39;s not the sort of thing I&#39;d usually wear.&quot; Her was voice layered 
with uncertainty.

&quot;Yes, I had a feeling you might say that,&quot; Shizuma replied with a smile, 
then reaching for the edge of the curtain, she asked, &quot;Ready?&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Amane replied quietly, and again the former-Etoile whipped 
the curtain back.

Nagisa&#39;s jaw dropped as the four girls took in the sight before them.

Standing uncomfortably, obviously unsure of how to hold herself, the 
Spican Etoile wore a skin tight, burgundy coloured cocktail dress. With 
a ruffled front to exaggerate her breast, a high halter-neck and 
plunging back, the dress followed the curve of Amane&#39;s figure perfectly, 
the hem stopping midway down the fifth year&#39;s shapely thighs, the small 
side splits leaving more than enough to feed a curious imagination.

She looked perfectly stunning.

Moving to stand behind the dark haired Etoile, Shizuma ran her fingers 
through Amane&#39;s dark hair, sweeping it back and holding it tight. She 
looked into Amane&#39;s deep brown eyes in the mirror, catching the Spican&#39;s 
gaze.

&quot;There, much better don&#39;t you think,&quot; she said softly.

Amane stood looking at herself in disbelief, the graceful feminine form 
staring back completely alien to her. Outside the booth, Nagisa and 
Tamao stood speechless.

It was only of Hikari&#39;s tiny voice that broke the silence.

&quot;I - &quot; Hikari was strangely uncomfortable, biting her lip before 
mustering the courage to spit the words out,

&quot;I preferred the other outfit a lot more,&quot; she said, almost stammering 
the words. She looked at the floor and fiddled with her hair.

Tamao and Nagisa exchanged puzzled glances, and Shizuma looked at the 
first year in confusion,

&quot;Hikari?&quot;

Blushing, but asserting herself, Hikari looked Shizuma in the eye.

&quot;Yes, I definitely prefer the other one,&quot; she said.

Amane turned, looking fondly at her fellow Etoile.

&quot;Then the other one it is,&quot; she said decisively, stepping away from 
Shizuma before the former-Etoile turned to leave the changing room.

Shizuma stood bewildered, unable to comprehend Hikari&#39;s reaction. She 
looked at Nagisa as Amane closed the curtain behind her so she could 
change. Nagisa shrugged, similarly confused. Even Tamao looked towards 
Hikari with a puzzled expression.

Hikari had turned away from them, looking out across the shop.

A moment later, Amane re-emerged, the familiar tom-boy look intact once 
again. She stepped forward and ruffled Hikari&#39;s hair. Hikari turned, her 
blue pools beaming as she looked up fondly into Amane&#39;s eyes.

&quot;We should get yours now Hikari,&quot; the older girl remarked, before 
placing the dress Shizuma had picked on the pile to be re-hung and 
heading off to pay for the two piece she&#39;d chosen earlier.

Waiting until she was sure Amane was out of sight, Shizuma took the 
dress, placing it under something she&#39;d picked for herself earlier. 
Vexed, she followed the other two on their way to the cashier desk.

- - - - -

Chiyo sighed as the counter bell rang noisily, jarring her from her day 
dream as she sat at the library front desk. Disgruntled, she looked up, 
annoyed at being disturbed on a Saturday evening when she knew all too 
well no one would be checking books out. The shift went so much quicker 
if she lost herself in her thoughts.

To her surprise, she found herself facing the imposing gaze of school 
Presidents Miyuki Rokujo and Chikaru Minamoto. With a gulp, she 
stammered in a small voice,

&quot;Rokujo-san and Minamoto-san. Uh, is... is there something I can help 
you with?&quot;

Arching a dark eyebrow, Miyuki leaned forward across the solid wooden 
counter, looking the first year in the eye.

&quot;There was something we wanted to ask you about Tsukidate-san.&quot;

Shrinking back into her chair, Chiyo swallowed uncomfortably again.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

- - - - -

&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want a lift back to the Dorms?&quot; Shizuma called 
through the cold wind, &quot;the snow is quiet heavy.&quot;

Tamao looked back down the path from the station, shaking her head,

&quot;No it&#39;s fine thank you. I could do with the walk.&quot; Smiling she added, 
&quot;Thank you all for a wonderful day! See you tomorrow!&quot;

She pulled the collar of her jacket around her and shuffled within it 
cosily, waving one last time before turning and continuing on her way 
home.

Nagisa shouted after her,

&quot;Take care Tamao-chan!&quot; She stood for a moment, watching Tamao disappear 
over the hill before opening the door to the black Bentley, stepping 
into the warmth of the waiting car.

As the other girls shuffled across the seats, Shizuma closed the door 
behind her, leaning forward to the partition window.

&quot;That&#39;s everyone thank you.&quot;

Responding politely, the driver called back,

&quot;The summer house Miss Hanazono?&quot;

&quot;Please.&quot; Shizuma responded, then sat back in her seat as the window 
slid to.

Amane looked around the car, admiring the soft leather seats and 
expensive looking interior, the Hanazono emblem embodied in gold thread 
across each door. The fifth year was suitably impressed.

&quot;The Hanazono family does well for itself I take it?&quot; Amane asked.

Shizuma smiled,

&quot;We&#39;re not the Rokujo&#39;s, but we can hold our own I guess.&quot; She brushed 
snowflakes from her trousers, adding &quot;It&#39;s not far, we should be home 
soon.&quot;

Nagisa rested her head on Shizuma&#39;s shoulder, patting her satisfied 
belly.

&quot;At least we don&#39;t have to worry about food. When was the last time you 
did any cooking there anyway?&quot;

The older Miatorian laughed.

&quot;The cupboards have been empty for years.&quot;

Nagisa pondered, her hand moving to play with the gold key at her breast 
through the fabric of her top. Thoughtful, she muttered,

&quot;It will be strange going back.&quot;

Conscious of the others in the car, she didn&#39;t elaborate.

&quot;So this is where you stay in the summer?&quot; Amane asked.

Shizuma shook her head,

&quot;No, I rarely use it at all. I stayed there for a bit with Kaori, but 
generally Mother uses it for entertaining guests.&quot;

Amane and Hikari looked unsettled at the mention of the former-Etoile&#39;s 
name, but Shizuma smiled softly.

&quot;It&#39;s fine, really.&quot;

Nagisa idly picked at Shizuma&#39;s jumper, feeling a little unsettled all 
the same.

&quot;So what do you want to do with the evening?&quot; Shizuma asked, changing 
the subject.

Amane shrugged,

&quot;I&#39;ve not seen a film in a while.&quot;

Shizuma grinned,

&quot;Surely you can be a little more creative than that?&quot;

- - - - -

The living room was cosy, a roaring fire burning in the wide stone 
hearth set into one wall. With the curtains drawn and the chandeliers 
set to a low light, the shadows danced in time with the flickering 
flames within the fire place, giving the room an atmospheric mood. Soft 
music played in the background, emanating from cleverly concealed 
speakers. Amane sat together with Hikari, the girls curled up on one of 
the sofas, Hikari lying with her head in the older girl&#39;s lap.

Nagisa stood lost in thought at one of the windows, holding the curtains 
slightly apart, watching the snow and the foul weather outside. Although 
it wasn&#39;t unpleasant being back at Shizuma&#39;s vacation home, she wasn&#39;t 
completely at ease either. Especially with Shizuma having excused 
herself before disappearing upstairs somewhere.

She stared out across the bay, watching the waves lap against the shore. 
It would be beautiful here in summer, she thought, a pang in her heart 
as she realised Shizuma would graduate long before their next 
opportunity to come here in the hot season.

Amane stroked Hikari&#39;s soft golden hair, smiling at the deep blue eyes 
gazing up at her.

&quot;This place is amazing,&quot; she said, calling over her shoulder to Nagisa.

The younger Miatorian sighed, turning to rejoin the others, sitting in a 
plush arm chair next to the sofa.

&quot;The red leaves in autumn are gorgeous,&quot; she muttered.

&quot;You&#39;ve been here often?&quot; Amane asked.

Eyes transfixed on the dancing hearth, Nagisa mumbled her reply 
absently,

&quot;No, just the once.&quot;

They fell quiet for a moment, Amane picking up on Nagisa&#39;s downbeat 
tone.

Then from the broad stairway at the other end of the room, the sound of 
heels on the hard wooden floor broke the silence.

Shizuma had obviously disappeared upstairs to get changed, and Nagisa&#39;s 
eyes widened as she looked the former-Etoile up and down, the sixth year 
sauntering towards them in a tiny black dress, her usually lose hair 
tied back in a taut french plat that hung behind her, the end almost 
reaching the hem of her dress. She was carrying a bottle of something 
expensive looking in one hand and four champagne flutes in the other.

Setting them carefully on the antique coffee table in front of the 
hearth, she wandered to the mini-bar set back in one of the dark corners 
of the room, placing the bottle on the bar-top while unwrapping the foil 
cover.

&quot;Sorry for taking so long,&quot; she said, stripping the remaining bits of 
foil from the neck of the bottle. She looked sideways at the others, a 
grin on her lips,

&quot;Vanity and all that,&quot; she said, emerald eyes twinkling like the 
dangling silver earrings she&#39;d chosen to go with the dress.

Hikari sat up, and Amane peered over the back of the sofa at the bottle 
in interest.

&quot;Nothing special, just some cheap stuff Mother keeps for the guests. She 
won&#39;t miss it,&quot; Shizuma explained, idly tossing the scrunched up foil 
into the bin underneath the bar, the golden lettering of the word 
Bollinger shining in the dim light against its dark green background.

Expertly undoing the wire seal, she gave the cork a twist before it slid 
free with a loud pop.

Nagisa, eyes still firmly fixed on the sultry figure of the 
former-Etoile, watched quietly as Shizuma wandered back over to the 
others, setting the bottle on the table, leaving it to rest for a 
moment.

&quot;I thought we should celebrate properly. After all, it&#39;s been a big week 
for us all.&quot;

Amane ran her fingers through Hikari&#39;s hair, smiling,

&quot;Not necessarily how we expected it to turn out though,&quot; she said, 
smiling at Shizuma. &quot;You certainly have a flare for the dramatic.&quot;

Shizuma actually blushed, before coming back with a coy reply,

&quot;You know me Amane; couldn&#39;t possibly do it by halves.&quot;

She glanced at Nagisa, the nearby fireplace reflecting in her eyes.

Pouring the bubbling golden liquid, she passed each of the girls a full 
glass before pouring her own, resting the bottle in an ice bucket she&#39;d 
left next to the coffee table. She perched on the edge of the arm chair, 
one hand resting fondly on Nagisa&#39;s shoulder, the younger girl holding 
the hand lovingly.

&quot;So, to Hikari-sama and Amane-sama, Astrea&#39;s new Etoile!&quot; She raised her 
glass in cheer. Before raising her own, Amane added,

&quot;And to Shizuma-sama and Nagisa-chan, the most beautiful couple in 
Miator!&quot;

With a clink of glasses, the girls took a long sip, savouring the 
delicate taste.

Nagisa almost choked as the fizzling liquid tickled the roof of her 
mouth, causing Shizuma to laugh hysterically.

Nagisa went red in the cheeks, before sticking her tongue out and 
downing the rest.

&quot;Mmm, yum!&quot; she said.

&quot;Not tasted champagne before?&quot; Shizuma asked, watching Nagisa lean 
forward to pour herself another glass.

Nagisa giggled,

&quot;No, although I could get used to It quickly.&quot;

Shizuma chuckled before taking the bottle from Nagisa&#39;s hand, topping 
everyone&#39;s glasses up equally. Putting the left-overs back on ice, she 
took the bucket back to the bar, leaning over the wooden bar top to 
fiddle with the stereo behind.

&quot;Now then, about this movie nonsense,&quot; she muttered, looking for a 
particular album amongst the pile. Finding what she was after, she 
flicked the case open, pushing the disc into the stereo slot before 
punching the controls with her thumb until she found the track she was 
after. Making sure the others didn&#39;t see, she turned the volume control 
a considerable number of points towards the obscenely loud position.

Grinning as she looked back over her shoulder at the others, she waited 
a moment for the track to start.

Hikari jumped with a start as a growling base tube woke the floor boards 
from their sleep, unfamiliar european dance music skipping through the 
air, classic blues vocals ripped over a mess of funk and dirty beats.

Shizuma laughed at the look on their faces, the glee in her eyes not 
often seen before, easily resembling that of a girl half her age. She 
tipped her head back, wiggling happily to the rhythm before winding her 
way down the front of the bar, letting the hem of her dress brush the 
rim of her heels as she glanced back mischievously at Nagisa, before 
righting herself and making her way back to the fire place. Still 
dancing, she kicked her heels under the solid oak coffee table before 
hopping up onto it, arms moving gracefully through the air, hips 
skipping to the music bouncing across the room.

She remained there for a moment, the others watching in awe. Amane 
glanced at Nagisa before calling over the music,

&quot;Is there anything the former-Etoile can&#39;t do well?&quot;

Nagisa, dumbstruck with a look of disbelief still written across her 
face mumbled back,

&quot;No, probably not.&quot;

Shizuma chuckled again, then reached her hands out to Nagisa. The fourth 
year withdrew deeper into the arm chair, shaking her head. She shouted 
back,

&quot;You&#39;ve seen me dance Shizuma, I couldn&#39;t possibly do that!&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s eyes twinkled evilly, and she beckoned again.

&quot;You won&#39;t learn unless you try,&quot; she replied. Turning on the spot, her 
silver plat whirling in a wide circle, the lithe sixth former wound her 
way back down again before bouncing back to her feet as the music jumped 
pace, a crescendo of snares and fan fares peaking before the bass ground 
its way back into the floor. Nagisa looked apprehensive, but put her 
hands out gingerly for the older Miatorian.

Grinning, Shizuma grabbed them eagerly and pulled Nagisa up onto the 
table, turning her on the spot before her so she could place her hands 
on Nagisa&#39;s hips from behind. Pressing herself close into the fourth 
year&#39;s back, she gently gyrated Nagisa&#39;s hips, forcing her into time 
with the music. Leaning into Nagisa&#39;s ear, she whispered playfully,

&quot;Besides, it&#39;s easy. It&#39;s just like making love.&quot;

She pushed the red head&#39;s waist, and the two girls wound down together, 
moving in unison before righting themselves and continuing to dance.

Hikari tugged at Amane&#39;s arm, the older Etoile still sat speechless.

&quot;Will Amane-senpai dance with me too?&quot; Hikari asked.

Eyes wide, Amane looked at the blonde girl in disbelief,

&quot;What, like that? I can&#39;t do that, I&#39;ll look stupid!&quot;

Shizuma laughed,

&quot;Drink some more then Amane, you won&#39;t care after a while,&quot; before 
nestling her head back into Nagisa&#39;s neck.

Hikari grinned, standing as she pulled Amane to her feet.

&quot;It looks like fun, and I don&#39;t care; Amane-senpai looks amazing 
whatever she&#39;s doing.&quot;

And with that, she threw herself round Amane, the Spican girls following 
suit, Amane very unsure of what she was doing but Hikari having a huge 
amount of fun all the same. As the evening went on and the alcohol began 
to take effect, the girls danced away; laughing at themselves, laughing 
at Shizuma&#39;s eclectic taste in music, and laughing at each other, 
relaxed and happy just to be away from the stresses of the world.

- - - - -

Miyuki smiled to herself as she paced the hallways of the Strawberry 
Dormitories, working her way toward her destination.

When Chikaru had originally approached her, she had no idea what to make 
of the Lilum President&#39;s concerns, wondering if Chiyo had stumbled over 
a Miatorian drug ring or something similarly exotic or bizarre. 
Initially she&#39;d considered passing the issue on, but given her place at 
Miator, and not wanting to wake the Sister, she knew it was easier for 
her to deal with it herself. She&#39;d openly laughed when Chiyo&#39;s big 
secret had turned out to be that Shizuma was staying in Aoi-san&#39;s room, 
but as she&#39;d pondered the ridiculousness of the evening later, the fact 
nagged at her more and more. Shizuma was actively avoiding returning to 
her own room, simply because it was next to Miyuki&#39;s.

It smacked of a guilty conscience, and Miyuki had pondered the 
implications at length. Perhaps there was still a glimmer of hope.

Having bumped into the couple a fair few times during the week, Miyuki&#39;s 
confidence had returned as she adjusted, and she&#39;d decided it was time 
to confront Shizuma again. Perhaps by appearing at Nagisa&#39;s room she&#39;d 
have an edge, capitalizing on that guilty conscience as she caught them 
in their hiding hole together.

Reaching the fourth year&#39;s room, she grasped the door handle, taking a 
deep breath. Then, without knocking, she swung the door open wide.

Startled, Tamao pulled her arms around her shoulders, trying to cover 
herself. She was stood in the middle of the room, her half fastened 
winter ball gown hanging off her shoulders. She&#39;d obviously been 
admiring herself in the wall mirror, and Miyuki dipped her eyes for a 
moment as Tamao adjusted herself.

Looking embarrassed, Tamao said,

&quot;Rokujo-san. You&#39;ve always stressed it was impolite not to knock.&quot;

Miyuki replied with an offhand tone,

&quot;So I have.&quot; Looking around the otherwise empty room, she added, 
&quot;Shizuma and Nagisa aren&#39;t here?&quot;

Tamao looked at the floor, a flush coming to her cheeks.

&quot;No, they&#39;re away for the weekend.&quot;

&quot;Oh, is that so,&quot; Miyuki muttered. &quot;You know it&#39;s against Dormitory 
rules to have someone stay in your room that doesn&#39;t belong there, don&#39;t 
you?&quot;

Her gaze still downcast, Tamao nodded slowly,

&quot;Yes Rokujo-san.&quot;

&quot;I could have the pair of you in front of Sister Mizue for this. You do 
realise that don&#39;t you Suzumi-san?&quot;

Nodding again, Tamao sullenly answered,

&quot;Yes Rokujo-san.&quot;

Miykui glanced around again, noting Shizuma&#39;s shoulder bag and clothes 
huddled at the end of Nagisa&#39;s bed. Realizing there was nothing more to 
gain from the visit, she turned to leave,

&quot;Tell Shizuma to clear out when she gets back or I&#39;ll report her as 
well.&quot;

She strode out of the room, but before she&#39;d closed the door completely, 
she muttered over her shoulder,

&quot;Oh, and Suzumi-san; the dress suits you.&quot;

And with that, she pulled the door to with a solid thud.

- - - - -

It was well passed midnight, moonlight spilling through the summer house 
windows as Amane made her way up the stairs towards the room Shizuma had 
allocated the Spica girls for the night. Unlike most of the rooms in the 
building, this was one of only two with a double bed, and although a 
little embarrassed, Amane had appreciated the consideration.

Hikari had disappeared a little earlier, and politely excusing herself, 
Amane had wandered off to find her, the journey somewhat complicated by 
the gentle swaying of the floor as she walked. Knowing she hadn&#39;t 
boarded a ship during the evening, she put it down to the considerable 
amount she&#39;d had to drink.

Shizuma would be a bad influence she thought to herself, despite 
admiring the older girl&#39;s confidence. She&#39;d obviously had much more life 
experience than the Spican Etoile; perhaps having someone around to open 
her eyes to the world a little wasn&#39;t such a bad thing. After all, the 
embarrassment of dancing aside, Amane had enjoyed the evening a lot.

Reaching the top of the stairs, the new Etoile made her way down the 
hall to the master bedroom on the first floor. Cracking the heavy door 
open, she peered into the dark bedroom beyond.

&quot;Hikari?&quot; she called.

When no response came, she flicked the bedroom light on. Covering her 
eyes for a moment, the harsh glare added to the alcohol-induced 
disorientation and it took a few seconds before she focused slowly.

The embroidered curtains drawn, Hikari was lying curled up on the 
king-sized bed, her tiny body gently sobbing with her head buried in the 
plush white pillows.

Concern jolted Amane to sobriety, and she hurried across the room, 
climbing onto the bed beside Hikari. Stroking the long blonde locks that 
concealed the younger girl&#39;s face, she asked,

&quot;Hikari, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Hikari continued sobbing, shaking her head softly.

Amane put her hands on Hikari&#39;s shoulders, turning them gently so she 
could see the younger Etoile&#39;s face. Ashamed, Hikari tried to look away.

&quot;Hikari?&quot;

The alcohol obviously having gone to the tiny Spican&#39;s head; she was 
flushed and hot, her eyes off focus and her pupils dilated widely.

&quot;Promise me Amane-senpai will never change.&quot; She mumbled, &quot;Promise me 
she&#39;ll always be the same!&quot;

Amane looked at her girlfriend in confusion, brushing the tears away 
carefully with her thumb.

&quot;What brought this on Hikari? You know how I feel about you.&quot;

Hikari shook her head again, and sobbed as she buried her head in 
Amane&#39;s shoulder. In a muffled voice, she said,

&quot;It&#39;s not that. I know Amane-senpai loves me.&quot;

Amane continued to look puzzled, waiting for Hikari to elaborate.

&quot;You looked so different in that dress. You weren&#39;t my Amane-senpai 
anymore.&quot;

Amane looked stunned, leaning back so she could look Hikari in the eye.

&quot;But it was only a dress Hikari. It doesn&#39;t change who I am?&quot;

Hikari looked at the bed covers, trying to avoid Amane&#39;s gaze.

&quot;I just...&quot;

Amane brushed the tears from Hikari&#39;s cheeks fondly.

&quot;Does it?&quot;

Hikari shook as renewed sobs took her.

&quot;Oh Hikari.&quot;

Wrapping the young Etoile in her arms, Amane held the tiny girl close, 
burying her lips in Hikari&#39;s blonde locks before kissing the first 
year&#39;s forehead lovingly.

&quot;I&#39;ll always be yours Hikari, you know that.&quot;

Amane leaned back against the pillows, and Hikari curled up against her. 
The sobs continuing, the Spican girls lay there entwined, holding each 
other until finally, tiredness won out and they both fell asleep.

- - - - -

In the darkness of the living room, Shizuma lay on the sofa before the 
fire place, her silver hair loose and splayed across the cushions 
beneath her, the dishevelled form of Nagisa Aoi sat atop her pelvis. The 
two girls were naked, their warm skin covered by a thin layer of sweat 
that shimmered in the soft glow of the dying embers cradled within the 
stone hearth. Looking down and staring into the emerald eyes beneath 
her, Nagisa smiled, the golden key around her neck spinning on its 
glittering chain in the yawning gap between them.

Weary and content, the girls gazed into each others eyes, wordless 
emotions passing between them.

With a smile, Nagisa leaned further forward, whispering into the 
former-Etoile&#39;s ear.

&quot;And you promise you&#39;ll never take this away again?&quot; she asked.

Her pupils wide, a look of true serenity on her face, Shizuma whispered 
back,

&quot;Never.&quot;

With that she pushed Nagisa upright, propping herself up on one elbow 
before emptying the remainder of the champagne across Nagisa&#39;s chest, 
leaning forward to rescue it before it ruined the sofa.
