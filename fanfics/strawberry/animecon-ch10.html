<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 10 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a>

<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>&quot;I thought I was to act as an advisor?&quot; Shizuma asked, obviously annoyed 
by the turn of events and stood leaning over the end of the table, hands 
gripping the rim, her knuckles white.

The council chamber was full of representatives from Miator, their black 
uniforms flanking the table, key students from each of the six years and 
a hand full of varied volunteers present, all of whom had gathered to 
receive their allotted responsibilities for the Christmas Ball that 
Miator was due to host in a fortnight&#39;s time.

Miyuki was sat at the other end of the table, co-ordinating the 
proceedings from behind a large array of paperwork and the meticulously 
prepared plan she had presented to the Sister, making sure that each 
student understood their given role and the time frame they had in which 
to carry it out.

Not long after the council session had begun, the brooding sixth year 
had turned her attention to Shizuma, the former-Etoile one of the first 
to be assigned her particular task.

There would be a range of jobs available at various stages during the 
coming fortnight; at first the older students would be charged with 
purchasing materials and supplies, the younger girls with turning those 
supplies into decorations, tickets, posters and the like. The posters 
would then need to be displayed across the estate, as well as the 
tickets sold and distributed to their owners. As the day itself drew 
closer, the hall and the food they planned to serve would need 
preparing, not to mention other peripheral tasks such as cloak room duty 
and similar that would need covering on the Saturday evening the Ball 
was due to take place.

None of which, the former-Etoile thought, required her to spend two 
weeks locked in the Green House, filed conveniently out of the way.

She stared at the school council President who sat at the other end of 
the table, Miyuki&#39;s expression set and her will unbending, the other 
students in the room watching the exchange in silence. There would be no 
ground given on this Shizuma realised, and any argument the silver 
haired girl attempted now would be conducted publicly. After the stress 
of watching Nagisa dragged through the Etoile election and the resulting 
come down from the previous day at her Mother&#39;s house, Shizuma simply 
didn&#39;t have the energy left and decided it wasn&#39;t worth the hassle to 
push matters, especially given her former room mate&#39;s disruptive new 
hold over Nagisa.

Miyuki replied in a calm but assertive tone,

&quot;Yes Shizuma, and come the new term when your other skills are required 
they will be called upon. But for now, your place is in the Green House. 
No one else has as much experience managing it on their own as you and 
we&#39;ll desperately need those flowers.&quot;

Miyuki gestured freely,

&quot;Take who you need if you feel it&#39;s necessary; perhaps you could save 
our resources and enlist Amane&#39;s help, you seemed to spend a fair amount 
of time in there with her during her brief time as Etoile,&quot; Miyuki 
shrugged her shoulders and gestured loosely with her pen, &quot;Regardless, 
it&#39;s the best use of your talents that I can see.&quot;

The school council President looked back at her plan, dismissing the 
subject as closed and Shizuma was left at the other end of the table 
with her head hung, her long hair falling forward.

Without looking up, Miyuki added,

&quot;I won&#39;t keep you any longer Shizuma, it&#39;s late enough as it is; feel 
free to leave when you wish,&quot; after which she moved on to the next name 
on her list.

Gathering her composure the former-Etoile straightened up, trading brief 
glances with Nagisa who was sat further down the table beside Tamao, a 
world away and looking lost and just as vexed by the situation, before 
the slender sixth year turned on heel and strode toward the door.

It appeared her contribution to Miyuki&#39;s grand scheme would be ending 
there.

The two Spicans sat speechless, Yaya lying on her Dormitory bed, her 
younger companion perched beside her in silence, listening to the sound 
of the third year breathing and the occasional student passing in the 
corridor outside.

It was several hours after Yaya had left the administrator&#39;s office, and 
having returned to her Dormitory as instructed, she&#39;d curled up on her 
bed, her dark eyes closed and her heart heavy as she dozed in and out of 
sleep, emotionally drained and physically exhausted.

The argument with Shion had left the young girl barren, unsure of what 
she felt, unable to decide whether she was angry, upset, lonely or 
bitter. She just was; and at this stage felt nothing more. Tsubomi was 
sat on the edge of the bed, next to the sleeping figure with her long 
legs crossed, her fingers playing idly with her long pink hair which 
spilled over one shoulder and down the front of her white uniform. She 
fiddled with the soft strands, bending and twisting them in distraction, 
wanting desperately to reach for the girl beside her, dying to touch 
Yaya&#39;s soft skin or offer her words of condolence in the hope she could 
draw some life from the sullen figure. But nervousness and the complete 
lack of communication since Yaya had left the Dormitory office presented 
an insurmountable wall, and instead she found herself sitting in limbo, 
unsure whether she should stay or go.

As Yaya had exited the Sister&#39;s room to find herself facing Tsubomi, the 
two girls had fallen into an awkward silence, the third year too crushed 
to process the situation and Tsubomi too nervous to question the older 
girl in fear of being sent away again. She&#39;d caught the end of the 
incident in the Cathedral courtyard, and driven by a mixture of concern 
and her own enduring loneliness, she&#39;d come to wait outside the office 
for Yaya to be dismissed.

As the intimidating wooden door had swung open, the plaque with the 
Sister&#39;s name on catching the light as it did, Tsubomi&#39;s heart had leapt 
to her throat and she&#39;d immediately presumed Yaya would shoo her away. 
Instead she&#39;d found herself looking into the same blank expression that 
remained on the seemingly sleeping face beside her now, the third year 
failing to raise an objection as her quiet companion had fallen into 
step beside her on the way back to the Dormitory. Once they&#39;d arrived, 
Yaya hadn&#39;t once asked Tsubomi to leave either.

Instead, they just sat there in silence, Yaya in her drained state, 
Tsubomi wishing she could do something to help.

It was getting late and as the shadows crept across the Dormitory floor, 
Tsubomi knew she would have to think about returning to her own room 
soon or get caught wandering the halls. Even now she struggled to sneak 
around the way the others did so easily. She had always been clumsy like 
that and she wished she could be a little more graceful, and not just 
physically; no one else in the same situation would&#39;ve spent the entire 
evening staring at the floor she told herself.

She tugged at a knot in her hair in annoyance, wincing as she pulled the 
pink strand free.

Defeatism winning over, she was just gathering herself to leave, having 
resigned to the idea that there was nothing she could do to make the 
either of them feel better when Yaya woke with a start, sitting up from 
the bed and glancing around in a daze.

She&#39;d been dreaming Tsubomi thought, and as the deep brown eyes took in 
the world around her, the younger girl&#39;s gaze softened as she watched 
Yaya come to.

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot; she asked in a small voice,

Yaya propped herself up on one arm and rubbed the side of her head with 
the other, moaning in dismay at the horrible feeling of being 
over-hungry and dehydrated.

The jolt had sparked some life into her at least Tsubomi thought.

&quot;Were you dreaming Yaya-chan?&quot; the first year asked, flushed slightly 
and apprehensively awaiting a response.

Yaya turned her attention to her companion and as she took in the 
pensive figure before her, Yaya felt a nagging sensation of unease. The 
first year shouldn&#39;t be here. This would only end messily if Yaya gave 
the younger girl the wrong impression. Despite being so overwhelmingly 
spent earlier, she shouldn&#39;t have let the younger Spican come back to 
the Dormitory.

Sighing, she was about to say as much when the first year jumped up from 
the bed and disappeared into the bathroom in a hurry, talking over her 
shoulder as she said in a busy voice,

&quot;You&#39;ve not drunk anything in hours, it&#39;s no wonder you feel bad. Stay 
there and I&#39;ll get you some water.&quot;

And as Tsubomi set about making herself useful to avoid the possibility 
of being told to leave, Yaya groaned, no happier about the situation but 
far too exhausted to protest.

- - - - -

As the council chamber started emptying out, Miyuki glanced across the 
table at the weary looking form of Tamao Suzumi, the new Etoile sat 
quietly in her chair, watching the other Miatorian girls leaving via the 
wide double doors. The pretty fourth year was lost in thought, her 
expression one of deep contemplation as she churned something over 
inwardly. Nagisa had already excused herself, looking flustered and 
strung out, the day having gotten the better of her and the red head&#39;s 
temperament growing worse as the meeting had drawn to a close. The 
feelings she&#39;d voiced earlier in the Cathedral corridor, prior to the 
coronation had been echoed by her actions that evening, and with a wry 
smile Miyuki noted that the Aoi girl would definitely remain a handful 
despite being so totally devastated by the new arrangement.

Shizuma&#39;s character was rubbing off on her.

Tamao on the other hand seemed to have taken things well, and the school 
council President found herself surprised by the apparent lack of 
friction coming from the other fourth year. Nagisa had been quick to 
stamp her displeasure on the whole situation, but Tamao hadn&#39;t mentioned 
a word. If anything, she almost seemed almost indifferent to the current 
state of affairs; a stark contrast to her timid pleas not to enter the 
two room mates together for the race between Spica and Miator to succeed 
Shizuma.

Miyuki peered at the fourth year, wondering what it was that had her so 
distracted, and called in her soft voice,

&quot;Suzumi-san?&quot;

Tamao turned with a start, regarding the older girl in surprise,

&quot;Rokujo-san?&quot;

Miyuki smiled pleasantly,

&quot;You were daydreaming. It&#39;s late; perhaps you should go and get some 
sleep, it&#39;s been a busy day.&quot;

Tamao nodded, then looked at her lap for a second, forming her 
ponderings into a question.

She returned her gaze to the school council President, and asked,

&quot;Do you think this will work out Miyuki?&quot;

The older girl returned a puzzled frown, her brow furrowing,

&quot;Will what work out Suzumi-san?&quot;

&quot;Nagisa and I. As Etoile,&quot; Tamao tipped her head and shrugged her 
shoulders as she replied,

&quot;Everything is so complicated now. I...&quot;

Miyuki waited for the fourth year to continue, but instead Tamao fell 
silent, obviously having decided not to finish her sentence.

The senior student sighed as she began gathering up her things from the 
table and placing them in her bag, rolling the parchment plan up 
carefully before tying it again with soft green ribbons. As she worked 
she responded flatly,

&quot;Nothing has changed Tamao, even now. In three months time Shizuma 
Hanazono will leave Astrea Hill, and when that day arrives, all those 
complications you&#39;re worrying about will simply disappear.&quot;

She put the plan to one side on the table and lifted her bag with both 
hands to make sure everything had settled at the bottom, before closing 
the clasp that held it shut with a sharp snap,

&quot;Once she&#39;s gone, you and Nagisa will be free to get on with your 
lives.&quot;

Satisfied she had everything, Miyuki put the rolled up parchment under 
one arm and lifted her fabric bag in her free hand.

Tamao watched the older girl get ready to leave, desperately wanting to 
mention the couple&#39;s rings having caught only part of the conversation 
in the Cathedral corridor earlier that day; certainly not enough for 
clarification. Had Shizuma confirmed that she and Nagisa were engaged? 
Could they even get engaged? What would happen when Shizuma graduated? 
She needed answers, but Miyuki seemed like the wrong person to ask and 
Tamao resigned to avoid the questions, unable to gather her courage. If 
Miyuki was as shrewd as she seemed, surely she&#39;d have accounted for the 
rings in her reply already, although how the council President could be 
so dismissive of such an enormous event she was unsure.

Curiosity getting the better of her, she asked in a small voice,

&quot;Why do you hate Shizuma so much now Miyuki-sama?&quot;

Miyuki looked back at the fourth year with bemused smile,

&quot;Hate her? Tamao-san, what makes you think that? She&#39;s never meant more 
to me than she does right now.&quot;

- - - - -

Nagisa hurried her way through the dark Dormitory corridors, a sense of 
urgency overwhelming her as she made her way back from the Christmas 
Ball meeting. The atmosphere had almost choked her, and after several 
hours of false pleasantries she&#39;d felt her nerve slip and she&#39;d started 
snapping.

She couldn&#39;t believe Miyuki had managed to engineer everything so 
perfectly. It was as though Amane and Hikari had never entered the 
election race in the first place. And now the annoying cow had pretty 
much banned her from seeing Shizuma for the remaining two weeks of term, 
filling her itinerary with endless meetings and preparations while her 
beautiful fianc&eacute;e was filed away in the Green House. The only time 
they&#39;d get together would be late in the evenings and by then she&#39;d be 
so tired she wouldn&#39;t present much in the way of company for the 
former-Etoile at all. Not to mention the fact both girls should be 
revising for the spring exams.

With such realisations building up, the fourth year had struggled to 
keep her tongue after Shizuma had been dismissed from the council 
chamber and she was happy the ordeal was finally over.

Reaching the stair case, she worked her way up to the sixth year floor 
and passed through several antiquated fire doors before approaching 
Shizuma&#39;s Dormitory. A wave of relief washed over her, and knowing full 
well Miyuki was still downstairs, she knocked loudly on her girlfriend&#39;s 
door before turning the handle and poking her head round into the room 
itself.

Shizuma looked up from her bed, the former-Etoile curled up in her night 
gown, lounging under the covers and reading a novel in the low light of 
her desk lamp. She smiled fondly and beckoned the younger girl in,

&quot;She finally let you go?&quot;

Nagisa closed the door behind her, locking it before dropping her school 
satchel and climbing onto the bed, leaning forward and closing the 
hardback Shizuma held in her hands, before filing it on the floor out of 
the way.

Reaching awkwardly underneath herself, she pulled back the top sheet and 
slid into the bed next to Shizuma, enveloping her girlfriend in a warm 
embrace as the two girls entwined in their cosy cocoon.

Shizuma smiled as Nagisa buried herself in the older girl&#39;s slender 
neck, pondering some elicit tease until with surprise she felt moisture 
on her shoulder, warm tears rolling down her skin and into the hem of 
her night gown.

She leaned back so she could see Nagisa&#39;s face,

&quot;Nagisa? What&#39;s wrong my love?&quot;

The younger girl just shook her head and sobbed gently, letting the 
day&#39;s pent up feelings wash over her.

Understanding, Shizuma gave Nagisa the time to vent, the former-Etoile 
lying silent with her lips buried in Nagisa&#39;s hair, the soft scent of 
the fourth year&#39;s conditioner filling her nostrils as she stroked the 
soft auburn locks between her fingers.

She drew Nagisa closer, holding her fianc&eacute;e dearly,

&quot;It&#39;s just us now Nagisa, it&#39;s over.&quot;

- - - - -

The meeting had taken much longer than Miyuki had expected, so when she 
finally reached the Lulim corridor she noted with relief the soft light 
spilling out from underneath Chikaru&#39;s door.

Straightening herself out, the council President knocked softly on the 
wooden surface and waited patiently for the fifth year to answer.

An eventful few days Miyuki thought to herself, fingers playing with the 
edge of the stiff parchment roll under her arm. Certainly she couldn&#39;t 
have asked for things to have fallen more beneficially.

Light spilled into the dim corridor as Chikaru drew the door back, 
smiling pleasantly at the Miatorian before her. The Lulim President was 
still in uniform despite the late hour and held a pencil in one hand, 
suggesting she&#39;d been busy with something to pass the time.

&quot;Miyuki-san, welcome.&quot;

Miyuki nodded her head politely and picked her bag up as she followed 
Chikaru&#39;s sweeping gesture to enter,

&quot;Apologies it&#39;s so late Chikaru, the meeting took longer than I&#39;d 
planned.&quot;

Stopping in the centre of the colourful room, Miyuki turned back to the 
Lulim girl and added,

&quot;This can wait till morning if you&#39;d prefer.&quot;

Chikaru tipped the door to and shook her head slightly, her long black 
hair rippling.

&quot;No, its fine Rokujo-san, I wasn&#39;t planning to go to bed just yet 
anyway,&quot; she replied and motioned to some sketches lying on her study 
desk.

Miyuki smiled and glanced around the room, taking in the hectic collage 
of dresses, costumes, paintings and rows upon rows of books. It had been 
a long time since she&#39;d been in Chikaru&#39;s Dormitory, and she marvelled 
at her colleague&#39;s creativity. The long room shrank under the sheer 
volume of work she&#39;d crammed into it, and how the young woman found the 
time to do so much was beyond the sixth year.

She smiled and glanced sideways,

&quot;How do you manage it Chikaru?&quot; she gestured around her, &quot;Do you ever 
sleep?&quot;

Chikaru shrugged sheepishly, and then motioned for Miyuki to sit on the 
bed, taking her own place on the desk chair.

&quot;You brought the dress?&quot; Chikaru asked, finding herself 
uncharacteristically anxious. This whole situation still didn&#39;t sit 
quite right in her mind, but as she&#39;d told herself earlier, she couldn&#39;t 
pass this up.

Miyuki nodded and opened up her deep fabric bag, drawing some folded 
blue cloth from within.

As the sixth year unfolded it carefully, Chikaru took in the shimmering 
material, the soft texture and the complexity of the cut. Miyuki stood 
and let the dress unfurl itself before her, the garment falling short of 
the sixth year&#39;s thigh. It had obviously been a fair while since she&#39;d 
worn it last, yet despite that the design was particularly daring, the 
style more something the Lulim President would expect to see a woman 
five year&#39;s older than either girl was now wearing, and certainly at 
some form of notable function rather than anything routine.

Chikaru leant forward, rolling the fabric between her fingers whilst 
admiring the seam work. Wherever Miyuki had originally bought the dress, 
it had certainly been expensive,

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful Miyuki,&quot; she said.

Then she paused, and tipped her head as her brow creased,

&quot;I&#39;ve seen this before?&quot; she asked in a puzzled voice.

Miyuki shrugged casually,

&quot;That would be unlikely Chikaru. You know how rarely I have call to 
dress up.&quot;

To which the Lulim girl nodded in agreement, although still thoughtful 
as recognition nagged at her.

She passed another eye over the dress and looked up at the sixth year 
standing before her,

&quot;The important question is what you want done with it.&quot;

She reached back across her desk and took the hanger she&#39;d left out 
earlier, offering it to Miyuki.

As the Miatorian slipped the tiny shoulder loops onto the hanger, she 
turned the hook sideways and left the dress on the front of Chikaru&#39;s 
wardrobe door where they could both still see it.

&quot;Well I&#39;m somewhat taller now, and when I last wore it the cut was quite 
close. The replacement will need altering to fit me now.&quot;

Chikaru frowned again,

&quot;This was tailored for you?&quot;

Miyuki nodded, pushing her falling black bob back behind one ear.

&quot;It was a present yes.&quot;

Chikaru sat back, considering the silky blue outfit before her. She was 
certain she&#39;d seen the dress before, but couldn&#39;t possibly imagine a 
younger Miyuki wearing anything so... overt.

&quot;And you want to keep the cut as it is?&quot; she asked, surprised Miyuki 
would wear something so daring now, let alone far enough in the past for 
the dress to have fitted properly.

Miyuki nodded,

&quot;Possibly a little less loud, but I still want it to catch the eye.&quot;

The Lulim girl nodded, still puzzled, and took a tape measure from the 
desk beside her.

&quot;Apologies, but I&#39;ll need you to take your uniform off Rokujo-san,&quot; she 
said.

The older girl nodded and slipped her shoes off before unclipping the 
clasps at the back of her Miatorian dress. Chikaru politely looked away 
as Miyuki slid the garment off, straightening out her silk slip and 
brushing her hair back with her fingers.

As Chikaru turned back, she pinched the metal end of the tape measure to 
warm it.

She glanced across the slender figure of the Miatorian, the young woman 
before her looking infinitely different out of the unflatteringly stoic 
uniform the girls were made to wear. Chikaru had never been fond of the 
founding school&#39;s style; it rarely complimented anyone. At least the 
Lulim uniform was vaguely attractive, although not as fashionable as the 
Spican one she thought.

&quot;Apologies if this is still cold,&quot; Chikaru said, grinning.

Miyuki returned the smile, and looked away as Chikaru set to work. 
Gazing across the room, her eyes caught something amongst the pile of 
stuffed toys on the fifth year&#39;s bed, and she chuckled,

&quot;Ohshibaru.&quot;

Chikaru looked up from her position kneeling before the Miatorian,

&quot;Yes, she left him here for safe keeping.&quot;

Miyuki shook her head gently in amusement, then added in a sentimental 
tone,

&quot;You weren&#39;t much different once. I remember you and that tiger you used 
to drag to summer school each year.&quot;

Chikaru&#39;s face took a wistful expression and she nodded at the bed with 
fond eyes,

&quot;She&#39;s in the pile somewhere. She still sleeps beside me.&quot;

Miyuki scanned the mess of multi-coloured fur and fabric, and as her 
dark eyes caught the soft white and black strips of the toy in question, 
her gaze softened as she found herself reminiscing.

- - - - -

Eager to get back to someone that spoke a language she didn&#39;t have to 
think about to use, Miyuki hurried back down the winding school corridor 
to rejoin her room mate. A chill breeze whistled down the hallway she 
paced, the age of the building showing in the creak of the floor boards 
and the draught coming from each of the aging metal window frames. Even 
when shut tight, they still leaked heat like a sieve and their guest 
quarters felt like a freezer in the morning as a result.

France in winter was dramatically different to Japan, and when they&#39;d 
left on the European exchange, the third year had no idea it would be so 
cold. Nor that she would see so much snow. Astrea rarely saw as much 
fall, and certainly not for such a long period of time in one go.

In fact it&#39;d done nothing but snow since they&#39;d arrived. So much for 
taking in the attractive Burgundy landscape; everything was white.

Trotting down the stairs between floors, Miyuki&#39;s long hair bounced 
behind her and she almost slipped on the bottom step, catching the 
banister just in time to steady herself. She had no idea why she was in 
such a hurry to see Shizuma again, she&#39;d only left the pretty third year 
an hour or so ago having been asked to help one of the older Japanese 
school council students. That said, were she being totally honest with 
herself she&#39;d have to admit that the whole trip abroad had intimidated 
her greatly, and she was glad to have a familiar face alongside her.

She had to stop for a moment, trying to remember which corridor to take 
at the end of the hall, but having recognised a sign stuck to one of the 
doors, despite being unable to read it, she opted for the left passage 
and it wasn&#39;t long before the door numbers started looking familiar 
again and she was back at her own room.

Without thinking, she turned the handle, and as she poked her head round 
the corner, she saw Shizuma jump with a start, pushing something under 
her pillow, the silver haired third year lying across one of the two 
Dormitory beds on her front, her face flushed and her pupils dilated 
widely.

Recognizing the face regarding her, she huffed in displeasure and pulled 
a magazine back out from underneath her pillow, launching it across the 
room at Miyuki.

&quot;Didn&#39;t anyone teach you to knock Miyuki?&quot; she snapped in embarrassment.

As the dark haired third year closed the door behind her, she stooped to 
collect the crumpled magazine from the floor, turning it over and 
catching the words Le Perla written in bold lettering across the front. 
It was a lingerie catalogue, and Miyuki rolled her eyes at her room 
mate&#39;s perverse nature.

Shizuma grinned back playfully,

&quot;Take a look, you might find yourself something I can admire you in.&quot;

The young council assistant threw the catalogue back at Shizuma and took 
a seat perched on the end of her uncomfortably soft bed.

&quot;You&#39;ll want to put that and the rest of your &#39;literature&#39; somewhere 
safe tonight; we have someone staying with us for the rest of the week.&quot;

Shizuma looked up from the floor where she&#39;d leant from the bed to 
retrieve the discarded magazine, her soft hair falling across her face.

&quot;Oh? Anyone nice?&quot;

Miyuki glared back,

&quot;You&#39;re so shallow Shizuma, and it&#39;s certainly no one that would take 
your interest.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s green eyes teased,

&quot;You sound so put out. Who is it?&quot; she asked.

Miyuki leaned back on her bed, looking across the room thoughtfully, her 
mind elsewhere as she replied,

&quot;Little Chikaru. She ended up in a room on her own and the Sister caught 
her crying last night. They asked if we wouldn&#39;t mind having her here to 
keep her company.&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s eyes lit up as she righted herself and sat back on the bed, 
flicking her silver locks behind her,

&quot;How quaint; we&#39;ve not slept in the same bed in forever.&quot;

Miyuki blushed slightly and the subject brought her back to the 
conversation. The third year hadn&#39;t considered that aspect of the 
arrangement. She looked down beat,

&quot;I&#39;ve not asked in - &quot;

Shizuma cut her off,

&quot;I was teasing Miyuki. It&#39;s fine.&quot; She smiled at her room mate, not 
having wanted to upset her. &quot;Besides, I might share with Chikaru for all 
you know.&quot;

Miyuki didn&#39;t rise to the bait and remained sullen.

&quot;So what did the council say?&quot; Shizuma asked, trying to change the 
subject, &quot;did they talk about the leaving party?&quot;

Miyuki nodded, her dark hair shimmering as it moved,

&quot;It&#39;s being held in the main hall on the night before we go, third and 
fourth years only. We&#39;ve got to dress up formally, ball gowns and heels, 
school ribbons and everything,&quot; she explained.

Shizuma grinned and considered her options. She hadn&#39;t brought much with 
her, an unfamiliar situation for the young student who was used to 
having her entire wardrobe at hand; her life very much rooted at Astrea 
unlike the other girls who went home for the holidays.

Grinning, she turned to Miyuki,

&quot;So what are you wearing? I should match you since we&#39;ll be going 
together.&quot;

Miyuki glanced back at her room mate, Shizuma having been unfalteringly 
attentive during the trip, away from the distraction of the younger 
girls she usually flirted with at the Strawberry Dorms. The change was 
heart warming and somewhat appealing if the third year was totally 
honest. Miyuki rarely felt pretty and one thing Shizuma certainly had 
down to a tee was the smooth flattery she wooed the other girls with.

&quot;Um...&quot;

Shizuma fiddled with her top knot and shot her room mate an expectant 
look,

&quot;Um?&quot;

Miyuki mumbled and then replied quietly,

&quot;My mother sent me something before we left.&quot; She added after a pause, 
&quot;It&#39;s from him.&quot;

Shizuma stopped what she was doing and let her hands fall from her hair, 
grinning in excitement,

&quot;A dress Miyuki?&quot; Her eyes beamed.

The other third year nodded slowly, and added,

&quot;She made me send measurements and everything. It&#39;s very, um...&quot;

Shizuma leaned forward on the bed,

&quot;Very, um...?&quot;

But Miyuki remained silent, failing to answer.

Shizuma pressed,

&quot;Well, where is it then?&quot;

Miyuki motioned toward her bag at the end of the bed,

&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure if I should unpack it.&quot;

Shizuma leapt up eagerly and started rummaging through the black trunk, 
noting Miyuki also had a very flattering silk slip she&#39;d never seen the 
other girl wear which she might borrow herself later. Miyuki was still 
such a little girl in so many respects Shizuma thought to herself. A 
shame really, since she certainly didn&#39;t look like one anymore. Turning 
over the contents, she found a neatly wrapped parcel at the bottom,

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Miyuki said, and drew up legs up in front of her anxiously, 
hugging her ankles. She was obviously embarrassed by the garment.

Shizuma returned to her bed with the parcel and started unwrapping it,

&quot;He made this for you?&quot;

Miyuki nodded,

&quot;As a gift. I&#39;m supposed to wear it if they&#39;ve sealed the engagement 
when we return for Christmas.&quot;

Shizuma caught the underlying sentiment and looking up, replying in 
concern,

&quot;Your Mother is still going ahead, despite what you said?&quot;

Miyuki nodded sadly,

&quot;Father is adamant.&quot;

Shizuma sighed, and returned a look of sympathy.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Miyuki. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s worse; my family who 
practically ignore me, or yours who seem intent on bargaining you off.&quot;

Miyuki let her long hair fall forward, covering her face slightly. 
Knowing there was nothing she could say to console the school council 
assistant, Shizuma continued unwrapping the dress instead, this 
particular subject covered many times and the silver haired girl never 
having found a way to comfort her room mate. Arranged marriage was 
certainly not high on Shizuma&#39;s to-do list as a result.

As she unfurled the shimmering blue fabric before her, Shizuma&#39;s jaw 
dropped as she regarded the garment she held.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; she mumbled, and stood so the dress could fall to its full 
length.

Miyuki peered out from under her hair.

&quot;I know. It&#39;s very...&quot; she searched for the words.

Shizuma nodded,

&quot;I know he&#39;s a designer and everything, but even still...&quot;

Shizuma stood stunned, her expression one of disbelief. Then as her eyes 
sparkled, she considered Miyuki sat across the room from her.

&quot;Stand up Miyuki,&quot; she instructed.

The other girl did as she was told reluctantly, and Shizuma held the 
dress against the slender figure next to her.

A coy grin spread to Shizuma&#39;s lips,

&quot;You&#39;ll look gorgeous in it.&quot;

Miyuki looked up in surprise,

&quot;I can&#39;t wear something like that Shizuma!&quot; Miyuki stammered.

But Shizuma&#39;s expression was already lost in thought, and her pupils had 
returned to the same dilated state they were in when the dark haired 
third year had arrived, her eyes huge emerald pools.

&quot;Oh you can and will young lady,&quot; she grinned vacantly, &quot;I&#39;ve got to 
have something here to match it,&quot; she mumbled as she searched her mind 
for the dresses she&#39;d brought with her.

Miyuki snatched the blue garment back uncomfortably, her face flushed,

&quot;No Shizuma, I can&#39;t. Everyone will laugh.&quot;

Shizuma turned her attention to the awkward looking figure before her, 
focusing intently on Miyuki&#39;s brown gaze,

&quot;No they won&#39;t. They may well be speechless, but laughing is something 
they certainly won&#39;t be doing.&quot;

She reached forward and started to gently pry Miyuki&#39;s arms from their 
position wrapped defensively around her front, the dress pinned against 
her,

&quot;You&#39;re going to look stunning Miyuki, and if I can find anything 
anywhere near as daring so will I. We&#39;ll be the talk of Astrea when we 
get back.&quot;

She smiled fondly as Miyuki&#39;s stance softened and the dark haired girl 
slowly allowed Shizuma to pull her hands away,

&quot;For you to be this shy I obviously don&#39;t tell you how pretty you are 
often enough.&quot;

Miyuki dipped her brown eyes and blushed.

&quot;Shizuma...&quot;

Just then, a soft knock came from the door, and a small voice mumbled 
something from the other side.

&quot;Come in,&quot; Shizuma called, still stood holding her room mate&#39;s hands 
before her, the blue dress hanging over Miyuki&#39;s forearm.

The tall door swung back slowly, relieving the tiny form of Chikaru 
Minamoto, the little Lulim girl wearing her checked uniform, her travel 
bag over one shoulder and a stuffed toy resembling a black and white 
tiger hugged tightly before her. She lowered her eyes politely and said 
in a small voice,

&quot;Hanazono-sama, Rokujo-sama. Sister said I was to stay with you for the 
rest of the trip.&quot;

A soft expression crossed Shizuma&#39;s face as she regarded the cute second 
year, the adorable red bow in her hair making the young girl look like 
one of the gipsy women she&#39;d seen in the French village nearby.

&quot;Yes Chikaru-chan. Come in and close the door.&quot; Shizuma said as she 
glanced sideways at Miyuki, her lips curled in sutble playfullness, 
&quot;You&#39;ll be sleeping in Miyuki&#39;s bed and we&#39;ll be sharing. Feel free to 
unpack your things and make yourself at home.&quot;

- - - - -

The spark of conscious rippled through Yaya&#39;s mind as she roused slowly 
from her slumber, the gap between dream and reality racing wide as her 
thoughts focused. It must be early she decided; the other side of her 
eyelids still dark.

Then as the pleasant smell of body spray caught her nose and she felt 
soft breath on her cheek, she kicked herself inwardly, not needing to 
open her eyes to know who lay next curled up in the bed next to her.

Cracking her dark lashes slowly, she took in the serene face of the 
first year laying next to her, pink hair framing slender shoulders, the 
bed covers wrapped around her snugly.

Yaya felt the young figure next to her, their legs entwined, Tsubomi&#39;s 
delicate skin soft against the naked third year&#39;s thigh and chest.

Sighing gently, Yaya tipped her head back, staring up at the ceiling as 
she sunk into the pillow underneath.

Self-control was a definite must on her Christmas wish-list.

- - - - -

Nagisa sat alone on one of the high backed sofas in the Strawberry Dorm 
lounge, her eyes down cast and gazing at the light from the window as it 
played on the polished wooden floor, her fingers toying with the soft 
platinum band on her finger.

She&#39;d fallen asleep in Shizuma&#39;s arms not long after arriving at the 
sixth year&#39;s Dormitory, the day and the stress that came with it having 
exhausted her. Waking early the following morning she&#39;d found herself 
feeling barely refreshed, and although her pretty fianc&eacute;e had done her 
best to try cheering the fourth year up, she hadn&#39;t left Shizuma&#39;s room 
feeling any better.

The former-Etoile had gone to check on Amane, the tall Spican not having 
been in her room when the silver haired Miatorian had returned from the 
Christmas Ball meeting, and Shizuma desperate to make sure things had 
gone well at the Konohana residence the night before.

Nagisa had embraced the older girl dearly before letting her go, the 
uncomfortable feeling in her heart magnified as her girlfriend 
disappeared off in the other direction.

She hated being apart from Shizuma, now more than ever, and despite 
telling herself over and over that it was only two weeks until the 
winter break she didn&#39;t feel any better for it.

Miyuki seemed hell bent on making her life as miserable as possible.

A strong winter gale was blowing outside, and as the wind caught the 
highest branches on the trees outside the first floor window, rocking 
them back and forth, the light filtering across the room flickered and 
danced in response, the sparkling reflection in the long varnished floor 
panels following suit. Just like me, Nagisa thought, dancing like a 
mannequin on its strings for everyone&#39;s entertainment.

Nagisa looked again at the ring on her finger, imagining Christmas day 
and how nice it would be when the two girls were free from the 
aggravation and intrusion at the Dorms. Mina&#39;s sincerity during their 
conversation at the Hanazono house drifted back into her mind, and 
Nagisa took a deep breath, gathering her composure ahead of the day. 
Tamao would be joining her soon, and the last thing she needed was to 
appear vulnerable in front of her room mate, the prying questions it 
would lead to likely to open doors for Tamao to peer through and raise 
questions the red head wasn&#39;t confident to answer without giving too 
much of her own feelings away.

Strangely, after all the time she&#39;d spent with Tamao letching over her 
since arriving at Miator, she now found herself intimidated by the 
pretty fourth year; the basics of their relationship having shifted so 
fundamentally since that evening in the Dorm when Tamao recalled the 
morning she&#39;d walked in on the Miatorian girls sleeping together.

Certainly, if the flat in Astrea became an option come spring time, she 
would be taking it she thought, presuming she could convince her parents 
that it was a good idea.

She looked across the quiet lounge, noting the time on the walk clock 
and the red head ran over the words to the Lords Prayer again, making 
sure in her own mind she could remember everything ahead of giving the 
blessing for the first time at breakfast. With dismay she noted she 
would be sharing a table with Miyuki and the other council Presidents, 
rather than with Shizuma, the couple having agreed to avoid further 
confrontation between the two former Miatorian room mates on the grounds 
that it would only incite Miyuki further. Sighing, Nagisa resigned to 
idea she was unlikely to see Shizuma again until the evening, unless 
they managed to grab a few moments here and there at meals or during 
recess.

&quot;Two weeks,&quot; she repeated in a sullen tone, and brown eyes sad, she 
picked herself up from the sofa and headed to her Dormitory to find out 
what was taking Tamao so long.

- - - - -

&quot;Amane?&quot; Shizuma called in a soft voice, knocking again on the Dormitory 
door, waiting impatiently for a response.

When none came for the second time, she tried the door handle, the cold 
brass knob turning in her hand but the door unmoving.

Amane never locked her door if she was in a room.

Shizuma frowned, and glanced around the corridor she stood in. None of 
the other Spicans were about with breakfast being so close; the hallway 
having already cleared out and the Miatorian was greeted by nothing but 
the sound of a draught from one of the fire exits.

The former-Etoile sighed, and stepped away from the door, pondering 
whether to try the stables or head to breakfast. The fifth year&#39;s 
disappearing act bothered her greatly, but at the same time she knew 
Nagisa would need her emotional support in the dining hall, even if it 
had to be given from the other side of the room.

Amane would have to wait Shizuma decided, her girlfriend coming first as 
she should. Looking one last time at the closed door beside her, the 
former-Etoile turned with a swish of her uniform and started off toward 
the lower floor.

As she went, dark eyes watched her from the other end of the corridor, 
curiosity and concern telling in the expression behind them.

- - - - -

It was cold, freezing cold, and despite the heavy overcoat the fifth 
year wore, Kaname found herself shivering nonetheless.

The trip to the Spican equestrian centre was framed by a thunderous sky, 
the trees and shrubs flanking the stone path bowing under the force of 
the wind as it ripped across Astrea, a storm very much on it&#39;s way.

The tall girl&#39;s hair blew wildly in the wind, and not for the first time 
she questioned exactly what the fuck she was doing, the warmth of the 
breakfast hall a much more appealing prospect.

She&#39;d be hungry well before lunch too.

But having watched Shizuma leave the Spican corridor, the school council 
assistant had pondered Amane&#39;s locked door herself, wondering what the 
frustrated look on the Miatorian&#39;s face had been about. A certain little 
bird had whispered into her ear during the previous evening that Amane 
had been seen leaving the estate in one of the Hanazono limousines, and 
when Kaname found Shizuma lurking around the Spican hallway earlier she 
knew straight away that something was going on.

One immediate possibility came to mind, and the implications nagged at 
her curiosity, although she knew all too well the consequences if Momomi 
discovered where her room mate had disappeared to rather than joining 
the brunette at breakfast; yet another barrage of snide comments on the 
cards the next time the two caught up.

The moody fifth year was really beginning to get on Kaname&#39;s nerves, 
their relationship becoming increasingly turbulent as the lack of 
something to focus on reduced their interaction to simple domestic 
squabbling. With Spica now firmly out of the picture in terms of the end 
of year calendar and Hikari long gone from Astrea, there was nothing for 
their previously devious ways to gravitate towards, and things were 
obviously becoming a little too &#39;routine&#39; for poor Momomi. Despite 
Kaname&#39;s continued attempts to make her peace with the fifth year, 
things regularly blew up in her face and their awkward conversations 
boiled over more often than not into blazing rows, or worse still, hours 
of Momomi sulking and the hurt looks that accompanied it. That in 
particular grated heavily at Kaname&#39;s patience, as it pulled at her 
emotional strings with annoying effectiveness.

Thank god they were getting their own rooms in year six she thought to 
herself.

A sweeping gust caught her flank, and her Spican overcoat blew open, her 
long athletic legs stung by the icy blast. Pulling the white fabric back 
around herself, she grimaced and hurried on toward the barn, cursing her 
inability to ignore all things Ohtori.

So much for burying the past.

As the sports champion reached the tall building, she gazed up at the 
dark windows of the wooden structure. The large double doors in the 
front of the barn were closed up and padlocked firmly, straining back 
and forth on their hinges as the gale rocked them. Obviously no one was 
planning to take the horses out in the poor weather, although given the 
smell of the stables who could blame them.

Kaname despised the animals.

Circling around to the side, her dark eyes scanning the structure for 
signs of life, Kaname caught a feint light seeping from underneath one 
of the storage buildings off to the side of the stable itself.

Wry bemusement crossed Kaname&#39;s face as she pondered the brick shelter 
that housed one of the boiler units. Surely not...

Striding across the muddy clearing, Kaname grimaced at the muddy flecks 
on her socks and the state of her shoes, doing what she could to wipe 
the wet sludge that caked the soles off across the edge of the concrete 
path way that ran to the boiler house. How in god&#39;s name did Amane 
tolerate all this? Surely she must spend half her life washing her 
clothes?

As the first spots of rain began to fall, the tall fifth year hurried to 
the shelter of the sloping tin roof and leaned against the slated wooden 
door to peer into the room beyond.

The light gave little away, and all she could see was the top half of 
the back wall and parts of the metal boiler and insulation which stuck 
into view. Certainly she couldn&#39;t hear anyone working within and the 
only noise emanating through the door was that of the low hum from the 
water pump.

She stood back, looking across the building&#39;s front, wondering if one of 
the janitors had simply left the light on after finishing some work or 
whether her gut instinct had some weight behind it.

With reckless flippancy she tried the handle, half expecting some form 
of alarm to go off given the array of &#39;do not enter&#39; and &#39;hazardous 
machinery&#39; signs hanging across the adjourning wall, only to find the 
door cracked open easily, the room surprisingly unlocked.

Sheets of rain hissed on the concrete path behind her, the splashes 
catching her exposed ankles with an icy bite. Looking over her shoulder 
and sneering at the discomfort, Kaname pulled the door open gently, 
glancing across the room before her with curious eyes.

The long brick shelter was overwhelmed by the large cylinder and 
accompanying pipes of the boiler seated in the centre of the room, the 
fluffy looking insulation wraps that covered the metal work giving off 
an odd odour like wet newspaper. Further back in the room, behind the 
main machinery of the boiler was a raised platform with a set of iron 
steps running up to it. In the dim light of the single dusty strip light 
that hung from the ceiling, Kaname could just about make out the corner 
of a blanket peeking out from behind the obscuring structure of the 
water tank.

Shaking her head in disbelief, she entered the building, pulling the 
door closed behind her and wandering over to the stairs.

Warmth radiated from the boiler as she passed it, and the air hung heavy 
with damp water vapour. The iron steps gave a dull ring as she climbed 
them, her view of the back area revealing the huddled form of Amane 
Ohtori curled up against a roll of insulation fibres stashed against the 
rear wall, the brown woollen blanket she had seen from the entrance 
wrapped around the Spican. She was out of uniform, wearing her brown 
leather jacket, a jumper and what looked like a pair of jeans.

Kaname was struck by pity, her heart sinking for her fellow fifth year.

&quot;Dear god Amane, what are you doing to yourself?&quot; she muttered, and 
stood regarding the young woman lying asleep on the floor. Even in her 
slumber, she looked alone and miserable.

She knelt beside the failed-Etoile, taking in the tear stained face, the 
dishevelled hair and the drained colour of the young woman&#39;s skin. 
Kaname&#39;s dark eyes narrowed as her expression took on a troubled look.

This was ridiculous, she thought to herself.

&quot;Amane Ohtori, what in god&#39;s name are you doing?&quot; she asked loudly, 
rousing the sleeping girl with a jolt.

Brown eyes opening wide, Amane glanced around her with a dazed 
expression.

&quot;Amane?&quot; the council assistant repeated.

The confused figure looked up at her companion, and squinted as she 
focused.

&quot;Kenjo-san?&quot; she mumbled, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Kaname&#39;s lips twisted in wry amusement,

&quot;What am I doing here?&quot; she asked sarcastically.

Amane caught the sentiment, and looked down at herself huddled under the 
blanket, taking in the awful smell of the insulation material on her 
hair. She grimaced as she sat up awkwardly, her left leg numb where 
she&#39;d slept on it.

&quot;I got back after curfew last night,&quot; she said, coughing to clear her 
throat as she finished.

&quot;What time is it?&quot;

Kaname frowned,

&quot;Breakfast time,&quot; she replied, then pressing the subject, &quot;Why didn&#39;t 
you just phone the Sister&#39;s office?&quot;

Amane massaged her leg into tingling life and muttered,

&quot;It&#39;s not important Kaname,&quot; then scratching the side of her head she 
added with rising worry, &quot;Did you come looking for me? Does the Sister 
know I was back late?&quot;

Kaname shook her head in reply and blanked the first part of the 
question given the awkward implications of answering it.

Did she even know herself why she was here?

She shuffled uncomfortably as she sat opposite Amane, tipping her head 
as her eyes became striking black slits,

&quot;You went to see Hikari last night didn&#39;t you,&quot; she stated bluntly.

Amane turned in surprise, her face falling when she saw Kaname&#39;s 
expression, the brooding stare piercing her. There would be no denying 
it.

She dipped her head and nodded slowly, taking on a blank expression.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Kaname asked, arching a dark brow.

Amane pondered her reply, a dull ache in her heart as she considered the 
previous evening, her trip to the Konohana house utterly fruitless.

&quot;Nothing,&quot; she replied in a flat tone, &quot;Her parents wouldn&#39;t allow me to 
see her.&quot;

She rested her head in her hands, her hair sticking out at awkward 
angles between her fingers.

&quot;I can&#39;t even be sure she was there,&quot; she finished quietly.

Kaname regarded the sullen figure before her in silence, a sympathetic 
look in her eyes, feeling an overwhelming urge to console the girl 
before her but not knowing how to express it. And so for a short while, 
the sound of the rain on the roof and the hum of the water pump 
dominated, Kaname idly picking at the blanket next to her.

Her thoughts ticking over, Amane eventually continued,

&quot;I still don&#39;t know why she left. Not really.&quot;

Staring blankly at the floor she muttered,

&quot;I think sometimes that it was my fault. I ask myself how she really 
felt about me.&quot;

Kaname sighed and butted in bluntly,

&quot;She was crazy about you Amane, everyone could see that.&quot;

Then with a pang of guilt she added,

&quot;Look at what she put up with to be with you.&quot;

Amane glanced across at the brooding figure next to her, surprised by 
the admission.

Kaname continued,

&quot;There was a thing with some fourth years outside the Spica building, 
after you both became Etoile. I don&#39;t know if she told you about it.&quot;

Dark eyes sparkling in the dim light, the fifth year continued,

&quot;Her first instinct then was to run to you. She couldn&#39;t wait to be 
beside you again.&quot;

Parsing her lips thoughtfully Kaname gestured,

&quot;She worships the ground you walk on Amane. I don&#39;t see how you could do 
anything to make her react the way she did.&quot;

Then ominously she offered,

&quot;Or any of us...&quot;

Amane raised her head from her hands, sitting upright as she regarded 
Kaname&#39;s lowered gaze, unsure what to make of those last words.

Then snorting in bemusement, Kaname muttered,

&quot;Women huh?&quot;

She cracked a wry smile and looked across at Amane,

&quot;What are we like...&quot;

Amane found herself amused by the fifth year&#39;s expression, the dire 
hopelessness of her situation summed up so beautifully by Kaname&#39;s 
flippant attitude. She was utterly devastated, but the ironic comedy 
struck her all the same.

Slowly her brow softened.

Sensing she was getting through to her companion, Kaname continued, 
adding with a sour tone,

&quot;If you think this is bad, trying living with Momomi...&quot;

She flicked her sloping fringe back from her eye and rose to her feet, 
straightening her skirt out before wrapping her coat back around her. 
Reaching down, she offered Amane her hand,

&quot;There&#39;s even a rumour going round that Shizuma and that Aoi girl are 
engaged. Can you imagine that? A whole lifetime of this shit? Is she 
feeling masochistic or what?&quot;

Amane couldn&#39;t stop herself from smiling as she accepted the boost, 
leaning against Kaname for a second as a wave of dizziness struck her.

She couldn&#39;t remember the last time she&#39;d had anything to eat or drink, 
and Kaname looked into the fifth year&#39;s eyes with concern.

&quot;You&#39;re a mess Amane, we can&#39;t have anyone seeing you like this.&quot;

Offering her former rival her arm, Kaname muttered,

&quot;Let&#39;s get you something to eat and a shower, or if you carry on this 
way I&#39;ll be in danger of actually beating you at something next year.&quot;

Then as the two girls stumbled down the iron steps, Amane leaning 
heavily on her companion for support, the pair headed towards the sound 
of the rain outside, Kaname adding with a smirk,

&quot;And then I&#39;ll never be able to shut Momomi up...&quot;

- - - - -

Sweeping down the dining hall corridor in a flourish of black fabric, 
Miyuki practically dragged Nagisa toward the seclusion of the stair 
well, out of sight of the other students as they dispersed towards their 
first class, Tamao struggling to maintain a graceful step as well as 
stay alongside them.

Stopping by the banister and making sure that no one was descending from 
above, the imposing sixth year snapped at the red head in a low voice, 
her brow taut and her eyes scathing,

&quot;It&#39;s his grace, not their grace, and next time, look at the girls and 
not the floor when you&#39;re addressing them.&quot;

Miyuki shook her head in irritation, and raised the fourth year&#39;s chin 
with her fingers, staring the younger girl directly in the eye.

&quot;Do you have any idea how pathetic your little sulks are in public? 
First you turn up late, then I find out you&#39;ve left your necklace in 
your Dormitory and you top it off by standing there like some spoilt 
little child having a tantrum.&quot;

Tamao stood silent, watching the exchange uncomfortably.

&quot;Like it or not Nagisa, this is your duty. The pair of you put your own 
names on that bit of paper, and regardless of how inconvenient it may be 
given the relationship you&#39;ve started since, this is still your 
responsibility.&quot;

She glared at Nagisa coldly, continuing her rant,

&quot;I won&#39;t allow another Miatorian Etoile to fail the girls she was 
instated to serve, not after that farce your beloved put us through over 
the past year. Whether you want to or not, you will do this properly, 
and certainly for as long as I&#39;m around to make sure of it.&quot;

Miyuki held the fourth year&#39;s gaze a few seconds more for effect, and 
then finished the fourth year with inch perfect precision,

&quot;Or if your position as Etoile is so inconveniently impacting on your 
relationship, perhaps you would rather I contact your parents to 
question your breech of uniform rules?&quot;

Her words stinging painfully, Miyuki released Nagisa&#39;s chin, stepping 
back before straightening herself out.

When she continued, her voice had returned to its usual level tone,

&quot;We have a meeting in the council chamber immediately after lunch to 
inform the other two schools of the plans for the Ball.&quot;

Turning her gaze to the dark haired Etoile stood to one side, she added,

&quot;Don&#39;t let her forget Tamao; I&#39;ve played more than my fair share of the 
find-the-missing-Etoile game.&quot;

She nodded curtly to the couple before turning on heel and striding off 
down the corridor towards the main entrance.

Nagisa stood red faced, her muscles tense and her head thumping. The 
corridor swayed unpleasantly and she looked across at Tamao who stared 
back with her usual attentive gaze, prompting the fuming red head to 
cover her face with clawed hands, holding them there while she silenced 
the rising scream in her chest.

Breathing deeply, she blinked back rising tears and slowly lowered her 
hands, regarding Tamao with a seething look.

&quot;Not a word,&quot; she muttered, &quot;Not a single word.&quot;

And with that she stalked off toward her first lesson, hoping she might 
fall off the world on the way.
