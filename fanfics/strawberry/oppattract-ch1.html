fanfiction by <a href="../authors/asakust.html">Asakust</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Lilac

Among the great wave of students, one girl stood out of the rest. She 
wore a dark navy blue and white sailor school uniform like most girls 
from public schools. The girl had shy blue eyes, soft blondish brown 
hair and very light skin. Her name is Konohana Hikari, she would like 
her friends to call her &quot;Hikari&quot; ... that is when she starts making 
some. But she liked to think that she had at least one, even though that 
girl didn&#39;t know it yet. She held a plain red handkerchief; her only 
keep sake, in her pocket and smiled highly hoping that she&#39;d meet that 
girl here again.

Hikari, unsure of where the school was, followed the wave of girls 
wearing the white and sky blue uniforms of st. Spica&#39;s Girls Institute. 
She tried not to notice all the girls staring and pointing at her, her 
mother had told her to expect it since she was wearing a different 
uniform on her first day as a transfer student.

Hikari didn&#39;t really want to transfer schools. She finally had some 
friends, nothing close... but at least it was some friendship of sorts. 
But two weeks ago, her mother was to be transferred to a franchise 
abroad and her father was already working in another country. Not being 
able to take Hikari with her, her mother decided to enroll her to a dorm 
school so that she didn&#39;t have to worry about her. She was crying when 
her mother had brought her to the school with her to fill in her 
requirements and arrange what she would need.

It was then that she met the person she believed is her first friend. 
She was sitting on the floor just outside the teacher&#39;s office, with her 
knees together and her legs to each side. She was crying. It was Sunday, 
so she was more or less safe from being seen by other students. Her 
mother was inside talking to her would be homeroom teacher, already 
asking to look out for her and help her in anyway she could.

Then all of a sudden, she heard a teacher inside yelling; &quot;Hey come 
back! I&#39;m still talking to you!&quot; it was soon after that did the room&#39;s 
door slid open revealing a tall girl wearing an all red and purple 
version of the white and blue spica uniform came out from the teacher&#39;s 
office. She had long dark hair, radiant amber eyes, and blas&eacute; expression 
on her face.

Their eyes met... and Hikari felt her heart beat faster. The girl in red 
lowered herself to half kneel and half sit with her hands on her knees, 
almost like the way a boy would. &#39;Tomboyish&#39; was her second word for the 
girl. The first one was &#39;Beautiful&#39;. And the third was &#39;Red&#39;. The teary 
eyed blonde girl had to mentally hit herself for guessing and checking 
the color of the girl&#39;s panties, especially after learning that she had 
guessed right.

Hikari blushed as the dark haired girl continued to look at her. The 
girl blinked a few times and stood up again. She watches the raven 
haired girl as she places her hand in her pocket, taking something out 
and dropping it wordlessly onto her lap.

In surprise, Hikari squeaked a bit and looks down at what it was. The 
girl had given her something red. And upon some examination, she found 
that it was a red handkerchief of the same hue as with just about 
everything the taller girl had been wearing.

Then without a word the other girl began walking away. No introduction, 
no questions, no small talk... not even a simple &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot;.

Hikari found herself drying her tears with the girl&#39;s handkerchief and 
even instinctively sniffed the small fabric afterwards. &quot;Lilac...&quot; she 
mumbled to herself. The girl&#39;s scent reminded her of the Lilac flowers 
in the park she so frequently visited. She recalled not crying since 
then... and visited the park more often, waiting for this day when 
she&#39;ll transfers into her new school in her hopes to meet the girl in 
red once again. Hikari made her way to the teacher&#39;s office to meet her 
new homeroom teacher.

She knocked on the door and opened it, then greeted the teachers a 
polite and respectful &quot;Good Morning!&quot;

One teacher who seemed to have been expecting her stood up from her seat 
and came forward. &quot;Good Morning. Konohana Hikari? I am correct?&quot; The 
older woman said.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Hikari greeted in a lively but shy voice.

The woman smiled and introduced herself as her new homeroom teacher; 
&quot;I&#39;m Misato, Katsuragi Misato. I will be you&#39;re new homeroom teacher.&quot; 
The purple haired woman introduced herself to her new student with a 
bright pleasant smile that almost screamed &#39;let&#39;s be friends&#39;.

&quot;Shall we get to class?&quot; She asked still with a bright smile.

&quot;Sure.&quot; Hikari nodded with a smile. Nodding to that Misato quickly 
picked up the attendance sheet and leads the new student to her new 
classroom.

Misato noticed that the girl was acting differently to how she first saw 
her. Gone was the scared little girl who was crying about being 
transferred into a dorm school because her mother had to move and work 
abroad. Something that made her smile, at the same time a bit worried... 
knowing and maybe slightly regretting who she had paired the girl up to 
in the dorm. It was almost like... giving a young lamb to a hungry wolf.

&quot;Are you looking forward to your first day Konohana-san?&quot; She casually 
asked as the two walked down the halls.

Hikari nodded and blushed, holding the red handkerchief. She took it out 
of her pocket and brought it near her face. She stared at it and 
prayed... &#39;Please let me meet her again.&#39;

Her teacher noticed this and asked; &quot;Is that a lucky charm?&quot;

&quot;Eh?!...&quot; Her teacher&#39;s question surprised her, not because of the 
question. But rather she was beginning to forget what she was doing, as 
she began to daydream. &quot;Ah...&quot; Hikari blushed; embarrassed that she was 
almost caught drifting into her dream world... by her own homeroom 
teacher on her first day. As well as realizing for the first time what 
the red handkerchief given to her now meant to her. &quot;Yes... I guess so.&quot;

&quot;It must be very special.&quot; Hearing that made Hikari&#39;s blush a few tones 
redder, but she nodded to answer the teacher... trying not to be rude on 
her first day. Misato giggled softly and dropped the issue, they were 
close to the classroom after all.

They arrived in front of the classroom door. One could hear that most of 
the students where still talking, which was something normal.

Misato turned to her new student, who was trying to stay calm. &quot;Are you 
ready to meet your new classmates Konohana-san?&quot;

Hikari took one last deep breath and nodded, saying; &quot;Yes.&quot; With all the 
determination she could muster.

&quot;Hehehe... You don&#39;t need to be so tense, Konohana-san. None of you&#39;re 
classmates would bite... well maybe there is one that would...&quot; She said 
with a smile, that said I&#39;m holding my laugh right now.

Hikari wondered about that, but decided she&#39;ll ask later. After all she 
could just be using a metaphor. Maybe there was a problem student among 
her class. That or someone does actually bite on her classmates. Her 
teacher&#39;s smile made her relax a bit, but it was enough not to look so 
stressed and stiff.

The teacher opened the door and walked in, she had timed it right when 
she was sure the class was off guard. She greeted them first with a loud 
happy &quot;Good Morning! Class!!&quot; Hikari stayed outside the door for now to 
wait and observed the class.

&quot;Sensei! That&#39;s the 3rd time you barged in not allowing us to properly 
greet you!&quot; Said a responsible looking girl, who Hikari assumed was the 
class representative. &quot;... And although I know you&#39;re just being 
friendly towards us. I must insist that you allow us to greet you 
traditionally with courtesy, unity and respect...&quot; said the girl.

The teacher however was pretending to be slumped on her desk and 
sleeping, ignoring the almost windy speech that her &quot;model student&quot; had 
given her. It made most of the class laugh... even Hikari, who was 
thinking that she might just like being with this class. The class 
representative sighed sadly and shrugged her shoulders giving up for 
today.

&quot;Well anyway!&quot; Misato got up from her pretend sleep and addressed the 
class. &quot;We have a new student joining our class.&quot; She then turned to 
look at the door where Hikari was waiting for her cue to come in, she 
nodded at the girl. Hikari immediately recognized it as her cue to enter 
and did. She walked till she was close to her teacher&#39;s side, she was 
handed a piece of white chalk wordlessly telling her to write her name 
on the board.

Konohana Hikari... She wrote her name the best way she could, after she 
placed the chalk down and turned back to her classmates.

&quot;Hikari, Konohana Hikari. I&#39;m pleased to meet you all.&quot; She was somehow 
able to introduce herself without stuttering, a great achievement 
considering how nervous she was right then. She then gave the class a 
traditional bow, then raising herself again and gave them the best smile 
she could muster.

The class began slowly gossiping and talking among themselves mostly 
about their new class addition. Something about being cute and looking 
like she belonged to a year under them.

&quot;Now let&#39;s see...&quot; Misato opened the class roster, which included 
seating arrangements. She looked to make sure which of the seats were 
really unoccupied and which had late, absent or lazy students. Seeing 
that which it was she looked over to Hikari who was just waiting for her 
to give her instructions. &quot;You can take last seat in the back, the one 
beside Tousaka-san.&quot; said Misato.

She then called and asked Tousaka Rin to raise her hand. Who did, 
guiding Hikari to her seat. The blonde girl thanked the dark twin tail 
haired girl, who smiled politely at her and welcomed her. Hikari sat 
down and glanced at the empty chair between her and the window, 
wondering if it was occupied.

The teacher then began talking about upcoming events for the school and 
things that the class need to prepare for. She also took the time to 
talk to her class and catch up with the latest gossip. One of the things 
the class liked about her was that she was fun to talk to unlike most 
teachers...

Misato was about to end the class when the door opened revealing a tall, 
long and straight raven haired girl. She lazily entered the class and 
walked towards her seat... without a word after closing the door behind 
her. The entire class except for one and the teacher ignored her... or 
at least dared not look.

Hikari recognized the girl immediately, even without the all red 
uniform. She smiled to herself and inwardly giving a small prayer of 
thanks to the Holy Mary... and had she not been in class and realized 
the familiar feeling of tension in the class air, she would have jumped 
for joy being in the same class as the girl who gave her the 
handkerchief.

&quot;Good Morning! Nanto-kun...&quot; greeted Misato a little nervously. She knew 
why the girl was late, and looked a bit tired.

&quot;...&quot; Nanto Yaya didn&#39;t answer, except for a short &#39;I hate you&#39; glare 
before taking her seat on the empty chair beside Hikari. She immediately 
crossed her arms on the desk and laid her head on them facing away from 
everyone else.

Hikari blushed, happily upon realizing that she was now right beside the 
girl that she had been dying to meet. She would occasionally gaze at the 
raven haired girl and pinch herself just to check if it wasn&#39;t a dream.

When the class ended, Misato told Hikari to drop by the teacher&#39;s office 
again during lunch or after all the classes were over. She didn&#39;t tell 
the young girl why, but she safely assumed that her teacher would be 
accompanying her to her new dorm room and help her get some 
requirements; such as a few pairs of uniforms and textbooks for her 
classes.

For the next few classes, Hikari noticed that all the teachers try to 
ignore whatever it was that the girl beside her was doing. That is... if 
she was doing anything at all other than taking a nap. She very much 
wanted to talk to the girl, but didn&#39;t want to interrupt her sleeping... 
especially since even the teachers wouldn&#39;t.

By lunch time, her other classmates took the time to talk to Hikari and 
inviting her to dine with them in the cafeteria. They asked her most of 
the things one asks of a transfer student, such as; &#39;Why did she 
transfer?&#39; &#39;How old was she?&#39; &#39;Did she attend a exclusive or coed school 
before?&#39; and other grinding questions. They also took the time to give 
her tips on fitting in with the school. It was a long conversation and 
Hikari very much wanted to ask about the formerly red clad girl.

&quot;Oh and whatever you do... it would be best to avoid Nanto-san.&quot; said 
one of her classmates.

&quot;Nanto...-san?&quot; Hikari recalled that she heard the name and was quite 
sure it was what Misato-sensei had called the girl beside her.

&quot;Nanto Yaya. Our batch&#39;s school delinquent.&quot; introduced another, who 
soon looked over her shoulder hoping that she was not hear by anyone.

&#39;Delinquent? That nice girl, that same one gave me this handkerchief?&#39; 
Hikari thought as she patted the small fabric over her skirt pocket. She 
was in disbelief and maybe she even wanted to deny their claims... but 
they should know her better than she does. After all she was just a 
transfer student.

Over the rest of the lunch time her classmates tell her all the details 
about Nanto Yaya. That other than being a pain for teachers who teach in 
their class, she does what she wants when she wants... and the teachers 
are too scared to do anything. She was from a prominent family, and so 
long as she had good grades they couldn&#39;t get her out of the school for 
some classroom misconduct. Hikari was told that the girl was so good in 
her art that she has never been caught or persecuted for pulling her 
pranks, vandalism and sometimes even bullying other students. They had 
even mentioned a rumor of her forcing someone into running around the 
school in the nude during class hours.

&quot;On the bright side, if you just keep your distance I&#39;m pretty sure you 
can have a peaceful high school life without her bothering you.&quot; said 
one of her classmates.

Hikari pondered on her classmates advices. She now had some idea on how 
the girl she was dreaming to meet acted in school. And honestly it 
scared her to think that it could be true. However if they were she felt 
that she wanted to know it for sure on her own and not just second or 
third handed stories. But that didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t scared of the girl 
now... No, all the information about the girl given to her by her 
classmates... terrified her. And when lunch ended and they had to return 
to class. She was scared stiff beside the presence of the seemingly 
lazing around girl.

Something Yaya had noticed, and smiled at. It took her a while to 
recognize the girl, mostly because she wasn&#39;t trying to. But she wasn&#39;t 
about to make anything of it. She continued to slump on her desk 
feigning disinterests to whatever happens in the class. She tried not to 
think about her homeroom teacher&#39;s request when she dropped by the 
almost empty classroom during lunch. The raven haired girl was very 
annoyed with the many demands the school has been making her do lately, 
especially since most of them she really rather not do. But despite this 
she had done them, because at least they weren&#39;t &#39;please be nicer&#39; or 
&#39;please get along with your classmates&#39; requests and it did keep 
everyone off her back for a while.

Classes soon ended, and most of the students had begun rushing to their 
clubs. The few girls that remained included the new student Konohana 
Hikari and Nanto Yaya. A few of their classmates converged towards 
Hikari. However they all stopped when they heard the rare sound of Nanto 
Yaya&#39;s Voice.

&quot;Konohana...&quot; she said as she stood right beside her.

Hikari almost jumped, the stories of the girl still ringing fear in her 
mind. She turned towards her, trembling a bit in fear. She swallowed... 
hard, trying to get some of the anxiety she felt away from her throat. 
&quot;Ye...ye...Yes?&quot; She had managed to ask.

There was a pause after Hikari&#39;s reply, even among the remaining 
classmates who just stared at the two. There was an odd tension in the 
room especially between the delinquent and the transfer student.

...to be continued.

PLEASE REVIEW!!!

Author&#39;s Notes: There the first chapter of Opposite Attract is out. 
Funny coz this was one of my earlier planned stories and some newer 
concepts got posted before it. Cameo appearances by Katsuragi Misato and 
Tousaka Rin. I used Rin because I&#39;ve already made her take the role of 
Yaya&#39;s long time classmate back in my other story &quot;Yaya&#39;s Voice&quot;. I used 
Misato because... she might be a good teacher... okay didn&#39;t think you 
buy that. hahaha XD Anyway she&#39;s there so she&#39;s there. Read it. like it
