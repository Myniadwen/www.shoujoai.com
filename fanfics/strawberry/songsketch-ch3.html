<h1>A Song and a Sketch (part 3 of 8)</h1>

<a href="../strawberry/songsketch-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Yaya didn&#39;t notice it at first, until the bartender pointed it out to 
her one night. Then having been told where to look, she eventually 
learned to identify Tsubomi&#39;s profile. At every performance, the younger 
girl sat at the same table near the exit. By the time Yaya would finish 
signing her autographs though, the pink-haired girl would be gone.

Yaya brought it up when she and Tsubomi had coffee again two weeks 
later.

&quot;You attend all of my performances.&quot;

Tsubomi looked carefully at the older woman, but Yaya&#39;s expression was 
neutral.

&quot;Do you mind? Or does it seem...stalker-ish?&quot;

Yaya smiled.

&quot;Not at all. At least, not coming from you. I just wondered why you do 
it. School can&#39;t leave you that much free time.&quot;

Tsubomi took a sip from her coffee, then looked at Yaya.

&quot;I love listening to you sing. I always have. Only now, it&#39;s better 
because you&#39;re solo all the time. Besides...&quot; She looked away. &quot;All 
artists need a muse.&quot;

Yaya laughed, embarrassed but touched by the younger woman&#39;s candid 
admission.

&quot;How come you always leave before I&#39;m completely free then?&quot;

Tsubomi smiled.

&quot;Come on, Yaya-senpai. Staying until the end would really qualify as 
stalker-ish.&quot;

Both women laughed.

&quot;Seriously, Tsubomi-chan, we could walk home together...at least part of 
the way or something.&quot; Yaya added, suddenly remembering that she didn&#39;t 
know where Tsubomi actually lived.

&quot;You walk home? Every night?&quot; Tsubomi raised an eyebrow in disbelief. 
&quot;That can&#39;t be safe.&quot;

&quot;The people in the area know me, so it&#39;s not that dangerous. Besides, 
the bar&#39;s only a 15 minute walk to my apartment.&quot;

&quot;In that case, I&#39;ll definitely stay until your gig&#39;s over. I can give 
you a ride home on my scooter.&quot;

&quot;Oooh. As if that doesn&#39;t qualify as stalker-ish.&quot;  

The look of glee on Yaya&#39;s face then made Tsubomi&#39;s heart skip a beat; 
the older woman had looked so much like her younger self. Never mind if 
she was back to teasing Tsubomi.</pre>
