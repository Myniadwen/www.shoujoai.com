<p>Momomi kicked the covers away idly and forced herself up out of bed, rubbing her eyes and yawning. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Note  to self… staying up until twelve talking about random things was a  really, really bad idea. Happiness is one thing but you still gotta get  up in the morning. </span></em>She stretched her shoulders, shaking her head  and slapping her cheeks a couple of times to shake the last vestiges of  sleep from her body. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I still need to go see Amane. I can’t wait to  tell her about everything that’s happened. Right now, I just need to  talk and talk and gush like a complete idiot, and I’d rather it wasn’t  with those three. Besides, Amane’s safe. It’s not like she’d tell  anyone. I’ll just have to concentrate on not embarrassing myself too  much. I still need to see if I can get her to take part in the school  play, for a start. </span></em>Momomi walked over to the vases, inspecting the flowers with a smile. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yeah.  And turning up at the Etoiles’ room at eleven and asking to borrow  another vase may not have been such a good idea, either. But it was  hilarious at the time. The look on Kariya’s face…not even her sarky  comments could take away that simple pleasure. That was awesome. </span></em>She touched the roses gently. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yeah.  Yesterday was one hell of a day, from the beginning to the end. Makes  me feel a little hollow, actually. How can anything follow that? Talk  about an emotional rollercoaster…</span></em> <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m still working it all out  in my head. It’s all too unreal. How can that have genuinely occurred,  when it was so much like a dream? When she said that, I didn’t want to  believe it, in a strange way. I’m still wondering whether I’m dreaming  or deluded or being misled somehow, it’s just too perfect. If that was  the case, this would be tragic. Well, these roses are real, and their  thorns are sharp, so that has to be proof. The world has good features  as well. Though no doubt I’ll go right back to pessimism the moment I  stop seeing the world through a romantic haze. I’m oddly glad of that  fact.</span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname made a small noise, turning over in her bed. Momomi  smirked and walked over to the bed, pulling the covers back and shaking  her by the shoulders. “Wake up, you lazy clod! Come on! The sun rises  on a beautiful day!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, gedoff…” Kaname grumbled. “I jus’ woke up. I’m tired.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No  excuses.” Momomi practically dragged Kaname out of bed, jumping back  and letting her stagger to her feet before she fell. “I thought you  were the early riser?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The occasional early riser,” Kaname corrected sleepily, yawning. “What about you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I evidently have more stamina than you,” Momomi replied. “Now hurry up and wake, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez, what’s the rush?” Kaname looked wistfully at her bed before sighing. “Always hurrying somewhere or other…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried not to stare at her girlfriend, dressed in nothing but a crumpled shirt and her underclothes. <em>I shouldn’t stare…but she’s my girlfriend now. It’d be impolite not to notice. </em>“Well, isn’t it nice to get up early and achieve more during the day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. You’re going to fall asleep in geography, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll  be fine. You’re just being cynical.” Momomi walked towards the  bathroom. “In any case, get our clothes out, and our books too. I’ll go  in here first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine…” Kaname grumbled. “Whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked. <em>Always so bad tempered in the mornings…</em>She  shut the door, leaning forwards and running the tap. She splashed water  on her face then filled a class with water, putting it aside and  applying toothpaste to her brush. Her reflection stared back at her,  looking vaguely amused at her ruffled hair and slightly reddened eyes. <em>I’ve always noticed…well, might as well say it. </em>“You  know,” she called. “It’s kind of interesting, but we pretty much skip  out on the keeping up appearances and angsting about what to wear to  dates phase, don’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Kaname agreed. “Suits me just fine. That crap doesn’t interest me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, don’t worry. I’m used to seeing you at your worst, so it’s fine.” Momomi began to brush her teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re the same, you know. But my main problem is you’re going to play dress-up with me anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi took her toothbrush out of her mouth for a moment. “You know me too well, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you’re kind of predictable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  this an interesting thing about the roommate system…” Momomi’s  reflection smiled maliciously. “It’s like we’re married or something,  isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t talk about that as if it’s a good thing,”  Kaname retorted. “We’ll be skipping the most spontaneous and exciting  parts of a relationship, and it all goes downhill from here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as cynical as ever,” Momomi observed, her reflection pouting momentarily. Then she carried on brushing her teeth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  she’d finished, she walked out and found that Kaname had all but  finished her part. They swapped roles with assurance. “Actually, we’re  probably more experienced than newlyweds,” Momomi quipped as she walked  past.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even worse, like I said,” Kaname replied without looking round.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  such a ray of light.” Momomi started to unbutton her shirt. “I’m sure  some marriages work. Even if things aren’t always so intense, isn’t  there something to be said for compassionate familiarity?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  Well, that depends on the person. Some people like that. Some people  ask life to bring on the affairs.” Water started to run.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? And  are you that kind of person, I wonder? Will I have to be very  vigilant?” Momomi tossed her shirt onto the bed; unhooking her bra and  letting it drop. She pulled a fresh one from her drawer and put it on. <em>As  tempting as it is to like Kaname do that as well, I’d better keep to  the lines we established. She doesn’t exactly handle change very well.  Hopefully this time will be different. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know about my inclinations. But right now, my inability means there’s currently no problem.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled. “You’re being very harsh on yourself, but I take your point.”  She dressed quickly. “And on another note… do you still remember the  time you walked in on me naked?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. That wasn’t too bad. Do you remember the time when <em>you </em>walked in on <em>me </em>naked?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, so that was worse. Not my fault. You should have locked the door.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should have knocked.” Kaname grunted. “But still, you went very red.  With the benefit of hindsight, I was very obtuse then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  giggled. “Well, hindsight makes everything appear so much easier,  doesn’t it? It makes you feel like what happened is inevitable, as we  accept the past as fact. The future's speculative, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Granted. But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there’s the past me being understandably uncertain. Then there’s the past me being bloody stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Well, quite. But we all feel like that. I know I do, about a lot of things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Like what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a secret.” She buttoned up her shirt. “Perhaps I’ll tell you some day. But in the meantime, you can guess away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted, stepping out of the bathroom. “Some things don’t change.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi grabbed her comb from the dresser and walked into the bathroom again. <em>It’s still kinda annoying that we have to do this. But I don’t think I want to be naked around her just yet. Give it some time…</em>her reflection smirked again. <em>That’s  still something good about this relationship. Kaname won’t force me to  do anything, because she takes ages to admit to herself that she even  wants to do it at all. </em>She ran a hand through her hair, untangling a few obvious knots, and wondered where to start.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname opened the door and stepped in, standing behind her. “Boo.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Hi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should let me do that, you know,” Kaname remarked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She hasn’t got dressed yet…well, of course. How could she have? </em>Momomi smiled. “Hmm… actually, that doesn’t sound like a bad idea. You’d better do a good job, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you expect anything less of me?” Kaname grabbed her wrist and dragged  her back to the dresser, placing her on the chair in front of the  mirror.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>On the other hand, perhaps she can learn. I could get used to this. </em>Momomi leaned back and closed her eyes. “Well, go on, then. You’re up against Luigia, by the way. She was very good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. She’s on the other side of the world. She doesn’t count.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t  you just afraid of losing?” Momomi teased. She opened her eyes and  looked at the mirror with interest. This was too much of an opportunity  to waste.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not afraid of losing to her at this,” Kaname  grunted. “In the same way I’m not afraid of admitting that I’d kick her  ass three times over in a fight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her jaw’s tight. Looks like she’s concentrating…how endearing. </em>“Of  course. Well, you aren’t having a fight, but you are brushing my hair?”  Momomi shrugged theatrically. “So it’s irrelevant, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, be quiet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She looks good in that shirt, too, ruffled is her look…</em>Momomi smiled as Kaname first touched her hair, running rough fingers through her brown tresses. <em>That feels nice. She’s surprisingly gentle. If a little clumsy, but that’s just how she is.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not as good as Luigia.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As fussy as ever…” Kaname started to comb her hair. “Be careful, or I’ll pull some out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s still fine, though,” Momomi conceded, smiling. <em>Kaname Kenjou, combing my hair…how the mighty have fallen.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’d do this either way. You might as well get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  sat in a comfortable silence for a few moments, Kaname gently brushing  her hair, before she spoke again. “Say… are you going to talk to Amane  this morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Momomi frowned slightly. “Even if you aren’t a fan, I quite like her. Besides, I do owe her for putting up with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you have to? Can’t you skip just this once?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry, nope.” Momomi grinned. “Try me when we’re married.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not even legal in this country, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did I say <em>to each other</em>?” Momomi teased. “We could just as easily seduce rich guys and asset strip them in high-profile divorces.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that possible, either?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not sure. This is why we need to study law.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you accuse me of being cold,” Kaname remarked. “But that’s not important. If you insist, I suppose it can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  when I’m using people, I do have some pride, you know.” Momomi looked  thoughtfully at Kaname’s frowning reflection. “Besides, she’s someone  who interests me. She’s so damned mysterious. Plus she’s pretty… well,  restful to talk to. I know what Olesa means now. It’s all ah and  indifference, but at least she’s reliable and doesn’t spread gossip.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can you not tell her about us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “Why? Like I said, she’s trustworthy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “I just wouldn’t like it, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I would like it. I mean, come on, I used her for this and she knows.  The least I can do for her is let her know what’s going on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “You’re going to carry on no matter what I say, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably,” Momomi admitted. “I won’t if you have a real reason. But I don’t really see anything to be worried about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, Amane…” Kaname frowned for a moment, then shrugged. “Never mind. Just… be careful, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “That’s touching. But I’m probably in more danger from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  Kaname had finished, they swapped places, Momomi playing with her  girlfriend’s hair and teasing her while she worked carefully. Then  she’d finished dressing, shoved her shoes on and packed her bag  hastily. “Can you get my breakfast for me, okay? Whatever’s cheapest is  fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay.” Kaname didn’t sound very happy, but she didn’t sound like she was about to argue either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “I’ll be back in time for breakfast, okay? Probably. I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. If you must.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now be good while I’m gone.” Momomi giggled at Kaname’s annoyed look. “Okay, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked away. “Just… be quick, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure.” Momomi turned and left, happiness bubbling up within her. <em>This  is real. This is as real as those roses, their beautiful red petals and  their sharp green thorns. It may be hard to believe, but it’s all real.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  air was cold and the sun bright but low in the sky, slanting through  the trees and half-blinding her. Crisp grass crunched under her feet. <em>It  is, perhaps, a beautiful day to look at that is less pleasant to be in.  Next time I’m in town, I should buy a coat. But that stuff doesn’t  really matter. </em>She walked into the forest, glad of the relative  solitude. She’d spent more time than she normally would getting ready,  what with one thing and another, but there was still plenty of time.  Momomi looked around idly, taking in her surroundings with an idle  concentration. <em>Yes, after a while, you look at this place without  seeing. I suppose that it just blurs into the background, because it’s  static, reliable and unchanging, even if it’s beautiful. I suppose I  thought like that for some time, but now I’m looking round and  remembering, and it has changed. Slowly, steadily, so I hardly noticed,  but still it changed. The leaves are brown now, and most of them have  fallen. A far cry from the brilliant greenery I saw when I first  arrived. The trees are gaunter and harder, older and more wizened, or  at least they look that way. But it’s still quite a beautiful place,  all the same, and I can remember that now. The greatest part of its  beauty is the simple tranquillity, as well. You could quite happily get  lost in the forest and wander for hours, circling the perimeter of the  lake. I’ve never done that, though. Somehow that just takes too much  energy, and after you’ve seen a little of it there’s a conceit that  you’ve seen it all, even though that’s clearly not true. What’s on the  other side? I don’t know. Does anyone know? It was this long before I  even thought to ask. But still, even if I take it for granted, it is a  beautiful forest. My mother must have been very happy in it. </em>Momomi smirked. <em>I’m sure I could make a metaphor out of this, but I’m not in the mood. Sometimes a tree’s just a tree.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane was exactly where she’d expected. She was quite reliable in that respect. “Yo,” Momomi said, waving cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked up and wrinkled her brow. “Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi came to a halt and looked down at her unlikely companion. “How are you today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged, completely unfazed, and picked another piece of egg up from her plate. “Well enough.” She ate it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see. Fair enough. I only have a few minutes, by the way. I need to eat  my breakfast.” Momomi sat down beside her, sighing when the appropriate  reply failed to materialise. “How are the horses?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They are  well. Starbright is a little flighty right now, I think he enjoys the  cooler air. Ganymede is similar, but I think she’s just following after  him. Sol, on the other hand, is quite tranquil by her standards. You’re  lucky.” Amane closed her eyes momentarily, smiling. “It’s often that  way. One leads, one follows and one goes the other way. But most people  would say I’m overanalysing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see,” Momomi said politely. “You pay close attention to them, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  nodded. “Of course. They’re very expressive creatures, you know. They  have moods and personalities, especially the hot-blooded ones. That’s  why I dislike horse riding as a casual pastime. They’re sensitive to  and for our purposes dependant on their rider and carers, so people  shouldn’t take them lightly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? I can’t really tell them apart. A horse is a horse, to me.” Momomi chuckled. “I guess I have a long way to go, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  nodded. “You are not bad in technical terms. But you still see Sol in  an excessively utilitarian light.” She shrugged. “Well, many would say  I’m overly sentimental. If you treat her well, there’s nothing for me  to fear.” She returned to her breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if you’re saying  it, I should probably take notice. Whatever you do, it works, right?  You’re rated as the young genius rider.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Amane closed her eyes. “I’m the best rider this school has.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked. “You say that very matter-of-factly…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  is a matter of fact.” Amane looked away. “But things are more  complicated than that. People look at me and say that Amane is an  amazing rider. I am technically skilled, but that’s a matter of good  training and hard experience. Much of the flair and excellence of my  riding comes from Starbright, though. We’re a team. This isn’t kendo.  My horse is my partner, but casual people only see me. They don’t  appreciate that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m pretty sure swordsmen can come to call  their swords their partners, you know,” Momomi teased. “And a fine  sword helps them excel, too. But it’s still their skill that is being  flattered by the blade. Not the other way round.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That may be  true. But if you ask me, horse riding remains the opposite kind of  sport in that. I can flatter my horse, and that does provide an extra  edge sometimes, but the horse is the decisive aspect.” Amane closed her  eyes. “That’s why horse riding is well-suited to nobility. It’s  expensive, and success can be brought, if you’re willing to pay the  price. I hate that kind of rider.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned and cocked her head. <em>Well…not exactly what I wanted to talk about. But still, if this is what she wants, I’ll grin and bear it. </em>“You’d probably hate my parents, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane shrugged. “Perhaps. But I should as easily hate my parents, and then myself. The difference isn’t great.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried to work this out. “So… basically you’re frustrated by that? The fact you’re so dependant on them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane smiled. “It makes sense that this would have occurred to you, as well. You, though, took action.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Well, it wasn’t like I wanted to, it was more like I had to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane looked away. “How are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m good.” Momomi’s eyes narrowed. <em>That  right question, but late, and ultimately she’s changing the subject. Is  she worried that I’m hitting closer to the mark? Or is she just jerking  me around again? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.” Amane was silent for a few moments, eating more of her food. “And how is Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s fine, I think.” Momomi closed her eyes, trying to find words. “Kaname, she… well, she confessed to me yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane glanced at her impassively, eyes narrowing slightly. Then she turned away and nodded. “Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah? That’s all you have to say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I anticipated this. That it should happen in the fullness of time, in any case.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, annoyed. “You sound pretty confident for someone who barely knows us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just shrugged. “Perhaps. In any case, congratulations.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, thank you,” Momomi replied sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wish I understood why she was slow and hesitant.” Amane frowned. “If  nothing else, Kenjou is decisive. Often violently so. But in this, she  was inept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re pretty uncharitable, aren’t you?” Momomi  muttered. “Well, it’s probably not something you’d understand, but it’s  something I went through myself. It’s very easy to be uncertain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re probably right.” Amane sighed. “I wish… I could find stuff like that easy to understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  blinked then relaxed, closing her eyes. “In any case, I’m probably  boring you. I don’t want to be the sort of person who goes on and on  and on about this stuff…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “No. It’s… interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Interesting?” Momomi frowned. <em>Did I hear that right?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  to be more precise… it’s hard to understand. It was obvious that Kenjou  had fallen for you, but she was slow to act on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. But when I think about it, it’s also out of character for Kenjou to fall for you at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi pouted. “Well, thanks for the vote of confidence there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  Kenjou I knew was antisocial, violent and completely disinterested in  other people. For her to find you so important… perhaps I misjudged her  somewhat.” Amane shrugged. “But I don’t think that’s down to the power  of love. What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not like she was an  antisocial freak one moment and enjoying my company the next. It’s more  of a gradual change, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So when did this start?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  frowned. “You know, I can’t exactly remember? A month ago, now? No,  maybe not even that long… it feels like that was a long time ago.” She  glanced at Amane and forestalled the next inevitably question. “Because  a lot changed in my life over that time, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane frowned.  She looked away again, but Momomi wasn’t fooled. For once, she was  fully focused. “And during that time you had a confrontation with your  parents? That is what I recall.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s correct.” Momomi scowled  at the formal language she’d slipped into. “I mean, yeah. They wanted  to take me away from the school, and I didn’t want to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?”  Amane looked at her steadily. “You had no friends, poor attendance and  effort records and had been sent here as a punishment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since when did you know this much about me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was forced to know things about Kenjou.” Amane looked away. “Well? Surely that was a dangerous move…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  tired of being lead,” Momomi complained. “Why don’t you say what you  think, already? It’s not like you’re doing anything but forcing me that  way…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shrugged. “I know it was because of Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi flushed. <em>Admitting  that between ourselves is one thing, but it’s completely different when  Amane is saying that as if she can read me like a book or something. </em>“Well…  you shouldn’t be so dramatic… half of it was the principle of the  thing, you know. I wanted to prove my independence. And for Amane, as  well, one of her chief motivations was to screw over my father because  he was rich. We weren’t very close at that time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned.  “I see. But still, you went a long way for idealism. Especially when  you sacrificed a life of relative ease in the process.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged. “Well, you know it as well, don’t you? The frustration of  being bound and indebted to people who want to control you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah. The difference, though, is that you resisted. And I’m not an expert, but my impression was you did not enjoy those days…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  fine. My friendship with Kaname was a factor as well; I’ll admit that.  But it was different for both of us because neither of us had ever had  any real friends before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane just nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>She understands. Of course she would. She is an Olesa without an Amiki. </em>“So  it wasn’t really anything to do with romance then. That’s how I see it,  anyway.” She smiled. “Love at first sight just sounds kinda stupid,  doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Amane finished her breakfast and put the tray aside. “But it’s still a curiosity to me. What do you see in Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “Oh, come on. I managed a half-answer to that one already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane folded her hands in her lap and looked away moodily. “Please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  fine. But even if you insult her all the time, she isn’t a bad person…”  Momomi scratched her cheek. “No, actually, she may well be a bad  person. But that’s not the point. She’s good for me and to me, if you  know what I mean. That’s enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t follow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  how do you say it? She’ll protect me, even if she’s violent. And she  cares for me, even if she’s antisocial. And because she doesn’t like a  lot of people, I can value the fact that she cares for me even more.  She doesn’t always have the best way of showing it and she can find it  hard to express herself, she’s dishonest and evasive and oblivious of  my feelings and her own… but I can see past all hat, and I know she’s  kind to me. She tries hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned.  “Yeah, I sounded like an idiot again. Look, don’t ask me for a third  time, okay? It’s not something I can put into words, but trust me, it  makes sense, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “No. It sounds enjoyable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  glanced at her, limps curling slightly. “Oh? Do you think you want to  try having a girlfriend after all? You have a lot of potential  candidates, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. You’re hopeless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Unless I aspired to it, it would be meaningless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  snorted. “Why? You could still grow into it, you know. Or else seduce a  senpai. It’s not like you wouldn’t be able to do it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it  sounds like this is as I said before. Your love is a dream about  another person.” Amane frowned, looking philosophical. “No, perhaps  not. The pleasure you derive from her company, that love, is the reward  for the dream, akin to money, power or fame. And the dream itself is  your aspiration to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re a closet romantic, aren’t you?  That’s pretty surprising.” Momomi laughed. “But still, you don’t need  to make things sound so dramatic. She’s just fun to be around, and… I  don’t know… things feel better like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t that the same thing in different words?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  exactly,” Momomi replied evasively. “Besides, love is a bad word.  Everyone knows thirteen year-olds are too stupid to fall in love, but  they put it in emo poetry. I like her, okay? If she’s still grappling  with that she isn’t ready for the stronger l-word, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By the sounds of it, neither are you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi bit back a sarcastic reply. “No. I suppose you’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane  played with the grass. “But still, it’s a wonderful thing. To have that  kind of conviction, something that can move even Kenjou one way or the  other, and demonstrate her more pleasant side…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehh… I suppose so.” Momomi frowned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you before. I lack those things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does that upset you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane shook her head. “I see enough from here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can assure you, that isn’t the same as experiencing it…” Momomi gave  her a strange look. “Well, it’s odd to think about, but actually,  that’s true. You’re often surrounded by people, but still, you’re  always alone. Right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane’s eyes were cold for a moment, and then she turned to regard an innocent tree. “What are you going to do now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Another change of conversation. </em>Momomi  cocked her head, considering. “Well, to be honest, it was more of a  hopeful maybe, so I’m just getting over-enthusiastic. But we’re going  on a date tomorrow and seeing how things go. That reminds me, I won’t  be able to visit tomorrow. After that, I… I’ve got no idea. We’ll just  see how things turn out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi scowled. “What? Anything wrong with that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. It’s just… uncreative.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s also tried and tested, you know. That sounds good to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bumbling  around in the dark, trusting in feelings, never planning and always  relying on everything to turn out well because you hope they will…  isn’t that stupid?” Amane shrugged. “If I was you, I’d at least try to  know where it was I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, with real people you can’t  exactly plan and prod them around like chess pieces. They’re not that  simple to deal with.” Momomi folded her arms. “Not Kaname, anyway.  Right now, when her feelings are still uncertain, it’s better to let  things run on. Then I can see where I stand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane made a  doubtful sound. “And what of each case? And what of your intentions?  There are many kinds of romantic relationship, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I don’t know, do I? Whatever works for us, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Two  people can think about the same thing in a different way.” Amane folded  her arms. “Dreams are good. I acknowledge as much. But like other  ambitions, your tactics were important in coming this far. You don’t  have to have a happy ending.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi huffed irritably. “Oh, what  do you know about it? We just go with what works, and it has worked. If  it falls down, we can worry then. But you’re no one with any right to  lecture me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane looked at the ground. “I suppose not. But for an Ohtori, it would be illogical to carry on without thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, looking at her thoughtfully. “You’re surprisingly cold and cynical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think. A lot.” Amane closed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  these thoughts? Are they punishment for my own probes?” Momomi prodded  her. “You don’t make a lot of sense to me, Amane-san. You’re very  enthusiastic about love and dreams, but cynical about their outcome.  And you appear to envy me my company, but when I call you on that, you  attack me for my lack of foresight…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane smiled and chuckled slightly. “Well, I’m a strange person. I’m sure you can forgive me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. <em>And strike three. Damnit, is she still screwing with my head?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  still, it doesn’t hurt to be cautious, now does it?” Amane shrugged.  “It doesn’t sound smart to stop thinking just yet. Kenjou, too, is a  strange person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As am I. Fine. I take your point, even if it  bursts my romantic little bubble. But don’t make too much of this,  either. You don’t know much about the two of us, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane checked her watch. “Hadn’t you better eat your breakfast now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked down, blinked, then shot up. “Damnit! I stayed too long again!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane chuckled gently. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ooh, Kaname’s going to be furious…” Momomi mused, ignoring the unusual sound. “Sorry, but I have to go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No. It’s fine.” Amane looked up. “But can I ask for a favour?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sure,” Momomi replied uncertainly. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane stood and brushed herself off. “Can I come with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stared for a long moment. “What? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does that matter?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gave her a very suspicious look, then shrugged and turned away. “Well, I can hardly say no, now can I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.” Amane followed her, leaving the horse’s paddock and heading towards the main building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi lead the way, feeling uneasy. <em>What are you thinking, Amane Ohtori? Just who are you, and what do you want in return for this devil’s pact? </em>She snorted. <em>That’s poetry. But more pertinently, what the hell are you going to tell Kaname?</em></span></p>
