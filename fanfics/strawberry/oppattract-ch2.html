The air was tense, full of anticipation, anxiety and fear. Hikari, who 
was still sitting on hear seat was shaking as she waited for the Raven 
haired girl&#39;s response. She looked at her and didn&#39;t dare look away, no 
matter how much she felt like running away right then and girl&#39;s poker 
face didn&#39;t help her one bit. But just when she thought she was going to 
die, she saw the girl crack a tiny smile and bended over.

The was a large amount, not to mention very audible, gasps from the 
other remaining students. They were shocked as they watched their &quot;class 
delinquent&quot; lean forward towards their &quot;transfer student&quot;. They watched 
as she raises a hand and gently touches Hikari&#39;s left cheek. And their 
eyes almost bulge out when they thought that Nanto Yaya was going to 
kiss the new blonde girl.

Their cheeks meet and Hikari blushed deeply as she felt the Raven haired 
girl&#39;s warmth. She didn&#39;t move, not an inch. She was petrified in 
confusion. A part of her wanted this to be a good thing and the other 
part said she&#39;s going to regret praying to meet her again.

To her surprise, the girl gently blew air into her ear. A soft and 
surprised &quot;Ah!&quot; escaped her as she felt the short stream of warm air 
graze her skin.

&quot;hehe...&quot; the raven haired girl giggled softly still touching her cheek 
and holding her head beside hers. And said in a incredibly soft, 
taunting and teasing tone; &quot;It&#39;s pleasure to meet you, Hikari.&quot;

Hikari swallowed quite audibly. She wasn&#39;t used to anyone calling her 
that. It made her feel very anxious, and yet at the same time oddly and 
incredibly happy, as well as a little confused. She was about to say 
something, but Yaya had beaten her to it. And said; &quot;Come with me.&quot; In a 
slightly more forceful yet still soft voice. She stands up straight, 
takes the blonde girl&#39;s hand and pulls her out of her own seat. Everyone 
else could only watch as their new classmate was dragged out of the 
room, stunned with the very sudden and odd set of events.

Hikari allowed the raven haired girl to lead her, she dared not struggle 
or make any noise to provoke or annoy the rumored delinquent. She 
believed that I she did, what ever awaited her would be longer and much 
worse that what the other girl already had in store for her. She was 
just glad that she had already packed her things into her bag and had 
her other hand on it before she was... abducted. But she obliged a small 
thought, that believed that this girl waited for her to finish packing 
everything she had... the question was &#39;why?&#39;.

Yaya lead her out of the school, still had in hand. Many of the girls&#39; 
eyes were on the poor blonde girl. The sent out silent prayers and 
&#39;don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll call the teachers&#39; look to her. All of which didn&#39;t 
make her feel any better of her situation. She was surprised that the 
raven haired girl had not yet brought her to the forest or anywhere no 
one else could see them and do all those unspeakable things that she 
imagined a delinquent student would do.

She was even more surprised when the girl, who she had just noticed was 
nearly a head taller than her, had brought her to a populated building. 
Except this one had students from at least two other schools in the 
building. And to no surprise no one tried to or bothered to help her get 
away from the raven haired girl. As she was lead up to the second floor, 
she noticed a number of students quickly entering their rooms or 
re-entering their rooms, some just looked down and covered their face or 
some pretended not to see them. Hikari&#39;s bad feeling was starting to get 
worse at this point.

A few moments later, the taller girl stopped. Hikari noticed they were 
in front of a door, the same one that her captor had just opened and 
dragged her into. Hikari&#39;s heart began to race faster, and she could 
really feel it pounding the moment she heard the door closed and lock 
clicked.

She was surprised that the amber eyed girl turned to her, relieved her 
of her bag tossing it down to one of the two beds in the room. And even 
more surprised when she felt the taller girl&#39;s other hand landed on her 
waist and ran towards her back. Yaya&#39;s other hand came and caressed her 
cheek, which would have caused her to blush if only her heart wasn&#39;t 
pumping so much blood everywhere that already made her incredibly red 
faced.

&quot;Wha-wa-what...?&quot; Hikari stuttered, finding it incredibly hard to say a 
word much less defend herself.

&quot;hmmm...&quot; was the Yaya&#39;s only response as she lightly caressed the 
girl&#39;s behind. This caused the innocent blonde to gasp and moan in 
confusion. She tried to wriggle her way off the raven haired girl&#39;s 
hands, but she was beginning to think the girl was really experienced at 
this and wouldn&#39;t let her escape.

&quot;Huh?!&quot; She let out as she felt one of the girl&#39;s hands enter her 
pocket, she tickled and rubbed the side of her thigh from her pocket in 
the most exotic way she thought possible. At that moment she didn&#39;t feel 
like resisting her anymore. And though her mind screamed at her telling 
her to get away from this delinquent girl, the rest of Hikari was 
beginning to enjoy the experience and didn&#39;t want to leave. But that 
soon ended...

She felt something being taken from her pocket, but that was soon pushed 
out of her mind when the taller girl suddenly grabbed her hands and 
forced them behind her. She soon realized that a soft but sturdy fabric 
was now holding her hands behind her back. She tries to struggle free of 
the binding but was surprised when she is pushed down gently towards the 
empty bed.

&quot;AHHH!!&quot; Hikari screamed. &quot;What... Why are y...&quot; She was about to ask 
the girl her reason for her abuse, but stopped when she had realized 
that the tall amber eyed raven haired girl had jumped got on the bed too 
and had set herself gently on Hikari&#39;s left side and the bed with their 
faces were only inches apart. &#39;Lilac flowers again...&#39; she said to 
herself remembering that it was the raven haired girl&#39;s scent. She found 
that the way the girl looked at her made her freeze, in an almost 
hypnotic sense.

Yaya smiled at the blonde girl, quite happy of her handy work. She 
skillfully placed her right arm under Hikari&#39;s neck which she used to 
hold the girl in place and allowed her hand rather to explore the blonde 
girl&#39;s upper body. She does not bother taking off any of the girl&#39;s 
clothes, she just passes her hands under them. Her right hand soon finds 
itself on Hikari&#39;s right breast. She lightly caresses her skin, very 
softly massaging and squeezing her soft delicate flesh and lightly 
pinching Hikari&#39;s right nipple. Her other hand was already under her 
skirt and was very gently teasing her thighs and enjoying the feel of 
the blonde girl&#39;s smooth silky skin.

Hikari couldn&#39;t help but moan at Yaya&#39;s ministrations. She felt quite 
confused and disoriented with what was being done to her. Confused 
because she didn&#39;t know why and what was happening to her and 
disoriented because she was beginning to like it. She closed her eyes 
hoping that would help her in anyway. But all it did was made all the 
more feel the pleasurable caresses of her captor.

It was then that Yaya took as her signal to continue even further. She 
kisses the girl&#39;s cheek trailing kisses till she reaches her ear. 
&quot;...that&#39;s it Hikari, just relax... I&#39;ll take care of you...&quot; she 
whispered before she kissed, licked and sucked on her earlobe. Hikari 
gasped sharply at the new wet wave of pleasure that Yaya&#39;s lips had 
introduced to her. She squirms a little on instinct but it was nothing 
that could possibly free her.

Yaya then swiftly moves her left hand under Hikari&#39;s rather warm and 
lightly moist panties. She traced the girls folds and gently caressed 
her most precious parts. At this point Hikari was about to make sense of 
what was happening to her. Though her assaulter was a girl as well, she 
realized that this girl was going to have her way with her... but 
judging the way she was going on with it didn&#39;t seem so bad for Hikari 
at this point. The girl was very gently with her, she clearly knows what 
she&#39;s doing and she made her feel quite comfortable, right where she 
was.

Yaya lightly insert&#39;s an inch of her middle finger between Hikari&#39;s 
folds. The blonde girl&#39;s sexual fluids helped getting it in; quickly, 
gently and painlessly. Hikari&#39;s eyes suddenly opened when the taller 
girl&#39;s finger began dancing inside her. The sensation aroused her to new 
levels that the room looked a few shades of red darker.

And just when she was really beginning to enjoy loosing herself in the 
pleasure given to her, her eye notices the other empty bed where her bag 
was now laying on. Her mind raced to negate the state of pleasure her 
mind and body was in, telling her that she could be seen by someone 
other than her raven haired assaulter... namely the raven haired 
assaulter&#39;s roommate. She panicked a little and tried to get free of the 
taller girl&#39;s grasps. She first took the girl&#39;s left hand which was 
still digging around her wet very wet mine.

&quot;Please stop!&quot; She begged her as she tried to pull the girl&#39;s hand away 
from her crotch.

Yaya who was still teasing her ear, stopped for a moment to seductively 
ask; &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Wait! Your roommate might see us.&quot; She stated, and hoped the other girl 
would listen to her pleas.

The raven haired girl was surprisingly dumbfounded. She was expecting 
the girl to ask her to stop sooner or later, but for some reason she 
what the blonde girl had just said had not crossed her mind. She allows 
the girl to take of her hand away, but not without one last wet dip 
inside that cause the girl to moan quite loudly.

Yaya softly and seductively giggled into Hikari&#39;s ear and said; &quot;No need 
to worry about that... I am with my roommate.&quot;

&quot;Eh?!&quot; Hikari asked dumbfounded by her words, turning her head to meet 
the raven haired girl face to face. It chilled her to see a smile on the 
other girl&#39;s face. And she was completely stunned when she noticed the 
girl raised up her left hand and popped her middle finger into her 
mouth, the very same one that had been touching her in her deep 
privates. She blushed deeply as she watched the raven haired girl suckle 
a little on her own finger with a look of delight that told her; 
&quot;Delicious.&quot;. She felt oddly satisfied, though she didn&#39;t know why.

&quot;I like...&quot; Yaya was about to say something when the door&#39;s locks 
clicked. She immediately removed her hand from underneath the blonde 
girl&#39;s clothes and pulled down Hikari&#39;s skirt down again. She then 
lightly hugged the girl and did nothing more, which caused great 
confusion to Hikari.

The door loudly swung open and revealed their Homeroom teacher, who 
screamed out Yaya&#39;s family name; &quot;Nanto-kun!&quot;

The raven haired girl looked up at her teacher and said; &quot;What?&quot; with 
her old blas&eacute; gaze and tone.

Misato glared at her &#39;difficult&#39; student with an accusing look. She was 
beginning to think that this was a bad idea, especially since said 
&#39;difficult&#39; student was nearly impossible to manipulate or convince into 
doing something she doesn&#39;t want. Also seeing how quickly the new girl 
was falling into her hands, and right now, it didn&#39;t seem like she 
wanted to let go of Hikari. She released a sigh and closed the door 
behind her, deciding not to indulge the other students&#39; curiosity. 
&quot;Nanto-kun... do you have to sexually harass your new roommate already?&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot; Yaya replied very offhandedly. She looked at Misato but 
avoided letting her gaze fall on Hikari.

Misato folded her arms and looked at Yaya very smugly, and though she 
knew Yaya wasn&#39;t affected by such tactics and adult pressure she still 
did so out of habit. &quot;Then why are you?&quot; she asked rather upset and 
growing very annoyed.

&quot;Can you prove it?&quot; Yaya asked almost absently.

&quot;This room smells like sex!&quot; Misato yelled out, rather irritably as Yaya 
noted when she saw her teacher&#39;s left eye brows twitch.

&quot;I am a teenager you know... It could be just hormones.&quot; retorted the 
raven haired girl. Though there was no life in her argument it was very 
plausible and logical.

Misato not wanting to be out done decided to argue; &quot;AH! No way! You&#39;re 
barely in your room enough to make it plausible and you are the last 
person I&#39;d even think who&#39;d have hormones! Pheromones! Maybe...&quot; She 
slaps herself on her cheek when she had realized that her argument was 
childish and idiotic... especially as a teacher.

Yaya however just shrugged her victory, like it had no meaning and said 
to her; &quot;I don&#39;t see the difference, but... ok... my room reeks of my 
Pheromones then...&quot; but then a tiny smug smile appeared on the raven 
haired girl&#39;s lips as a thought to annoy her homeroom teacher suddenly 
came into her mind.

&quot;You&#39;re not attracted to my Pheromones are you? Sensei?&quot; Said Yaya, 
mentioning &#39;Sensei&#39; in an almost sarcastically annoying tone that she 
was very sure would get on her teacher&#39;s nerves.

And as she expected Misato explodes, yelling out to her; &quot;WHAT ARE YOU 
IMPLYING BY THAT?!&quot;

&quot;It was an innocent question. Sensei.&quot; Yaya said politely sarcastic.

&quot;There is nothing innocent when you&#39;re involved!&quot; her teacher argued 
angrily as she gave her annoying student an angry leer. Which Yaya 
decided to answer by just laughing.

Misato grumbles and was about say something when Yaya suddenly sat up 
with Hikari, who she had sat in front of her. &quot;Anyway... why are you 
here Katsuragi? I thought you said you&#39;d leave everything she needed to 
me?&quot; she said as she hugged Hikari, whose arms were still bound behind 
her back.

Hikari on the other hand was trying to make sense of the situation. What 
she gathered so far was that; &#39;Delinquent&#39; girl Nanto Yaya was now her 
roommate, not to mention classmate and seatmate. Nice homeroom teacher 
seems less nicer now that she had learned she was left in the 
&#39;Delinquent&#39; girl&#39;s care. What she didn&#39;t know was &#39;why did the girl do 
that too her?&#39;

&quot;I had a change of heart... when your classmates told me that you 
dragged her back into your room, I had a bad feeling.&quot; Misato gave Yaya 
a bad look, which Yaya ignored and Hikari felt instead.

&quot;Oh?...&quot; Yaya began undoing the knot she had tied using the fabric from 
the girl&#39;s pocket. &#39;hmm?&#39; she thought as she saw the red handkerchief.

&quot;And I see that I was right.&quot; said Misato to the raven haired girl as 
she looked at her accusingly.

And with a nonchalant tone Yaya replied; &quot;Maybe...&quot;

Misato let out a sigh. She then turned her attention to Hikari. 
&quot;Konohana-san, I&#39;m sorry I put you in this situation. I&#39;ll get you out 
as soon as I can.&quot; The teacher reached for her student &quot;So if you&#39;d just 
fol...&quot; but before her hand reached the girl and before she could finish 
her sentence, Hikari decides to speak up.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. I would like to stay.&quot; She said in a soft confident 
voice.

&quot;WHAAAT?!&quot; yelled their teacher who was shocked beyond reason.

But the only response from Yaya was a soft pleased &quot;hmmm...&quot; which was 
barely heard by the teacher.

&quot;I&#39;ll stay here with Nanto..AAH!&quot;

But before Hikari could finish that sentence, Yaya pulled her closer to 
herself. She hugged her from behind, lightly hanged her chin on the 
girl&#39;s neck and whispered in to her ear; &quot;You can call me Yaya.&quot; This 
caused Hikari to redden a few more shades. She was not used to this 
closeness or to calling someone by their first name without an 
honorific. She had managed to stutter out; &quot;I&#39;ll... stay here... with... 
Ya...ya-chan.&quot;

Misato&#39;s face was drained of all color thanks to the shock. Though she 
was hoping that someone someday would be able to tolerate this annoying 
girl, she was not expecting the shy new girl to try. But it&#39;s her fault 
that this turn out like this, and now she&#39;s powerless to rectify it 
unless Hikari herself decides to leave. The shock wore off after a few 
moments and allowed Misato to ask her student if she was sure of her 
decision.

&quot;Yes...&quot; Hikari answered immediately.

&quot;Are you absolutely sure Konohana-san? This girl could take advantage of 
you, toy with you, force you to do things you wouldn&#39;t usually do and so 
much more...&quot;

Yaya just rolls her eyes, hoping that Misato had seen it... knowing well 
that it really ticks her off, which almost works, but unfortunately for 
Yaya Misato decides to ignore her for now. Instead she focuses on trying 
to convince the shy girl to want to leave this room and this girl.

Hikari looks at her new roommate, who head was still in between her 
shoulder and her neck, not to mention still hugging her from behind. 
Yaya was just giving their teacher an &#39;I don&#39;t care&#39; look when she 
notices the blonde haired girl&#39;s movement and looks at her as well. 
Hikari blushes a little at the sight of the raven haired girl&#39;s Amber 
eyes, for a moment they looked like mirrors that showed her deepest 
desire... and it was this girl, the same one holding her.

And without a second thought she looks at her teacher and says; &quot;I&#39;m 
sure.&quot;

Misato frowns, and begins fearing the worst. She looks at Yaya who just 
looked at her blankly without saying a thing, which in her book is a 
weird thing. &quot;Not going to gloat Nanto-kun?&quot; she asked the girl almost 
angrily.

&quot;Why?...&quot; asked Yaya who seemed almost bored.

&quot;You did something to make her stay... aren&#39;t you going to say something 
smart and annoy me some more before I leave?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t look at me... I&#39;m as surprised as you are...&quot; she revealed. It 
was true that Yaya was not expecting Hikari to decide to stay. In fact, 
she actually did what she did to scare the girl and make her ask the 
teacher to move her with someone else. And although she was ready if the 
girl decided to do other wise... but still she was expecting the girl to 
scream and run away as soon as she started going to far. But in the end, 
since the girl had decided to stay... she&#39;ll find ways to make things 
interesting for the both of them.

&quot;Huh?&quot; her teacher gave them a dumbfounded look.

Hikari herself felt confused too, she was sort of expecting the raven 
haired girl to do something by now... And a few seconds later she was 
right. She felt one of Yaya&#39;s hands move from embracing her, it rose 
till it reached her face, it cupped her cheek and turned her towards the 
other girl&#39;s face. Yaya was starting at her, in away that sent shivers 
down her spine... in a good way.

Yaya then said; &quot;Welcome to the Strawberry Dorms, Hikari.&quot; in a sweet 
and seductive way.

Hikari would have blushed, but she was doing so already. The girl&#39;s 
welcome to her was heart felt and left her this warm and fuzzy feeling 
all over her body. And just when she though it couldn&#39;t get any 
better... Yaya leans forward and kisses her.

&quot;NANTO!!!&quot; their teacher yelled at her.

But the delinquent girl ignored her, she focuses on the kiss she was 
giving. Softly kissing, licking and suckling on Hikari&#39;s lips. It 
pleased her to hear and feel Hikari&#39;s moan vibrate thru their lips and 
tongues. She so far was enjoying how submissive Hikari has been.

It was Hikari&#39;s first kiss. And she loved it. It didn&#39;t matter to her 
that Yaya seemed so much more experienced than her. Who she did it with 
before, how many she did it with before, or since when... didn&#39;t matter 
to her. The strong and tight hold the girl had of her, the dominating 
feel that she was giving off, the feeling that she&#39;ll never know what&#39;s 
going to happen... thrilled her.

Yaya soon broke the kiss, wiping of a trickle of saliva that dared 
dribble down from Hikari&#39;s lips. The blonde girl was out of breath and 
was panting heavily as soon as their lips had parted. She noticed a 
satisfied smile on Yaya&#39;s lips that soon disappeared behind her 
challenging expression.

The delinquent looks at their teacher who was surprisingly red with a 
hard bright blush across her face.

&quot;Do you mind? We&#39;d like some privacy...&quot; Yaya said in a very demanding 
tone.

Misato lets out a deep sigh in defeat. She the looks at Hikari and says; 
&quot;If you change your mind come see me. Ok? Hikari?&quot;

Hikari only smiled at the teacher&#39;s request, not wanting to let Yaya 
think one bit that she&#39;d consider leaving any time soon. They watched 
her leave the room. Hikari still in Yaya&#39;s arms, cause a little uproar 
from the students that was able to take a peak from the opening that 
Misato had made on the door on her way out. That caused the blonde 
haired girl to blush a bit, thinking that she&#39;ll never hear the end of 
it starting tomorrow.

&quot;Well... since you&#39;re staying I suppose I should help you settle in....&quot; 
Yaya said blandly as she looks at Hikari, &quot;Let&#39;s get you some uniforms 
and living supplies at the store.&quot; Yaya said as she let go of her hold 
of Hikari and got off the bed.

Hikari stood and took her wallet from her bag, and was about to reach 
for the door. But then suddenly Yaya wrapped her arms around her again 
and pulled her very close to her, and held her tightly. Then using the 
side of her head, Yaya bushed away Hikari&#39;s hair away from her ears.

&quot;Are you sure about this? Hikari?... I&#39;m not a very good person...&quot; Yaya 
whispered to her.

&quot;Yes. I&#39;m sure.&quot; Hikari quickly responded, without a second thought.

And with a smile creeping up on her lips Yaya. She didn&#39;t know why the 
girl wanted to stay... but if she had to take a guess, the girl had a 
crush on her... and as conceited as that sounded it was the only thing 
she could think of. Hiding those thoughts away for now with a blas&eacute; 
voice she replied; &quot;Okay...&quot;</pre>
