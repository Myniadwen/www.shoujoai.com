----------

She stood in the open doorway, the air currents beckoning her into the 
interior and promising of springtime. She stepped haltingly forward, 
eyes glancing over the half-inhabited room. The lone window&#146;s curtain 
fluffed lazily in the breeze.

She knew immediately which side of the room was hers. While one side was 
clearly inhabited, her own was blank and sterile. The bed lacked sheets, 
the walls were bare, and the desk lacking in books and paper. The dearth 
of life to her side of the room made her shiver suddenly, a cold feeling 
stealing up on her even as the sun glared brightly just beyond the open 
window panes.

It was strange to be standing there, so painfully poised on the 
threshold. So strange for her, to be looking into an unfamiliar room in 
an unfamiliar school. At seventeen, she was not supposed to be carrying 
suitcases into alien dormitory rooms. At seventeen, she was not supposed 
to be preparing to meet a new room-mate.

But, here she was, her footsteps bringing her further into this new 
world. And now her suitcases were set down quietly by her bare bed, and 
she looked out the window to see her new view. Cherryblossom trees 
clustered nearby, leaving a thick coating of decaying petals upon the 
ground. In the distance, the cathedral stood harshly against the 
landscape. And above the sky so blue it almost hurt to behold.

She turned her eyes from the postcard view, and let herself uneasily 
down on the edge of the bed. The other side of the room screamed at her, 
seemingly demanding attention, demanding it be noticed instead of the 
abandoned half. Garishly colored posters were set haphazardly against 
the wall, and a litany of stuffed creatures crowded the pink-sheeted 
bed. The desk itself had untidy stacks of notebooks and textbooks 
littering its surface, and half-closed drawers with pencils protruding 
from their depths. Finally, against this mess, a framed photograph sat 
precariously near the edge. Its solemn black-and-white tones seemed at 
odds with the scene it depicted &#150; a girl, somewhat heavily made-up, arm 
hooked through the arm of a boy, leaning fully into him, face partially 
crushed against his chest and wide grins upon both her and his 
countenances. Directly underneath the picture frame was a letter, only 
the final lines of which were visible &#150; &quot;Miss you, Haruhime! Love, 
Daisuke.&quot;

There was a black-and-white photograph, too, in her own luggage. But it 
was a photograph seemingly destined to find itself tucked under the 
mattress, far from eyes, as opposed to so blatantly displayed. As it 
was, it had arrived at Astraea Hill tucked firmly near the bottom of her 
smaller suitcase, facedown against the gray lining. The presence of her 
own room-mate&#146;s giddy photograph had prompted her first thought of it 
since she had tossed it there.

&quot;Yukizawa-san, I presume?&quot;

The voice, with its clipped edges, brought her out of her reverie, and 
she now stood, turned towards the door. Her own voice, when it came, was 
somewhat bland, &quot;Yukizawa Fuyuko. Pleased to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Kajiura Haruhime &#150; likewise.&quot;

The other girl, though, stood in the doorframe, scrutinizing Fuyuko. 
When she tossed her head suddenly, reflexively, it was clear her 
judgment had been passed. She passed fully into the room now, and made 
her way fluidly to her wreck of a desk. She looked once more at Fuyuko 
before she sat down, and then spoke with her back turned &quot;I miss my 
room-mate dearly &#150; she is ailing.&quot;

There was a pause.

&quot;And you are not her.&quot;

A burst of wind curled the drapes, and Fuyuko let loose a breath she had 
not known was held. And, thus, her tenth year of schooling began.</pre>
