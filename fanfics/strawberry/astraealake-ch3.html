<p>Kaname drifted  gradually into consciousness. She rolled over in bed, looking up to  find Momomi in front of the mirror, brushing her hair. The girl was  toying with it, moving the brush too and fro, and watching herself  hawkishly. “What are you doing?” she asked. </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced round irritably. “I’m brushing my hair, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How long have you been doing that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m not sure. Unlike you, I take pride in my appearance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted, sitting up and throwing off the covers. “I can’t say there’s much to take pride in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s silly,” Kaname said. “You’re just a girl of thirteen. Why bother now? Why bother anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  was taught good habits, albeit by stupid people,” Momomi said.  “Appearance counts for a lot in this school, it seems. I mean, it’s an  unwritten law that the Etoiles have to be beautiful people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Running for Etoile, now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  be ridiculous,” Momomi said. “If I can’t afford to make friends, for my  reasons, then I certainly can’t afford to commit to that. Besides, I’d  need a partner, which I lack, and patience with an awful lot of work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why bother? I wouldn’t understand even in a mixed school, but that’d make more sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  not bother?” Momomi asked. “You’re not ugly, but you’re always so  beaten up that you look it. And you’ve got lovely hair, but you keep it  too short. It’s like someone attacked it with a pair of shears. You  should look after yourself more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Believe me, I’ve never  bothered with that,” Kaname said. “I learned bad habits from stupid  people, and I’m not inclined to change now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a waste,” Momomi said. “But really, you should just get into less fights.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  stood and walked across the room, pulling out her school uniform and  dressing. “You say that. But it’s like me telling you not to deceive  people at the drop of a hat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No matter how badly my plans go wrong, I rarely get physically harmed,” Momomi said. “You should try living like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t mind a little pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  should,” Momomi said. “If someone breaks your nose properly, then it’d  stay twisted. You have a passable nose right now, so quit while you’re  ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged her jacket on. “Around here? None of  these girls can fight. It’s almost funny, and almost depressing, when  one girl with a rudimentary knowledge of street fighting and martial  arts can dominate like this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can always get unlucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even then, I don’t care about my appearance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should,” Momomi sighed. “These things are important. It pains me to see you waste yourself like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  makes you so centric on appearances, though?” Kaname asked. “I’ve  noticed that before in you. You’re pretty, granted. But don’t get too  big headed. Your hair makes you look like a kid, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My family takes pride in appearances,” Momomi said. “On so many levels, our lives are nothing but appearances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which is why you’re such a bald liar, I suppose,” Kaname said. “You see, my parents didn’t lie. They just broke things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lies  are almost as bad,” Momomi said. “Sometimes worse. But your parents  made you strong, and mine made me cunning. Of course, neither of them  made friends with us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname adjusted her necktie without paying  much attention, then walked to the dress, picking up her brush and  running it roughly through her hair. “But really, if you hate your  parents so much, why do you bother with the whole appearances thing?  I’d say a better way to rebel would be to <em>not </em>do what they tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you still fight,” Momomi said. “It only makes sense to use the talents  you’ve been handed, regardless of who gave you them. Besides, this was  half as much taught by my sister.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sister? You’ve never talked much about her…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, you’re so coarse about it,” Momomi said, as Kaname put her brush down and made to walk away. “Come here! I’ll do it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  sighed and sat, facing the mirror steadily while the brown-haired girl  began to fuss with her hair. “Your sister taught you,” she prompted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  taught me a lot about how to look beautiful,” Momomi said. “She’s  sixteen now, I guess. I haven’t seen her in… what, eight months? She’s  a very, very beautiful girl, and much admired. She can’t stand our  parents, of course, but she seems to like the ballroom lifestyle.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A sibling,” Kaname said. “You’re lucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess I am,” Momomi admitted. “But if you have something, you can lose  it. Like I said, I haven’t seen her in eight months. She’s the only  person from my family that I miss.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t imagine I’d like her very much,” Kaname said. “An aristocratic little twit, only older than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  you’d probably hate her,” Momomi said, running a hand through Kaname’s  hair and twisting out a knot. “That’s one of the reasons why I like  her. But she was good to me. She’d fix my hair for me, just like I’m  doing now… those were some of the few times when I could feel happy at  home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s nice,” Kaname said. “Very cute. Is she a deceitful girl like you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  very,” Momomi said. “But she didn’t lie to me. Much. And I didn’t lie  to her much, either. We often had to cover each other about our  parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re all the same, you rich girls,” Kaname said. “Hopeless. But we’re really opposites, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I envy you, in a way,” Momomi said. “I think I’d far prefer it if I had nothing to go back to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I have <em>something</em>,” Kaname said. “It’s just a horrible place, and a worse mother. But believe me. Don’t wish poverty on yourself, it’s not fun”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  the thing, though,” Momomi said. “I can’t really stand my life. I  should be grateful. But it’s quite a lot of work, keeping up  appearances, that deception. Socialising with people you can’t stand.  Keeping the right manner all the time. And <em>balls. </em>I hate balls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That explains why you look after your appearance in a girl’s school,” Kaname said, deadpan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi poked her on the nose. “Girls our age aren’t even supposed to know about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At this school? It’s hard <em>not </em>to,”  Kaname said. “You have to look around, nothing more. Kissing, dating,  and god knows what else. I sometimes they suspect they’ve got some way  of picking us out, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I meant… never mind… and why <em>us</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s an over-suspicious mind you’ve got that,” Kaname said. “Like you said, we’re too young.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  way you talk, I doubt that,” Momomi said. “And… where was I, anyway?  Balls! I mean, dancing. Eating canapés. Making polite conversation.  Dressing up in frocks.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How… rich.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I hate it with  a passion,” Momomi said. “My sister, she likes that stuff. Me, I can’t  stand it. Really. Dancing with these young idiots, and having to talk  politely to everyone. And the food. It’s so… pressurising. I have to be  someone I’m not for hours on end.” She returned the comb to the  dresser, then leaned over Kaname’s shoulder and started fiddling with  her necktie. “Really, you should be more careful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not a  careful person,” Kaname said. “But regardless. I’m surprised that you,  of all people, would have difficulty maintaining a deception.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course not. But the problem is that the deception I must maintain is  really tiresome. Polite and pretty and dumb and useless. Really, I’m  generally only something just a little different from the real me, when  I lie. I’m not that great at deception, otherwise I’d be a really  popular, good girl who everyone loved. But that’s too tiring for me. I  can’t tell that kind of lie for long enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suspect that you’re lying as well as that,” Kaname said. “Momomi is excellent at hiding Momomi. Even I can’t see her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s good. She’s a very ugly girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that,” Kaname said. “In that she’s already an ugly girl to  society, and society determines beauty and ugliness. But I find society  itself a very ugly thing. People are stupid, narrow-minded, weak and  naturally vicious. So what’s beauty there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Well, I understand the relativism of beauty,” Momomi said. “I’ve experienced it myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “It’s very frustrating, you know, that my reserves of eloquence are entirely expended on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, normally you can only communicate with fists, nothing else,” Momomi said. “I guess my presence drags up your game.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hitting  you would be a waste of energy,” Kaname said. “I suspect you’re quite  proud of that fact. But you, too, have a knack for wasting those words  that could generate sympathy from someone on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think that’s  because you’re the only person truly ready to listen,” Momomi said,  “Whether you think so yourself or not. You’ll listen. There, done. You  look much better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not especially difficult,” Kaname noted. “Even I’ll admit I don’t usually look like much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’d be beautiful if only you looked after yourself,” Momomi said. “It’s very frustrating, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  gave her an odd glance. “Well, my beauty or lack thereof is  appropriate. It matches my personality, in the eyes of that society  that really doesn’t understand very much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We never wanted to, or let them, understand,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  they understood, they’d treat me even more badly,” Kaname said. “And in  your case, too… you’re never going to be friends with the hopeless,  nice ones. The ones who make victims- an aristocrat is something like  their dream. They’d extort you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d give them nothing,” Momomi said. “But even so. I do sometimes wonder whether we’re doing the right thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speak for you, and what you’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re fine like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded, standing and brushing herself off. “Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then I’ll carry on like this,” Momomi said. “That’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  touched her blue hair, walking behind Momomi and giving her a curious  look. “This is the thing, though, isn’t it?” she said. “Even if you do  my hair up nicely, I’ve still got nowhere to go on a Saturday. So it’s  wasted while I mope in my room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Momomi said. “I’m surprised you haven’t joined the marital arts club, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  did,” Kaname said. “Got thrown out after two months for excessive  violence. All the other clubs of interest to me banned me aforethought.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In first year? You must have been a terror, even then,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve never been happy here,” Kaname said. “Ironic when I chose to be here. But that’s how it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s who we’ll always be,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you, then?” Kaname said. “You’re a good liar. So join that damn ridiculous literature club or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  no time for that,” Momomi said. “I’m not going to rely on other people,  or let them rely on me. Nor am I going to waste time with people I  hate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re very melodramatic,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So are you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve explained my reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were very melodramatic then, as well,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  were you, as I recall,” Kaname said. “It’s not very important, though.  But if your story is as comprehensive as mine, then I’d be surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that <em>was </em>your  story,” Momomi mocked. “I thought it was just a story. But, truth my  story isn’t much. That’s important. No one forced me into this. I was  sent here, but I chose to stay here. And from here, I’m walking my own  path, wherever it takes me. The fact that I have something to go back  to… that’s the truth of my story. Far more than you, I could go back.  But I don’t want to, not yet. Despite the pain of it. I don’t care. I  need to do this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re being way too serious again,” Kaname said. “It creeps me out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t like it when people talk seriously, do you?” Momomi said. “It makes you uncomfortable. Laughing is easier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something like that,” Kaname conceded. “The less you have to laugh about, the more you need to laugh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That makes sense,” Momomi said, fighting slightly. “But… listen. Do you want to go somewhere?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  normally we either both loaf around here doing nothing much, or we  argue sufficiently for one or the other to leave,” Momomi said. “It’s  pretty pointless. But neither of us actually have anything to do. So  why don’t we just at least get some fresh air?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Together?” Kaname probed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked away. “Well, perhaps coincidentally alongside each other. Or  not. Or whatever. I don’t care really, but it seems pretty pathetic to  be so narrow as to do stay cooped up indoors. It makes us… me… look  like I’m afraid of something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. We can’t have that, now can we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname adjusted her jacket. “Okay, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh… yeah,” Momomi looked unsettled. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “That conversation had too many ehs in it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it’s not good for enemies to do this without thinking about it,” Momomi  said with affected hauteur, closing her eyes. “But once should be fine.  We won’t make a habit of it or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re cute when you’re in denial,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you talking about? Besides, you’re the same all the damn time!” she said, shaking her head furiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes,” Kaname said, walking past her and patting her on the head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damnit,”  Momomi said. “Right. Let’s go. Really. Even if I have to drag you. I  can’t stand this room right now.” She grabbed Kaname by the wrist,  pulling the girl roughly out the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ow,” Kaname said, retrieving her hand and rubbing it. “That hurt. Don’t make me break your neck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You wouldn’t bother to do that,” Momomi said. “Supposedly, I’m below you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, where are we going to go anyway?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah… eh…” Momomi blushed, staring at the opposite wall. “That is…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t tell me you haven’t even thought of that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  we could go watch Amane from the verges of the forest, like tragic  heroines,” Momomi said sharply. “You do that all the time. I’m sure I  could try one of your interests for-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grabbed her by the  neck, pushing her against the wall. “So you noticed that… you’re  description of it is so wrong it isn’t even funny. But if you breathe a  word-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gritted her teeth, trying to push the other girl away. “I don’t get you. If you hate her so, why do you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname! What are you doing to Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two girls turned and glared, then detached themselves. “Nothing to  worry about,” Kaname said. “Least of all you. Who are you, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blonde haired girl glared at them. “Toumori Shion! That’s Shion-senpai to you, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s a senpai doing wasting her time where she’s not wanted?” Momomi asked, ostensibly to Kaname.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  scowled. “You two… you’re hopeless. Everyone’s heard of you two. I  don’t know what you were doing, and I don’t want to. Just keep out of  my sight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll do what we want where we like,” Kaname said. “We don’t take orders from you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No doubt,” Shion said. “I’m wasting my time on two sad losers like you.” She walked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sad losers, hmm?” Kaname mused, placing a hand against the wall and watching her go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It has a nice ring to it,” Momomi said. “On her lips, it’s a compliment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know,” Shion said, pausing for a moment. “That’s the thing about you two that makes no sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  two are infamous for infighting,” Shion said. “But the moment anyone  outside steps in, you’ll talk and act as if you’re family or more than  that. It’s quite pathetic, really. You two are unreal. Living in your  own little world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And how about you?” Momomi asked. “Always alone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  better than you two,” Shion said, turning back, eyes flashing. “You say  that, too. You’re so bloody proud of it. But, really, you’re alone  together, which means nothing. You’re so insular.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’re  always alone, why did you intervene then?” Kaname asked. “You weren’t  wanted, and it’s hardly the actions of a truly asocial person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m still not going to take your kind of idiocy, alone or with others,” Shion said. “No way. It’s too stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You pay a lot of attention to two sad losers, a year below you,” Momomi said. “That’s quite interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?” Shion said. “Well, I have my reasons. You two have enormous potential. You waste it all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what’s that to you?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You,  and others like you, propagate the most pointless infighting,” Shion  said. “Miator. That’s whom we should be fighting. But they win because  people like you, intelligent if hopeless, waste your time. You should  be doing club activities, at least! You should compete, contribute, be  something more than useless burdens and embarrassments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  made you part of our student council?” Momomi asked. “I don’t think a  third year can tell us what Spica should be doing. It’s not like the  council cares.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s because the council’s incompetent,” Shion  said. “But if you’re too feckless enough to care, that’s no concern of  mine.” She turned away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The second years glanced at each other then watched her for a second. “Hey,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Shion asked without looking round.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Listen, we’re busy right now,” Momomi said. “But your rhetoric’s kinda cute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Talk to us at some point,” Kaname said. “Your bluntness about the council is worth something, at least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion turned for a moment, staring at them. “This is to disprove my point about you being insular, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, it’s because someone as cynical and vicious as that is really quite like us,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you have some manner of idealism as well,” Kaname said. “That’s your weak point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  the other thing I hate about you,” Shion said. “You both seem really  stupid and silent until you suddenly do that cross-talk act.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that was the most we’ve seen you talk ever, either,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll see you around,” Kaname completed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Whatever.” The third-year stalked away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Odd  girl,” Momomi said. “But I think I like her. You too, I guess, which is  why we did that. We’re probably making a mistake, of course.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suspect so,” Kaname said. “Do you know what I think it was, though?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  said we could contribute,” Kaname said. “She doesn’t even know us. It’s  ridiculous. And we say we don’t want to contribute. But it’s nice to be  told that. I guess she knows our weaknesses.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,”  Momomi said. “But I don’t think that’s her exploiting a weakness, she  lacks that kind of guile. No, she’s too… nice, for it. It’s pretty  stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever,” Kaname said. “It won’t come to anything. She’s no one anyway. I think she’s the one wasting potential.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anyway,” Momomi said. “Let’s just forget earlier, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bowed her head. “But don’t get me wrong. Amane’s my enemy. I watch her because of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Momomi said. “I hate her too. But, she’s very inactive. Really,  she doesn’t ever do anything much. I think you could just ignore her  quite happily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what irritates me, though. That she wastes herself like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, let’s be honest,” Momomi said. “As that Shion says, we’re not much different in that respect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re different,” Kaname said. “So unbelievably different… she’s annoyingly perfect. Unlike me, cut deep, she has no flaw.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t believe that,” Momomi said. “She holds herself aloof as we do.  There’s something there. A weakness. I’m not going to be taken in by  the act I myself use.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish I could believe that about her,” Kaname said. “But I’d only want to find out what that weakness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t take her so seriously,” Momomi said. “She’s only a girl. She’s not perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked out the window, eyes looking into some distance full of Amane.  “She’s close. Whatever I can do, she can do better. Except fight,  maybe, but against her that’s totally worthless. But she’s smarter than  I am, and prettier, and more controlled, and more talented- whatever I  do, I can’t beat her. If I know an unbeatable foe, I want to think  they’re perfect. If they’re not, that just reflects worse on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,  she’s not important,” Momomi said. “So she scores better on some tests.  Listen, her achievements mean nothing. She’s an Otori. Even my parents  have heard of them, and they’re unbelievably elitist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do they do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’re big in the medical world,” Momomi said vaguely. “I mean big. Huge. They’re aristocrats of the new school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?” Kaname said, interested. “I never bothered to look about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  that’s the point. Kaname Otori is an aristocrat, like me, born to  privilege and the best of everything. For her, having academic success  means nothing. Anyone, with the resources we posses, should do as  well.” Momomi looked at her. “Your achievements mean something. You’ve  come from nowhere, with no expectations, and got this far. That’s a  real achievement. A couple of marks… don’t be pathetic! You’re here!  You’re competing with Amane Otori! That’s incredible in itself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?” Kaname said, unconvinced.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,”  Momomi said. “Amane’s achievements mean nothing, never have done, never  will do. She doesn’t need them. She just has to be an Otori. You’ve  nothing but your talents. I’m almost jealous, I guess, that you do  something real with your talents. I feel like I’ve done nothing at all  with mine. Nothing that means anything, except as the path I was told  to walk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t be jealous of poverty,” Kaname said. “It’s irritating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But what I’ve done means something?” Kaname mused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Believe  me,” Momomi said. “If I look at you, and I look at Amane, I know who I  think has done more that really matters. I mean… her horse riding,  even. What does that mean? Fighting is inelegant, but it has meaning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s the thing about me, though,” Kaname said eventually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t accept your world,” Kaname said. “I’m not going to just take the  privilege of aristocrats, the way you see me as rising to your level,  and the concept that I should be proud just to catch up. I’m not here  to play. I’m playing to win. Whoever I’m up against, and however rich  they are, I’ll take them on and I’ll win. It’s always been that way,  until I got here. This place has me at my limit, but I can hold on.  Except Amane. She just wins, and I can’t accept that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see… well, I can understand that,” Momomi said. “If you do take things so seriously. But are you sure it’s just that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do you mean?” Kaname asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You pay an inordinate amount of attention to Amane,” Momomi said. “Even with respect to your given reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jealous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not especially. Just worried about you. You could get burned, flying to close to your sun,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  a pretty phrase. I’ll remember it.” Kaname shrugged. “But you’re  wasting your time worrying about me. I can handle myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s all very well to say,” Momomi grumbled. “But other people exist too, and it’s pretty painful to watch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t you paying an inordinate amount of attention to me, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You need someone to watch your back,” Momomi said. “You’ll never do it yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Beat Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  did say that? Just because it sounded cool? No, because I want that,  suddenly. I don’t understand, exactly, why I want to see her lose, when  I didn’t care before. To me, at least, Amane’s just some smart, pretty  girl in her own world, without anyone to challenge her. Kaname, at  least, has me, and I have her. All that means is that we have rivals  and enemies, of course… but it’s fun. To have that kind of rival. We  understand each other to a degree, we can talk to a degree, and we’ll  protect each other to a degree. It’s quite a specialised degree, but  that Shion understood one thing we’d barely noticed in ourselves.  Instinctively, now, there is the outside world, and there is Kaname and  I. Somehow, she’s part of my world, and when the outside attacks her, I  defend her as if she was I. No, perhaps more zealously than that. I  don’t really care what normal people say about me, but somehow,  together, we have enough pride to care, and fight back. But even so,  all that stuff’s no reason to take on Amane. She doesn’t bother us. No,  that’s not true. She doesn’t bother us directly, but that existence  still bothers Kaname and now that’s worrying me. I’m worried, I think,  that I said that, and it sounded so right. I’m not that competitive.  Why do I suddenly care? But it’s because… Kaname speaks about her that  way. My Kaname? I respect her, a little, even though she’s so arrogant  and brutish and common and stupid, more than I respect Amane. So I want  to beat all those things she said. I want to shoot Amane down, if that  will make Kaname stand tall. And I want to do it with her. These  reflections- it’s scary.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a nice dream,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Humph,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But if anyone could make it happen, it’s us,” Kaname said. “I’ll think on it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t take me too seriously,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Too  late. In any case, shouldn’t we be going? I thought we were supposed to  be getting some fresh air, but we haven’t even left the dorms.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, as you recall, you interrupted me when I conceded I didn’t know exactly where to go,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, nowhere where there are any damn clubs. Or people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about the forest?” Momomi suggested. “It’s so big you’re unlikely to meet anyone there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, fine,” Kaname said. “As long as we don’t go near the paddock. Amane’s always surrounded by fangirls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. It’s very irritating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  let’s go,” Kaname said, turning and walking down the stairs. They  passed a few students, ignoring them and being ignored, then crossed  the threshold and stepped out into the sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sheltered  her eyes. “The sun’s low in the sky. I guess we didn’t pick the best  day to try this.” When she looked up, Kaname had already walked off,  forcing her to jog to catch up. “You walk too fast!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do I?” Kaname said. She slowed slightly, allowing Momomi to keep up. “Well, I’m used to walking fast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright for you,” Momomi said. “Some of us aren’t as tall or fit as you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bear that in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  crossed the verge of the forest in silence, leaves crunching under  their feet. As they’d predicted, most of the students were indoors,  either on club activities or simply to avoid the cold. The peace was  comforting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This place is so filthy rich,” Kaname said  eventually. “I’m reminded of that again and again. You could probably  build an entire council estate on the land taken up by this forest, all  for the aesthetic whims of the school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s pretty,”  Momomi said defensively. “And it’s probably an important natural  habitat, too. Besides, a council estate wouldn’t be much use on a hill  in the middle of nowhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A prison, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shook her head. “You think in the wrong way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced back. “Practically, yes. That is fairly impractical for this place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t think practically all the time,” Momomi said. “There’s no fun in that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you definitely can’t dream all the time,” Kaname said. “That’ll get you killed. Maybe your kind can get away with it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can only say that because you’ve no idea what my life’s really life,”  Momomi said bitterly. “It’s not a fairy tale. My parents give me  orders. I grow up pretty and then get sold out to the first rich man  who’ll take me. If I were to dream, it would be because I have nothing  else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re here,” Kaname said. “I don’t see many dispatches from High Command, Italy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course,” Momomi said. “They wouldn’t bother to write.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  closed her eyes, shrugging. “Point taken. My mother doesn’t write  either, of course. I think she prefers to pretend I don’t exist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  people are people, wherever they’re from,” Momomi said. “So there are  always the unlucky ones. That doesn’t change, rich or poor. Besides,  I’m only here as a punishment. I can only hope they’re feeling really  angry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned, looking ahead. “There’s a break in the trees there. That’s the lake, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Yep. You couldn’t build council houses on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You could rent it out for water sports.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re hopeless,” Momomi sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  walked forwards into the clearing and sat on the gentle slope, looking  down into the shimmering surface of the lake. “Perhaps. You’d better  get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi collapsed, hugging her knees. “Oh, I am.” She sighed. “I didn’t pick the best time. It’s really cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  looked out of the surface of the lake. “I guess that’s us, isn’t it? We  go out and mope by a lake, instead of moping in our room… hopeless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here.” Kaname thrust her jacket at Momomi, not looking at her. “You’re cold, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yes, but…” Momomi blinked, then tried anger. “You can’t just-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A  weakling like you is only going to whine,” Kaname said, eyes on the  lake. “If a little more cold is the price of shutting you up, that’s  fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m not stupid enough to say no,” Momomi said,  taking it and throwing it on. “You make me feel so useless and weak,  though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname hugged herself. “I’m sure you can live with that. It got you my jacket.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just from you, I’ll live with it,” Momomi said. “You wouldn’t let me do anything else. But that’s okay.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  just nodded. They watched the light, slanting down from the sky, and  scattering across the aquamarine mirror of the lake below them.</span></p>
