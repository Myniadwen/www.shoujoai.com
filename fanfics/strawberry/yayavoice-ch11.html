<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Author’s Notes:</strong> </span><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I know it’s a labeled as a filler  but I guess it can count as Chapter 8.5. The only reason I say it’s a  filler because Tamao isn’t one of the main characters in my story. But  you can count this as a sort of prologue to the story for Tamao and  Nagisa I’m writing.</span></p>

<p>----------</p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Filler: Tamao: For the best…</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari-chan  came by earlier and invited me out for a walk. I was a bit happy that  she had honored my request to come to me when she had decided. There  were a few things that I wanted to talk to her about as well.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was around four in the afternoon, Nagisa-chan and I were just on our  way back to our room after a short walk. It was a rare thing lately, as  I’m sure Nagisa-chan wanted to spend time with someone I’d rather not  name because… I’d probably kill her <em>‘again!’</em> in my head. It was  then that we saw Hikari, dressed in a yellow sundress and a blue vest.  She was walking away from the direction of our room. My only guess was  she came looking for me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My red haired roommate beat me to  greeting her. “Hikari-chan! Good Afternoon.” Nagisa-chan called out and  ran towards our St. Spica friend, brightly and happily smiling at her  and even almost pouncing on the girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari-chan returned  Nagisa-chan explosively happy greeting with a gentle smile. “Good  Afternoon. Nagisa-chan…” she paused and looked at me. “Tamao-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  knew immediately what she wanted. I smiled and nodded to her,  acknowledging her hidden message. I turned my full attention  temporarily to Nagisa-chan. “Nagisa-chan, Hikari-chan and I have to  talk for a bit. Please head back without me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ehhhhh…” She  pouted, she wasn’t appreciating being left out of the story again. But  it was for the best, there are things that Nagisa-chan shouldn’t know…  to keep her happy or at the very least… so that I would not be the one  to make her sad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry. Nagisa-chan…” Hikari-chan clasped  her hand together and bowed her head towards Nagisa-chan in an almost  begging manner. “…It’s a little private… I asked Tamao-chan because I  had a feeling she could help me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I watched as Nagisa-chan  blushed in embarrassment at having someone bow to her like that. “AH!  Don’t do that Hikari-chan. I don’t really mind.” Or so she said, but I  could tell that from her laugh at the end she was really bothered that  she couldn’t be part of it. The girl is surprisingly curious, even if  she doesn’t look it. Hikari-chan thanked her and began walking towards.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  told Nagisa-chan that I will be back as soon as I could and began  walking away with Hikari-chan. I noted that Nagisa-chan had that cute  look of frustration, she does it whenever feels annoyed or slightly  upset. I giggled and purposely showed her making her know that I know  she pouting. This would cause her to pout just a little more, before  she realizes I’m just messing with her head… that makes her pout even  more, which unfortunately for her but fortunate for me because I get to  laugh and see her make a cute pouting face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We walked in silence;  we didn’t want our conversation to be overheard by anyone. It was  almost an unspoken agreement between us to look for somewhere private  before we have our talk. We found it at probably the best possible  place for her to talk about this, the church’s secret backyard garden…  Hikari-chan and Yaya-san’s fateful meeting place. She stood there just  beside the door staring at the places where she probably pictured  Yaya-san lounge around. She took a few moments before turning her  attention to me and said; “Tamao-san, I want to know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” I  said and smiled. I felt a little envious of Yaya-san. I’m not blind, I  know from the way that she looks at Hikari-chan… that she harbors deep  feelings for this blonde girl. I know… because that exactly how I look  at Nagisa-chan. But it’s also quite sad, that this girl is face will be  faced with difficult choices sooner or later. And though my  interference might have a negative impact to Yaya-san or Amane-sama on  the long run, depending on Hikari-chan’s feelings, I still fee that as  a friend I should at least help in what ways I can.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In that  case, Hikari-chan, I have some good news and some bad news for you…  both are important and this might change your decision.” I looked at  her seriously. This is very important and should probably have been  said before Hikari made her choice. She looked at me and kept all  attention on what I was about to say, I could see a lot of anxiety in  her eyes. I’m sure the words ‘bad news’ didn’t sound the least bit  pleasing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” I hesitated telling her, and figured she might not  want to know too badly. Not to mention that these are purely my  observations of her best friend and not actual facts. “These are just  my observations so they could be wrong… Do you still want to know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She swallowed nervously before nodding. “Yes. Please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  must say that I am surprised by her decisions. I had actually expected  the opposites to be honest. I had always pictured Nagisa-chan and  Hikari-chan to be more or less the same… I had thought that by now  Hikari-chan would be too fond of Amane-sama to even notice Yaya-san.  But I guess I was wrong… <em>‘and oddly it didn’t feel so bad being wrong.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  then… I guess I should start with the good news.” I noted that Hikari  tensed up when I said that. “I’m not sure if you had noticed Hikari but  I think, Yaya-san really liked you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari blushes and looks  down. She smiles and oddly but happily says; “Yeah… she tells me that a  lot. She used to be very clingy and teased me a lot about anything…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seeing  that she was a little dense was painful… I feel sorry for Yaya-san  already. But at the very least the way she looked just now might  actually give Yaya-san some hope. I decided to interrupt and correct  the girl’s idea of Yaya-san liking her. I placed both my hands on her  shoulders shook her once and held her firmly. “No… Hikari. Yaya-san  REALLY… Liked you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes open wide just as quickly as her jaw drops. She looked stunned at the revelation. “Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She liked you Hikari.” I repeated to her seeing that she was in a shocked state of disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she recovered from the shock she immediately asked; “Since… when?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know. But I do know, that the clinginess, the teasing, the over  protectiveness and the possessiveness were her tiny ways of showing you  that she liked you… most likely in that way, Hikari.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But why  didn’t she just tell me?” Hikari-chan asked, beginning to look a little  frustrated. Tears dared to fall from her eyes as I can only imagine how  hurt she is learning that she had been so insensitive to her own best  friend’s feelings.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I smiled and gave her a slightly disappointed  curious look. I doubted Yaya-san didn’t try to tell the girl her  feelings… at most I can imagine that Yaya-san had done so indirectly  and seemingly jokingly that Hikari-chan here didn’t catch on. I guess  that says that Yaya-san failed being direct with her feelings, but  she’s not completely at fault. And in the end… there really isn’t  anyone you can blame for these things.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari-chan… I recall that you have or had quite a big crush on Ootori-sama, am I right?” I asked to prove something.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked a bit dumbfounded but answered “Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My best guess is that Yaya-san… she knew you didn’t feel that way about her and that you loved someone else.” <em>‘How could she not? She listens to the girl everyday, I almost share your pain Yaya-san.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But why did she kiss me?!” she asked almost shouting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That  surprised me a bit because I found myself looking around wondering if  anyone was eavesdropping on us. I then frowned thinking <em>‘does she really need to ask?’</em> But I suppose I can help her understand. “My guess… It was a moment of  weakness, and a last desperate attempt to make you understand her  feelings. It didn’t work out at all though… and almost ruined your  friendship.” I told her trying to keep my tone of voice as soft as  comforting, as oppose to how I really feel at that moment</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looks down sadly, a few drops of tears fell from her eyes. “I see…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  gave her sometime to think and absorb the information. And as easy and  painless I wanted to tell her these things, I suppose it almost  impossible for her not to feel guilty, saddened or pained, especially  not after she hears my bad news. She was crying already and though I  didn’t really want her to hurt even more. I decided that once is better  than twice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the bad news Hikari…” I paused at myself,  dropping the honorifics for now. This was just too serious to care  about such things at the moment. “Is that… she might be already making  measures to get over you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?” I watched her teary eyes open wide again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  decided to spare her too much thinking. “She’s spending as little time  as possible with you lately has she not?” I watch her nod eyes open and  full of tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s probably trying to touch you less and less as possible lately too right?” Again she nodded in response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Has  she teased you lately?” I asked. Yaya-san’s teasing after all seemed  like mine, a way of showing her affections. I hoped that Hikari-chan  was taking this all to heart, she’ll need it if she truly intends to  find out if she has feelings for her best friend or not.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It might have been the other way around lately…” she quickly and almost inaudibly muttered in response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Which had caught my attention that I had to ask; “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  blushed and looked away. Seeing that reaction, made me decided that  I’ll either try to ask her later or just let my own imagination fill  the gaps. “So now that you know this… Hikari…” I paused and waited for  her to look at me…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you going to do?” I held her hands  tightly. I meant a lot of things when I did so. Like don’t run away, or  do what you think is best. Because… in a way she’ll be carrying my  unfulfilled wish too… I didn’t mind the tears that started following  from my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you going to risk hurting her before she gets  over you? Or risk hurting yourself if she isn’t actually in love or had  already gotten over you?” By the time I had said that my tears were  flowing quite strongly… I felt that when the time came and she makes  her decision and that is also the time when I have to make mine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  couldn’t control my tears, and if she’s as dense as I think she is, she  wouldn’t realize why. I then continued to tell her, her last choice,  but all the emotions I felt were taking a toll on me. Envy, Sadness,  Guilt, and a bit of Anger… made my voice shake; “…or just let… things  be… and forget… about… all this?” With that said I just looked at her,  with eyes so blurry and full of tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was still crying and at this point was as badly as I was. Her voice shook too as she spoke; “Tamao-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” I almost sounded bitter. But I swear it was the crying fit…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You like Nagisa-chan don’t you?” she asked sounding a bit worried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I guess she wasn’t as dense as I thought she was.’</em> was my first and only thought… as mean as it sounded. Eyes still full  of tears and throat oddly parched… I could only close my eyes and  wholeheartedly nod.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then why don’t you…” I felt that knew what  she wanted to say. That I should tell Nagisa-chan how I feel, that  somehow it could work out and we could be closer… and that I didn’t  have to suffer like this. But of course I thought that I knew her  better and would already know what would happen… just like Yaya-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari…” I called her attention cutting of what she was about to say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Y-Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  situation may be the same… but people are different. I can’t and don’t  want to commit the same mistake Yaya-san did.” I said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mistake?” Hikari-chan had almost yelled. If I didn’t know any better, I’d probably think she was in love with Yaya-san.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pardon  my words Hikari, to me Yaya-san kissing you was a mistake or accident  on her behalf. I believe that she didn’t mean to do it.” I apologize  and explained to her my view on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And though she didn’t seem to like it, she looked like she understood what I had meant. “I guess that seems right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“and to continue… I can’t tell her directly how I feel when I know that she loves someone else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just like Yaya-chan…” she mumbled out and looked at the ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose.” I muttered almost absently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But!” Sensing her wish to argue for my sake, I had decided to firmly cut her off and tell her why. “Hikari!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?” she seemed surprised by my sudden sternness… but that was ok.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yaya-san…  as your best friend did what she thought was best. I believe that all  she truly wanted was you to be happy, even if she had to suffer for it.  Sure… she screwed up a little, and allowed you to see a part of her  that she didn’t want you to see, because it would confuse you and/or  ruin your friendship.” I said to her, but to be honest… parts of those  were really my feelings, rather than what I think Yaya-san’s were.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” We were silent for a moment, especially Hikari-chan who was now trying desperately to stop her tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  please understand; that as her best friend… No matter how painful it  is… I can’t and don’t want to interfere, as long as she’s happy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tamao-san…” she looked at me with a soft and sad smile, the blueness of her eyes hidden away by a wall of tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  better to have a part of something, rather than risk losing it all. So  please promise… to keep that between us.” I asked her to never tell  anyone. I had never told anyone, though it may have been obvious from  time to time… But as long as Nagisa-chan doesn’t know, then there is no  need for me worry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With tears forming from both our eyes she promised and linked our pinkies together in a ‘pinky swear’. “Tamao-san… I promise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thank you. That’s all I ask.” I told her, shook our pinkies and wiped the tears in my eyes with my free hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…And…”  she added and paused which made me wonder if she was hesitating. But  one look at her, drying of her tears and giving me a confident smile  told me otherwise. “I’ll do my best learn my true feelings. I have to  do so before Yaya-chan completely gives up on me.” She said almost  jokingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see…” I smiled as I heard her decision. “I wish you the best luck then, Hikari-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks a lot! And… Tamao-san… Maybe you should give Nagisa-chan the chance to understand your feelings too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  smile irked for a moment and my eyes felt heavy. Deep inside I knew  that I had no chance. But all this talk about risks, chances and  mistakes… makes one think more doesn’t it? “I guess I’ll try to keep  that in consideration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hikari-chan’s smiled brighter and returned to me what I said earlier. “Thank you. That’s all I ask.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  laughed at that comment for a while. And when we were done… I decided  to head back. Hikari decided to stay in the garden for a while and  think about how she’ll try and learn her true feelings for Yaya-san. I  suggested to her before I left that she should just try and spend time  with the girl, doing things that they used to do a lot together… except  singing of course, after all we’re not sure if Yaya-san’s voice has  returned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I arrived back into the dorms, I had probably gone out  for just over an hour. I had decided to stop by a the restroom the  ground floor and check whether the crying we did earlier left any too  noticeable details of it on my face, before I headed back to our room.  And had I known what was awaiting me in my room, I would have probably  not come back so early.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When I opened the door, I screamed in  surprise when something or someone surprised and pounced at me, yelling  “TAMAO-CHAN!!! I...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My attacker and I almost fell onto the  floor, had I not quickly stepped back a step or two. I closed my eyes  felt a surge of pain mostly from behind me, as I ended up being  sandwiched between the outer wall of one of our front door neighbors  room, and a soft flesh of someone who distinctly smells like  Nagisa-chan and her shampoo. My face felt warm, incredibly warm… in  fact, it was too warm to be just mine. I slowly opened my eyes and was  met with a pair dark yet soft red eyes, opened as wide as my own… and  for good reason.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The warm feeling on my face that made me think  it was too warm to be just mine was right… there was another one  directly on mine. And most of it was on my lips. It didn’t take me long  to see, but it took a while for me to register that… Our lips were  together…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We were both stunned for a while, but it was I who  first recovered. I decided that pushing her away and citing that this  was an accident would be the best solution.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah! I’m sorry Nagisa-chan?!” I quickly apologized.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?! Ah! … n-n-No… it’s my fault. I should be sorry.” she looked down, blushing in apology.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thinking very quickly to avert the matter I told her; “Oh no! it’s okay Nagisa-chan! It was an accident!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right! An… Accident.” She absently mumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…”  There was an eerie silence between us. It felt odd and suffocating. I  decided to give her sometime to recover, so I said; “I think go down to  the dinning hall and grab a juice or something…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But as I turned  to leave she almost yells out; “Ah! Tamao-chan! Wait!” as she grabs my  hand and pulls me back. “It’s alright. We didn’t mean anything by it…”  she said as her voice began to crack and her eyes began forming tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>oh no! I didn’t mean to make her cry.’</em> I quickly placed a hand on her head and asked; “Nagisa-chan! What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  looked at me, teary eyed and in between sobs and hiccups she told me;  “Don’t go! I don’t want what happened to Hikari-chan and Yaya-chan to  happen to us. I don’t want us to have a fight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nagisa…” I  patted her head and wrapped my arms around her neck and pulled her head  close to my chest. “shh… I would never fight with you Nagisa-chan. Your  smile is so important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tamao-chan!” She called my name loudly and hugged my waist as tight as she possibly could. And it was painful… literally. <em>‘Oh no… I can’t breathe… too tight… she never hugged me this tight before.’</em> And for a moment I thought I was going to black out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She loosens her hold of me and without knowing it, allowed me to breathe once again. <em>‘Thank You… Maria-sama…’</em> I silently prayed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tamao-chan…” she softly called out my name.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it, Nagisa?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  always be best friends forever right?” Those words sounded so familiar…  I then remembered they were the same words that Hikari-chan told  Yaya-san when they made up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“…” ‘<em>I guess in the end it wasn’t  actually Yaya-san decision to get over Hikari-chan. Instead it was  Hikari-chan’s. As it’s Nagisa-chan’s to make mine.’</em> With my hand I brushed the hair on the back of her head gently. I nodded and continued hugging her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I guess… I know what I have to do.’</em></span></p>
