<h1>Strawberry Panic Anime Continuity FanFic (part 2 of 23)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ninemil.html">ninemil</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/animecon-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Only because Tsubomi-chan snores like a pig!&quot;

Yaya flashed a mischievous smile and hurled the battered pillow back 
across the dormitory at the strawberry haired first year, deftly dodging 
as it returned only seconds later. The two girls giggled as the exchange 
continued, Yaya standing astride her bed, Tsubomi racing around her as 
she collected fresh ammunition.

&quot;Perhaps Tsubomi needs to lose some weight; after all, only fat girls 
snore!&quot; Yaya called.

Tsubomi stopped and stood upright, looking down as she stroked her hands 
protectively over her tummy. She looked hurt.

&quot;Uh what do you mean by that?&quot;

Ploy successful, Yaya launched the other pillow straight into Tsubomi&#39;s 
face. The first year toppled with the blow, collapsing in an exaggerated 
heap on the floor, legs akimbo.

&quot;So vain for one so young!&quot; Yaya teased, eyes flashing as she bounced 
back behind the bed for cover as Tsubomi picked herself up and raced 
after her, looking for revenge.

Despite being early, Chiyo had already gone, and Tamao was readying 
herself to leave, eager to get back to her dormitory to clean up before 
breakfast. Classes restarted today, and the return to routine offered a 
chance of normality after the week of upheaval ahead of the election. 
She managed a weak smile and offered,

&quot;I think the pair of you both snore actually; you were certainly doing 
something that kept Chiyo-chan and I awake all night.&quot;

The Spican girls both stopped mid-fight, trading nervous glances and 
grinning sheepishly, before Yaya excused herself to the shower and 
Tsubomi quickly made her farewells and disappeared back to her own room, 
blushing awkwardly as she left.

Tamao smiled to herself with the achievement; the constant flirting a 
little much for her mood this morning, glad she&#39;d managed to shut them 
up finally.

With a word of thanks for letting her stay, Tamao bid Yaya goodbye 
through the closed bathroom door and disappeared out into the dormitory 
corridor on her way back to the room she shared with Nagisa.

It was light already, and girls of various years and schools wandered 
from room to room in their bed clothes, nattering as they prepared for 
the day ahead. Nodding greetings here and there, Tamao tried to stay 
chirpy and keep her mind off the possibility that Shizuma was still in 
her room. She hadn&#39;t slept long, and already suffering from fatigue, the 
last thing she needed now was an uncomfortable encounter with the 
former-Etoile.

Rounding the final corner to their dormitory, she crossed her fingers 
and took a deep breath before cracking the door ajar.

It was dark inside; the white linen curtains were still drawn and what 
light there was filtered through a haze of burnt incense. Tamao peered 
round the door, taking in the train of clothing scattered across the 
floor and the huddled form of the two girls curled up in Nagisa&#39;s bed.

Tamao looked down in dismay. She didn&#39;t need this. She considered 
popping back to Yaya&#39;s room to ask if she could use the shower there 
instead.

Just as she decided that might be more sensible, she heard the door 
handle of the opposite room click and the familiar voice of Chihaya 
Takemura drift into the corridor. Panicked, and knowing she couldn&#39;t let 
her neighbours discover Shizuma&#39;s presence or she wouldn&#39;t hear the end 
of it, she slipped through the open door, quietly pulling it to behind 
her.

Leaning with her back against the door, she held her breath nervously; 
heart racing as she waited for Chihaya and Mizushima&#39;s chatter to fade 
as they wandered off to the breakfast hall. Sure they had gone, she 
breathed a sigh of relief, relaxing her shoulders and considering what 
to do next.

She looked again at the scene before her, the details more apparent as 
she became accustomed to the dim light. A pair of elegant long-stemmed 
glasses sat next to each other on Nagisa&#39;s desk along with several 
deformed candles and a burnt out incense stick. Nagisa&#39;s clothes lay in 
a pile in the centre of the room, and Shizuma&#39;s uniform and expensive 
looking underwear were folded tidily at the foot of the bed. Tamao&#39;s 
proximity to the sleeping couple sparked an awkward curiosity, and she 
gingerly leaned forward to peer at them.

In the dark haze she couldn&#39;t make much out, and carefully, she crept a 
pace or two forward, cringing as the floor creaked under foot.

Shizuma lay curled up around the auburn haired fourth year, cradling her 
gently from behind, their naked bodies intertwined and their chests 
rising and falling in unison as they slept. The bed covers barely 
covered the pair, and Tamao could see more than she&#39;d usually have 
wanted amongst the strands of the former-Etoile&#39;s long silver hair. 
Tamao sighed in awe at the sixth grader&#39;s beauty and the serenity of the 
sleeping couple.

Her mind blinked back to the night she&#39;d knelt before the sleeping 
Nagisa, ruffling her soft red hair fondly before pledging her love for 
her. Was this what she had meant when she said those words? Really? She 
tried to imagine herself in Shizuma&#39;s place, wrapped around Nagisa in 
the same warm embrace. She looked at herself in third person, scouring 
the mental image in an attempt to make it tangible, plausible. What if 
the imaginary Nagisa woke up? Would she kiss her? Would they shower 
together? An awkward feeling rose in the pit of Tamao&#39;s stomach as she 
considered what it would feel like, pressed against Nagisa&#39;s naked body, 
the water washing over them. There was something very uncomfortable 
about it all.

She jumped as Chihaya&#39;s voice suddenly bawled from the corridor behind 
her,

&quot;No you idiot, you left it in our room like usual!&quot;

Tamao panicked as Shizuma stirred, rolling backwards as her head tilted 
to one side, almost directly facing Tamao as she stood as silent as 
possible, muscles tense and blue eyes wide in fear. She wanted to hide 
somewhere but couldn&#39;t move her frozen body.


Counting the seconds by the pounding of her heart in her chest, she 
prayed for Shizuma&#39;s eyes to stay closed, prayed for Chihaya to keep her 
mouth shut. Moments passed before she allowed herself to relax again.

&#39;This is ridiculous!&#39; she thought to herself, scowling at her situation 
and the nagging curiosity that had gotten her in to it. This close to 
the bed and so far from the door and escape, there was only one thing 
for it.

&quot;I&#39;ve found it!&quot; Chihaya called again, and this time Tamao bolted the 
few steps into the bathroom as Shizuma&#39;s long eyelashes cracked apart. 
Pulling the door to quickly she kicked the shower on before the 
former-Etoile had the chance to come to her senses.

Shizuma looked around blearily before turning her gaze to the snoozing 
form beside her. Smiling, she brushed the hair away from Nagisa&#39;s ear 
and whispered,

&quot;Nagisa, wake up honey. It&#39;s time I left.&quot;

The younger Miatorian stirred, turning to face her companion.

&quot;Hmm? Is it morning already?&quot;

&quot;Yes my love; and I think Tamao is here.&quot;

Stood against the shower wall, Tamao waited quietly for her heart to 
slow, waving a bare foot in the shower to make it sound as though she 
were washing herself down, light-headed and exasperated by the whole 
ordeal.

- - - -

The water was soothing on her face, and Amane stood directly under the 
shower head for a moment, letting the cool water wash over her. Running 
her fingers through her short black hair, she twisted her neck, letting 
the cascading liquid run across her shoulders and back.

She was tired this morning. Hikari hadn&#39;t slept well, troubled by 
something as she dreamt, which when added to the exertion of regular 
morning practice with Star Bride had left the older Etoile worn. The 
shower was blissfully relaxing, but knowing she had little time before 
having to do her duties at breakfast, Amane hurriedly soaped herself 
down.

Duties... How Shizuma had coped on her own, let alone carrying the death 
of Kaori at the same time confounded her. With the previous day&#39;s 
pleasant conversation, she found herself admiring the former-Etoile, 
understanding more clearly the burden the Miatorian had carried.

All the more satisfying to see her so happy now with Nagisa.

Turning the shower off, Amane stepped onto the cold floor tiles and 
dried herself down before wrapping the long towel around her. Leaving 
the cubicle she headed for the locker rooms to retrieve her uniform. As 
she reached her locker, she heard familiar husky tones behind her.

&quot;Morning Amane.&quot;

She smiled, knowing only one person that would so happily disregard her 
new title. Without turning from her open locker, she called back,

&quot;Good morning Kaname.&quot;

The tall fifth year padded softly from behind the row of lockers, 
leaning casually against the wall. Arms crossed, she was dressed for the 
courts, sporting a tennis racket and a leather bag.

&quot;And how is the new Etoile today? I see you were late out to practice.&quot;

Amane gathered her clothes from the locker, smiling at the bait as she 
wondered whether or not to bite to it. Too tired to spar, she opted to 
change the subject.

&quot;Practicing for the tennis tournament?&quot;

Kaname nodded, adding,

&quot;We&#39;re looking strong for the doubles this fall. All the same, it&#39;s a 
shame you&#39;re so busy now. The team will miss your strong volley.&quot;

Amane stepped back, checking she had everything before closing her 
locker. She regarded the school council member with a reserved fondness.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine Kaname.&quot;

With a gesture she made to leave and headed towards the changing rooms. 
Just before she was out of ear shot, Kaname called,

&quot;You don&#39;t happen to know what&#39;s going on with Miyuki do you?&quot;

Amane turned and shook her head, asking,

&quot;Why, is something wrong?&quot;

Kaname shrugged in a disinterested fashion, but continued anyway,

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t know, but Shion spent the whole of yesterday evening 
prattling about her.&quot;

Pondering the comment, Amane left to change.

- - - -

&quot;Oh I give up!&quot;

Tamao launched her brush across the desk as she failed for a fifth time 
to tie her hair back properly. It bounced around briefly, making a fresh 
mess of the books and candles she&#39;d only recently tidied up. An annoying 
cocktail of tiredness, Nagisa&#39;s inane waffle and the weight of the 
week&#39;s stress overcame her, and she cupped her forehead, resting both 
elbows on the table, her hair falling forward across her face. Nagisa, 
who had been mid-flow, recounting the previous afternoon with Hikari and 
Amane as she finished up doing her own hair, turned and looked at Tamao 
in concern.

&quot;Tamao-chan?&quot;

Tamao remained silent, eyes closed. Making sure her own hair band was 
secure, Nagisa crossed the room and retrieved the hair brush from the 
back of the desk. Placing both hands gently on Tamao&#39;s shoulders, she 
offered,

&quot;Here, let me.&quot;

Sullen, Tamao sat back in the chair as Nagisa bunched her roommate&#39;s 
long dark hair up in one hand, brushing it through carefully with the 
other. Through lowered eye lashes, she watched the fourth year in the 
mirror as she worked.

&quot;Tamao-chan is lucky to have such beautiful hair; if she looked after it 
properly it wouldn&#39;t cause her so much grief.&quot;

She was waffling again, as though the past week hadn&#39;t even happened. 
Tamao sighed inwardly, wondering if Nagisa had even noticed her feelings 
since returning to their dorm. She seemed to be perched many miles from 
reality on her self-absorbed cloud nine; a mix of Shizuma and her new 
life hob-knobbing with the Etoile. Catching the bitter tone in her own 
train of thought, Tamao kicked herself for dragging it out.

After all, it was all done with now anyway, and after this morning, she 
was wondering what exactly she&#39;d wanted from it in the first place.

Suddenly, she realised Nagisa had stopped combing and was looking 
straight at her in the mirror.

&quot;I know this isn&#39;t easy Tamao.&quot;

The change of tone caught her off guard. Was Nagisa reading her mind or 
was her face really that transparent? She shrugged weakly, replying,

&quot;It doesn&#39;t need to be difficult either Nagisa. Nothing&#39;s actually 
changed has it.&quot;

Nagisa dipped her head solemnly and continued combing Tamao&#39;s hair,

&quot;I wish things with Shizuma-sama had been settled sooner. We could have 
run for Etoile without any of this ruining it.&quot;

Tamao smiled wryly. The thought of day to day life as the Etoile with 
Nagisa&#39;s new baggage in tow conjured amusing mental images, especially 
with that morning fresh in mind.

&quot;I can&#39;t imagine you having the time for it now Nagisa. I&#39;ll be 
surprised if you actually go to class as it is.&quot;

Nagisa looked up from behind Tamao&#39;s head, grinning back in the mirror. 
She was so obviously ecstatic with the outcome with Shizuma.

&quot;It&#39;s so...&quot; she fished for the right words. &quot;...um - &quot;

&quot;Domestic?&quot; Tamao cut in.

Nagisa laughed and tugged hard on Tamao&#39;s hair as she tightened the bow. 
Tamao winced.

&quot;Ow!&quot;

An evil glimmer flickered in Nagisa&#39;s eyes. Content to leave her sulk 
behind, Tamao attempted to summarize,

&quot;I&#39;m happy for Nagisa-chan, I really am. I just need to adjust.&quot;

Nagisa finished up and held a hand mirror so Tamao could see round the 
back. Satisfied, Tamao stood and straightened her uniform, picking off 
some loose hairs and looking herself up and down in the mirror. The 
familiar black uniform, her brown satchel waiting by the foot of her 
bed, the thought of lessons, structure; it was all very appealing.

&quot;Back to normal?&quot; Nagisa asked, uncannily following the same sentiment.

&quot;Let&#39;s hope so eh,&quot; Tamao said, taking one last look before turning for 
the Dormitory door.

- - - -

&quot;Miyuki?&quot;

Shizuma had spent the better part of an hour preparing for this, yet 
even then, the idea of turning the brass door handle she grasped 
remained extremely unappealing.

With the overwhelming need for closure with Nagisa sated and her 
emotional security once again intact, the former-Etoile&#39;s initial fury 
at Miyuki&#39;s meddling had calmed somewhat, and it was only now, knowing 
she had to face her friend that she started worrying about the 
consequences of the past few days. Her possessive streak had always been 
one of her failings, and she knew she&#39;d gone overboard in the election 
fall out. If she was completely honest with herself, she&#39;d have to admit 
the thought of letting Nagisa go having hurt her so many times, to take 
the easy option and progress things properly with Miyuki had even 
crossed her mind. The morning of the election; having Miyuki brush her 
hair in the hope the proximity would spark something inside her for her 
former room mate standing testament. One last ditch attempt to convince 
herself everything would be fine in Nagisa&#39;s absence. After all, Miyuki 
had made it obvious she was open to the idea.

But it hadn&#39;t worked, the sensation hollow despite the sultry sixth year 
running her hands through Shizuma&#39;s hair. It had barely conjured the 
fond memories of their younger years when Miyuki used to do it for her 
all the time, let alone anything desirable in the present; such had been 
the degree of Shizuma&#39;s yearning for the girl Miyuki was trying to take 
from her.

Shizuma sighed. Regardless of the whys, she knew she had to do this. 
Miyuki hadn&#39;t been seen in over a day, and classes were less than an 
hour away. Even if they didn&#39;t patch things up, which given the gravity 
of the situation seemed unlikely, she&#39;d be dumping a life time&#39;s 
friendship if she didn&#39;t at least make sure Miyuki was okay.

Resolute, she turned the handle.

&#39;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t love you Miyuki&#39; she thought to herself, trying 
to justify events, &#39;it&#39;s just a different love to the others, that&#39;s 
all. I thought you understood that.&#39;

Opening the door, she called again,

&quot;Miyuki?&quot;

The school council President was curled up on her bed, back to the wall, 
eyes closed and her head resting against the side of her book case. The 
morning sun flooded into the room, the curtains still wide open from the 
previous day. Shizuma closed the door softly behind her, stepping into 
the centre of the room. Miyuki&#39;s legs were curled beneath her, her black 
Miator uniform crumpled and creased. A half drunk glass of water sat on 
the floor next to the bed, and Shizuma found herself wondering how long 
Miyuki had been there.

&quot;Miyuki, it&#39;s almost time for class,&quot; Shizuma said loudly.

The sleeping form stirred, Miyuki&#39;s head tipping as she tried to focus 
on the speaker.

&quot;Shizuma?&quot;

Miyuki came to, groggy and dehydrated. She held the side of her head, 
grimacing as she discovered she still had a headache. Reaching down, she 
groped for the glass by the bed.

&quot;You still remember where you live then?&quot; Miyuki muttered, finishing the 
glass in one gulp.

Shizuma took the empty glass from Miyuki&#39;s hand and went to fill it 
again from the bathroom tap. Returning, she offered the fresh water.

&quot;What makes you think I forgot?&quot; Shizuma replied flatly.

&quot;You&#39;ve not come home in two days?&quot; Miyuki scowled, taking the glass and 
looking up at Shizuma with a moody expression. &quot;You could have at least 
offered the courtesy of a hello.&quot;

Shizuma sighed, perching on the edge of the bed as her dark haired 
companion sipped slowly.

&quot;I needed some space, that&#39;s all.&quot;

She looked into the tired face staring back, tear-stains obvious around 
the sullen brown eyes. Miyuki sneered,

&quot;You needed a fuck you mean,&quot; Her tone flippant, &quot;Feeling better now I 
take it?&quot;

Shizuma blanched and shook her head, trying not to bite despite the 
other girl&#39;s uncharacteristic tone,

&quot;You knew it was more than that with Nagisa,&quot; she stood again, seeking 
personal space as she struggled with her own temper, &quot;I&#39;d have let her 
go otherwise and you know it.&quot;

Miyuki glared as the former-Etoile turned away.

&quot;Didn&#39;t stop you using me as an emotional prop in the mean time though 
did it...&quot; Miyuki sighed, gazing blankly at the opposite wall, rolling 
the glass between her fingers. &quot;Handy Miyuki, always there between the 
flavour of the month.&quot;

Her self pity stung, and she sneered at how pathetic she sounded.

Shizuma looked back at her kinder garden room mate, frustrated.

&quot;You&#39;ve always been more than that Miyuki,&quot; she looked for words, 
something meaningful to reinforce the sentiment, but failed in the 
unpleasant atmosphere,

&quot;Have I really,&quot; Miyuki&#39;s tone was hollow, disinterested.

There was a moment&#39;s silence, and Shizuma leaned back against the closed 
door, searching her mind for a way forward. Miyuki continued staring at 
the wall, glazed eyes betraying the train of thought steam-rolling 
behind them. Something snapped inside and Miyuki lost it,

&quot;If I mean so much Shizuma, it&#39;d have been me at the summer house that 
first night you went back, and you wouldn&#39;t be pissing on Kaori&#39;s memory 
with that shallow wannabie! What do I have to do before you notice what 
I feel for a change?&quot;

Shizuma&#39;s face dropped in surprise and she pleaded for reason,

&quot;I know you loved Kaori too. We all did. I never pretended I was the 
only one with feelings.&quot;

Miyuki glared up at Shizuma,

&quot;For you Shizuma. Jesus how blind are you?&quot;

Shizuma baulked, and Miyuki sat forward on the bed, rage boiling over as 
she continued,

&quot;And for god sake, don&#39;t dare tell me I wasn&#39;t trying hard enough!&quot;

Miyuki launched the glass at Shizuma, water spraying the former-Etoile 
as the glass sailed past her ear, impacting on the wall behind and 
shattering into razor sharp pieces. Broken glass showered Shizuma and 
she flinched as it caught the side of her neck.


Shizuma clutched the wound and stared at Miyuki in disbelief. Bringing 
her hand back into view she looked in horror as it came away glistening 
with bright red blood.

Miyuki&#39;s hostile gaze remained locked on the former-Etoile&#39;s eyes, and 
Shizuma reeled, stepping backwards as she reached for the door handle, 
her heel grinding the glittering shards against the wooden floor.

&quot;What was I? Your spring board?&quot; Miyuki spat venom, but swayed giddily 
as she tried to stand, exhaustion getting the better of her. She put a 
hand out for the desk to steady herself and missed, tumbling forward 
onto the ground.

Shizuma looked at her in a heap on the floor, caught between feelings of 
worry and seething anger. Shaking her head she turned and to leave,

&quot;I&#39;ll inform the Sister you&#39;re sick and need the day off class. Get your 
head together.&quot;

Miyuki leered as the door slammed shut.

- - - -

&quot;Nagisa-onee-sama!&quot; Chiyo exclaimed in joy as the auburn haired fourth 
year pulled back the seat next to her. On the opposite side of the empty 
chair, Tamao looked up from her thoughts in surprise.

&quot;Where&#39;s Shizuma?&quot; she asked, looking around the bustling breakfast 
hall.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, she&#39;s not returned from her room yet,&quot; Nagisa said as she 
took her seat, adding &quot;She was going to look in on Miyuki next door 
before coming down, but she&#39;s been gone a long time. I&#39;m worried.&quot;

Nagisa spread the soft cotton napkin across her lap and looked back at 
Tamao, who tried to offer some reassurance.

&quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s fine, they&#39;re probably still talking.&quot;

Nagisa nodded, face still betraying her concern regardless. Trying to 
distract herself, she touched Chiyo&#39;s arm as she greeted the room temp 
fondly.

&quot;Good morning Chiyo-chan. Thank you for working so hard on our room 
after the election. I wish I could&#39;ve thanked you sooner but I couldn&#39;t 
come to the tea party.&quot;

Chiyo beamed, blushing as she congratulated herself inwardly; here was 
Tamao-chan and her onee-sama back together. Nagisa was smiling and 
everything was okay again! And all it took was a little housework!

Nagisa smiled at the first year&#39;s happy face, and waited for Amane to 
announce it was time for grace. The smell of bacon wafted from the open 
kitchen door and the trio stared in surprise as Nagisa&#39;s stomach growled 
angrily above the din of the chattering girls around them. Tamao 
giggled,

&quot;She&#39;s been keeping you busy then I guess,&quot; the comment soaring over 
Chiyo&#39;s head who looked at Tamao&#39;s mischievous grin in confusion. Nagisa 
blushed and quietly hoped Amane would hurry up before everyone else in 
the room formed the same opinion.

Thankfully, she didn&#39;t have to wait much longer, the elegant Spican 
silencing the room just by standing, before giving the floor to Hikari 
for the prayer.

As everyone dipped their heads and closed their eyes, the tiny blonde 
began, her delicate voice carrying the length of the hall with 
surprising ease,

&quot;Lord, thank you for granting us this food...&quot;

The words faded from Nagisa&#39;s mind as her thoughts turned back to 
Shizuma. Was she really okay or had something gone wrong? A pause in 
Hikari&#39;s words brought her back to focus, and she heard the breakfast 
hall door click as someone quietly entered. As Hikari continued, she 
felt a soft hand on her shoulder.

Opening one eye she found Shizuma kneeling next to her, a troubled look 
on her face. With growing concern, Nagisa noted a dressing on the 
former-Etoile&#39;s neck, and flecks of blood on the white lace of her 
uniform collar.

&quot;Shizuma-sama?&quot;

Shizuma shook her head, whispering back,

&quot;Not here,&quot; before taking the seat next to Chiyo and bowing her head in 
prayer as the others were.

- - - -

Nagisa sat huddled against Shizuma at the bottom of the stairwell across 
the corridor from the breakfast hall. Tamao stood next to them, wincing 
as Nagisa gingerly pulled back the corner of the dressing on Shizuma&#39;s 
neck, revealing a nasty gash just above her shoulder. Nagisa looked at 
Shizuma in concern, carefully pressing the dressing back into place 
before wrapping herself around Shizuma&#39;s arm and holding the sixth 
grader dearly.

Tamao sighed, the day not becoming any less stressful in a hurry.

&quot;It&#39;s not as bad as it looks. The nurse said the glass came out 
cleanly,&quot; Shizuma explained. &quot;It should heal quickly if I keep it 
covered.&quot;

&quot;You went to the nurse?&quot; Tamao asked in surprise. &quot;What did you tell 
her?&quot;

&quot;I said I&#39;d dropped a mirror. She seemed to take it okay.&quot;

Tamao looked concerned by the lie,

&quot;But surely if Miyuki is prepared to through glasses at you, shouldn&#39;t 
someone speak to the Sister?&quot;

Shizuma shook her head,

&quot;God no, the last thing I need right now is Sister Mizue getting 
involved; I&#39;m in enough trouble after the election ceremony.&quot; She gently 
stroked Nagisa&#39;s arm and added, &quot;I&#39;m sure Miyuki will be fine in a 
couple of days, I&#39;d rather stay out of her way for a bit until things 
blow over. If I need to change rooms to somewhere further away we can 
deal with that later when there won&#39;t be so many questions asked.&quot;

Tamao nodded, leaning against the bannister.

&quot;I guess.&quot;

&quot;Well we&#39;re away this weekend anyway,&quot; Nagisa pointed out. &quot;And I&#39;m sure 
Amane-senpai will let you stay with her till we leave. She seems very 
understanding.&quot;

Shizuma nodded, wondering when the first opportunity would be for her to 
see the Etoile. Tamao shuffled her foot for a moment, looking at the 
floor and considering something privately. Having come to a conclusion, 
she looked up at the two girls sat on the steps in front of her,

&quot;That&#39;s not necessary. I&#39;m sure the last thing Hikari-san and Amane-sama 
need right now is a gatecrasher. They&#39;re still adjusting to becoming 
Etoile.&quot; She paused, fiddling with her hair. &quot;Besides, there&#39;s no reason 
Shizuma-sama couldn&#39;t stay with us for a few days.&quot;

Shizuma looked up at Tamao in surprise, and Nagisa baulked,

&quot;Tamao-chan?&quot;

Tamao quickly added,

&quot;Providing you can both behave yourselves of course.&quot;

Nagisa blushed, but Shizuma looked at the younger girl in newly found 
respect, pondering the gesture,

&quot;You would do that for me Tamao?&quot; she asked.

Tamao looked directly into Shizuma&#39;s eyes and replied,

&quot;Of course. Shizuma-sama is a good friend of Nagisa-chan, which makes 
her a friend of mine. Besides, there&#39;s no reason why you shouldn&#39;t 
stay,&quot; and with a surprisingly sincere sense in her heart added, &quot;no 
reason at all.&quot;
