<h1>A Song and a Sketch (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bblade.html">bleeding.blade</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../strawberry/songsketch-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>At Tsubomi&#39;s insistence, Hikari had agreed to stay at a table located 
somewhere in the shadows, away from the exit. &quot;It&#39;s easier to surprise 
her this way,&quot; the pink-haired girl had argued. Hikari had finally 
relented.

When Yaya finally stepped onto the stage, the entire bar quieted. No one 
had ever seen her dress up for a performance before (not that she had 
needed to) and the sight of her in Tsubomi&#39;s ensemble was...breathtaking 
to say the least.

Tsubomi felt her jaw drop. Yaya&#39;s appearance in the shirt and dress had 
exceeded even her most private fantasies. The material clung to every 
swell and curve. Through the sheer fabric of the shirt, she could 
glimpse the shadows under Yaya&#39;s delicate collarbone. Tsubomi looked at 
Hikari, and was gratified (and agonized) to find a similarly entranced 
expression.

And then, as if all that hadn&#39;t been provocation enough, Yaya began to 
sing.

~~~~~

Hours (days, weeks?) later, a dazed Tsubomi noted that the night&#39;s 
performance had ended and that Yaya was signing the last few autographs 
of the evening. Earlier, she had told Hikari to wait until Yaya had 
finished this nightly ritual before approaching her. (&quot;Her fans can get 
pretty...hard-core. So you should just wait until they&#39;re all gone.&quot;) 
Unfortunately, the seat next to her was already vacant.

With a sense of impending doom, she watched the blonde woman make her 
way towards the unsuspecting brunette. When she saw Yaya turn around, 
eyes widening in stunned surprise at the sight of Hikari, Tsubomi stood 
up and fled. Even her capacity for emotional seppuku had its limits.

~~~~~

&quot;Yaya-chan?&quot;

That voice, played and re-played in countless dreams, entered Yaya&#39;s 
ears like a bullet and exploded somewhere in the back of her mind. 
Turning around, she caught sight of a long unseen but never forgotten 
angel.

&quot;Hikari...&quot;

~~~~~

They talked, they walked, they held hands as if in a dream. It was as if 
a lifetime had passed; it was as if nothing had ever changed. Hikari 
smiled, laughed, frowned and cried in turns, gliding through the waves 
of five years. Yaya responded in a daze; it was all too...surreal. All 
too soon, they were at Yaya&#39;s apartment, and Yaya had locked the door, 
and turned around to find Hikari drawing close, putting her angelic 
little hands on Yaya&#39;s collar, and it was as if nothing had ever 
changed, although a lifetime had passed. And Hikari was looking at her 
with a faintly pleading, begging expression, wanting her love, wanting 
her affirmation. And Yaya had realized then that everything had changed, 
that a lifetime had passed, that although this (their standing close 
together, one begging, one retreating) had happened before, the roles 
had been reversed. And Yaya had realized then that it was Tsubomi she 
wanted - slender, pink-haired Tsubomi with the smart, sensuous mouth, 
who had given Yaya her Christmas present early so that she could defeat 
princes and their white horses; Tsubomi, who had acted so odd lately; 
Tsubomi, who had gone home earlier on her scooter, alone, without 
restraint, without rebuke, without...goodbye.  And then Yaya had 
realized what a fool she had been, had looked at Hikari with a look of 
infinite tenderness, had kissed her on the cheek, had breathed &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry&quot; - and then had fled into the cold scooter-less night to look for 
an elfin figure with dusky pink hair. 

~~~~~

Yaya walked into the darkened apartment and found Tsubomi&#39;s moonlit 
silhouette nestled against the window. Pain-filled eyes looked at Yaya 
as she approached, but there was only quiet dignity in Tsubomi&#39;s voice 
when she asked, &quot;Where&#39;s Hikari-senpai?&quot;

Yaya ignored the question, and knelt in front of the younger woman. &quot;Why 
did you send her to me, Tsubomi?&quot;

Tsubomi hung her head in response; in her hand, she held out a 
sketchbook towards Yaya.

It was the first time Yaya had seen the drafts of Tsubomi&#39;s work.  They 
weren&#39;t the finished faceless sketches Tsubomi always showed her, but 
page upon page of full-bodied drawings; the lines of the clothes rough 
and endlessly revised, but the lines of her face and body - Yaya&#39;s face 
and body - always lovingly and flawlessly penciled in.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to scare you away.&quot; Tsubomi spoke softly. &quot;I knew you&#39;d 
been alone so long...I thought it was a miracle that I even managed to 
get so close. I didn&#39;t want to risk what we already had.&quot;

&quot;Tsubomi.&quot; Yaya gently tipped the younger woman&#39;s chin up. &quot;What gave 
you the idea that I still wanted Hikari after all this time?&quot;

Confusion filled Tsubomi&#39;s face. &quot;That afternoon by the tree...And the 
way you looked at her earlier tonight...Didn&#39;t you...Don&#39;t you want 
her?&quot;

Yaya laughed softly, tenderness in her voice. &quot;That afternoon by the 
tree was just a random thought, Tsubomi. And earlier tonight I was just 
so...shocked to see her after all this time. And even if, by some 
miracle, she really did want me tonight, the way I wanted her so many 
years ago, I would have said no. Because you&#39;re the one that I want, 
Tsubomi. And if I&#39;ve held back from saying it or showing it for so long, 
it&#39;s because I was afraid too. You&#39;re the only one who&#39;s meant anything 
to me in such a long time...I didn&#39;t want to risk ruining what we had 
either.&quot;

Tears were running openly on Tsubomi&#39;s cheeks by then, but her eyes were 
smiling. &quot;You...You blockhead,&quot; she whispered, throwing herself into 
Yaya&#39;s arms. &quot;No wonder a stupid white horse with a prince on top beat 
you.&quot;

Yaya laughed. &quot;One of these days, that mouth of yours is really going to 
get you into trouble.&quot;

&quot;Then make it stop.&quot; Tsubomi said simply. Yaya obliged. </pre>
