<p>“Honestly, I  can’t believe her.” Momomi sighed in exasperation and gesticulated  vaguely. “You know… patience isn’t her strongest point, and jealousy is  her sin. When she gets jealous, she’s really bad. I suppose I should be  glad in a way, though, at least I’m worth jealousy to her.”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”  Shion teased. “I thought you were very sure she was jealous about  Ohtori-san. You were very emphatic about that point. And others.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You heard?” Momomi asked, blushing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everyone heard,” Olesa noted, writing down notes on the text in front of her in small, neat handwriting. “You were very loud.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. I was just… you know… the kind of anger where you loose your sense of place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course.” Shion smirked. “Well, you can rest easy on one point, Kiyashiki-san. You gave as good as you got.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned. “If you say that it’s even worse… I just hope no one was listening too closely. That could be embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  more people got the gist than the detail,” Shion said. “But only  someone who went to a lot of effort, talking to a lot of different  people, would get the full picture.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone like you, then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki-san  knows me far too well.” Shion shrugged. “Well, only someone who knew  you could do that. The fragments of the truth are, as ever, obscured by  reams of rumour, speculation and plain fiction, which suits both of us  well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t it a journalist’s wet dream to have a monopoly on the truth?” Momomi mused. “They call it a scoop, don’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More or less,” Olesa agreed. “This matter would be easier if the truth was known to anyone. You two are very difficult people.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi snorted. “Yeah, like you can talk. More importantly, what are people saying?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Broadly, that you’ve broken up with Kenjou-kun for Ohtori-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned. “Really? You’ve got to be screwing with me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  afraid not.” Shion smiled. “People like theatre, Kiyashiki-san. That’s  why we’re here to work on this playscript, and that’s why what sounds  interesting will always displace the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so, that  account is based on so many incorrect assumptions it’s quite funny,”  Olesa said, her tone solemn. “It should correct itself as more facts  become apparent. Amane-san, too, has no desire for that hypothesis to  become the accepted one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not like she talks to  people enough to confirm things one way or the other.” Momomi sighed  again. “She’s certainly troublesome in that respect. If only people  could approach her and ask her these things, I wouldn’t be in this fix  in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that will clear itself up.” Shion  leaned forwards. “More importantly, what about you and Kaname? How are  things between you? That row sounded pretty bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, well, like  I said, Kaname’s good at overreacting,” Momomi mumbled. “So I guess in  the end it sounded worse than it actually was. Our studying together  started awkwardly but by the end we were pretty much the same as  always.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? I thought that might be the case.” Shion folded  her arms and nodded wisely. “You two are always having little fights,  and big ones too, but you’re both stubborn enough to scrape by.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  were better in the church, as well. If a little tense.” Olesa tapped  her pencil against her book without looking up. “You two appear to live  on tension.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But not romantic tension, unfortunately.” Momomi  flicked through her own copy of Twelfth Night without really taking any  of it in. “In any case, I assured her that Amane wasn’t the same as her  to me. In a roundabout way. But I think she got it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You two  never talk directly, do you? It’s not good for you.” Shion shook her  head. “Being implicit about that stuff leads to misunderstandings, and  then those rows you have which finally clear the air after too much  misunderstanding has been built up. Isn’t it easier to just explicitly  tell her that you still prefer her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname isn’t good with  sincerity, to be honest.” Momomi sighed. “Neither am I, of course. But  I think she understood. Certainly, she was more cheerful. But her  misapprehensions, if nothing else, are troublesome. I seriously didn’t  deserve any of that. Well, maybe the one thing-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The one thing?” Olesa queried.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, nothing. It’s not important. But when she’s jealous, it really is problematic, you know. Well, you all saw it anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  is good, is it not? It’s an encouraging sign.” Olesa frowned. “Even if  her disproportionate response is troubling for you, it shows the  strength of her possessive feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if you say that, I  think half of it was how incensed she was that I spent time with Amane,  of all people.” Momomi sighed. “I knew things would turn out this way,  and that she’d want to kill me. But as for the rest, I’m her first real  friend. We shouldn’t be surprised if she wants to spend time with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Spending  time is one thing. Monopolizing you is something else altogether.  Twenty minutes in one breaktime does not warrant that response.” Shion  shook her head again, smiling in mock despair. “Honestly, Momomi, if  even you are willing to make excuses for her, what hope do we have?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not a matter of excuses,” Momomi replied doggedly. “This is about  realism. It’s better to accept things as they are and move on than get  wrapped up in wishful thinking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sometimes accepting or even  considering a more positive outcome is more difficult than continuing  with the negative outcome you’ve grown accustomed too.” Olesa glanced  at her. “It’s unusual, is it not? To show such a strong desire to stay  around another person… that’s generally considered undignified and  embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Kenjou-kun has a lot of dignity and is easily  embarrassed,” Shion added. “At the very least, her passion is a mark of  her esteem for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just Kaname. She’s an intense and  jealous person.” Momomi closed her eyes and leaned back. “Her rival’s  Amane, as well. So she wouldn’t just accept it. That doesn’t mean  anything, though. It’s just who she is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion sighed. “Well, whatever you say. You know her better than anyone, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa looked up briefly. “Sometimes the outsider sees most of the game.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, that’s how I feel.” Momomi ran a hand through her fringe and  looked down, sighing. “And when I think about that, I do have to wonder  why I’m doing this. I don’t believe she has any hidden feelings to draw  out, and it’s already caused a huge row. Why bother?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  Kenjou-kun appears to be as clingy as a winter cold.” Shion laughed.  “And not the kind Olesa had for a day, a proper one. The kind that can  leave a handful of students left in the classroom like survivors of a  great war, their numbers dwindling one by one as the casualties mount  and the rest look around them and wonder who will be next... do I sound  like Kenjou?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Needs more irrelevance,” Olesa replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. You’re right,” Shion mused. “And irreverence, for that matter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  not being clingy, or anything. That’s not a word that works with her.”  Momomi shrugged. “So perhaps she’s a little possessive, but I’m used to  that. I quite like it, in a way, because it makes me feel needed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if you enjoy that, isn’t that a second-best feeling? To put it  bluntly.” Shion closed her eyes. “Perhaps I’m completely off the mark,  but that’s the way it seems to me. Someone who’s only a friend, even  someone who is a best friend, shouldn’t object just because you spent  your breaktime with someone else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shouldn’t and don’ts and that  kind of definition work doesn’t go well with us.” Momomi shrugged.  “Kaname herself said it. Our relationship is weird, and she doesn’t  mind it staying that way. I’m inclined to agree with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa glanced at her again. “Even if you say that, it sounds like an excuse. Her attitude isn’t healthy as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi rolled her eyes. “Well, it’s not like your relationship with Amiki is any different. Don’t you monopolize her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not saying you shouldn’t be close. But Amiki has kendo, and I go riding  with Ohtori-san from time to time.” Olesa smiled thinly. “And when I do  that, she lets me be. Isn’t that different?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For now. Kaname will get used to it, I’m sure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  precisely why you need to continue,” Shion argued. “She does need to  get used to it. And having exactly one friend who she’s with all of the  time… that’s no good for her, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why not?” Momomi demanded. “She’s fine the way she is, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Regardless  of your own feelings, wouldn’t it be better if more people liked and  accepted her?” Shion shrugged. “She’s had a troubled time, but you’re  someone who can reach her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She said once, being alone in itself  isn’t a worse choice than any other.” Momomi glared. “I agree. So it’s  her choice to make.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion nodded briefly. “If that’s what you  think, it’s fine. But keep talking to Amane for now. How much harm can  that cause? You were sure yourself, you weren’t in the wrong, now were  you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, no,” Momomi admitted. “But-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you’re not in  the wrong, you shouldn’t compromise. Backing out now would more or less  be surrendering to her. Wouldn’t that be a bit of a waste after noisily  defying her only a few hours ago?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not like Kaname, who sees  everything so personally. Things can be better for both of us.” Momomi  closed her eyes, remembering something Amane had said earlier. “It’s  not a zero sum thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like I said, humoring Kenjou-kun right  now might actually be bad for her. Besides, aren’t you just making  excuses for yourself?” Shion shrugged. “It may be your business, but I  can still worry. I don’t want a principled person like you forgetting  who you are to make life easier, and I’m sure Kenjou-kun is the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  make everything so dramatic,” Momomi retorted. “For a start, I don’t  have many principles, and most of them are selfish or at least  self-serving.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That goes for everyone,” Olesa replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  snorted. “I hope not, if nothing else. But that’s not the point, and I  do take your point. It would be a little anticlimactic to back out now,  right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion nodded. “To say the least. But I’m glad. I don’t know what we’d do if Kaname got used to having everything her way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean, if she was like Amane?” Momomi quipped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,” Shion agreed. “But you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane  is like that. Kaname’s more or less the opposite.” Momomi made a face,  twisting a lock of her hair between her fingers. “They’re both very  strange, that much is for sure. But that’s what interests me about  them…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can sympathise with that thought; I’m the same, I’m only really interested in eccentrics.” Shion smiled innocently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose like attracts like in that respect, whatever proverbs say.”  Momomi sighed. “No, it can be the other way round, too. If I wrote  axioms, it’d be <em>people aren’t like magnets</em>. Nothing’s that simple, that’s all there is to say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  way isn’t nearly so dramatic, though. I said it earlier, people like  drama.” Shion laughed. “Actually, that brings us full circle, doesn’t  it? Perhaps we should get back to the play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glared sidelong at her. “I notice you didn’t refute the implication that you’re as weird, if not weirder, than I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  some things are that simple. Why deny a simple truth?” Shion returned  to her own copy of the play. “So have you decided on how to prepare the  script?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll translate most of it, and cut it down and out  only where we have to.” Olesa closed her eyes. “That makes for more  flexible editing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That also means more work for us,” Momomi  complained, picking up her book. “You’re really charging cumulative  interest on that favour of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure Kiyashiki-san will  forgive me. It’s a chance for her to exercise her great talents, after  all. Besides, your work ends with the completed text, unless you choose  to audition. I’ll have a lot more to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Remind me why you’re doing this, will you?” Momomi frowned. “Is it for Spica, or somesuch?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  looks like it will be interesting, doesn’t it?” Shion smiled and  shrugged. “Aside from that, it’s not like I enjoy being the weird one  who talks to second-years, either. Acknowledgement is a wonderful  thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So if this is a big hit, you’ll fly off and leave us, is that it?” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would that worry you, Kiyashiki-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That would be ungrateful of you, so I wouldn’t forgive you. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I feel loved.” Shion smirked. “That’s echoing praise from you, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. Say what you like, just don’t get too up yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, after you’re done I’ll have even more to worry about.  Principally, casting.” Shion frowned. “This is a chance for you to have  me in your debt, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? So you want my talents again?” Momomi shook her head. “As demanding as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  quite. If you appear, it’ll be for yourself. You’re not much different  from me in terms of reputation. It’s your silver tongue I want to  borrow.” Shion leaned forwards slightly. “Ohtori-san… an outstanding  person like her is likely a good actor. Even if she isn’t, her  reputation is enough, provided she can be persuaded to come at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  I’m being used already, am I?” Momomi sighed and raised her hands in  mock defeat. “If I manage it, Kaname will kill me. But it’s not like I  can really influence her at all anyway. I’ll mention it, but that’s all  I can do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose she wouldn’t be Ohtori-san if she wasn’t so difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  then, you’ll have to be patient. I can’t make it seem like I want her  for that.” Momomi laughed. “Amane appears to have a complex like that.  She spent a lot of time and effort making sure I wasn’t romantically  interested in her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like her,” Olesa noted quietly. “But one can hardly blame her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  quite. But she’s smart.” Momomi frowned. “That much should be obvious,  I know. But I never really connected the grades to the person until  today. If nothing else, she can lead a conversation and regain the  initiative well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. She is herself, after all.” Olesa  smiled slightly. “That’s another of her interesting things… you should  never take her indifferent laziness for lack of talent. She has a sharp  mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You talk about her a lot… well, a lot more than you talk  about anything else.” Momomi leaned forwards, prodding Olesa. “Are you  sure you’re not one of her fangirls?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She is interesting, but  more importantly she is restful company.” Olesa closed her eyes. “No  assumptions, no demands. That’s why she is useful to you too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what I find weird, though. For our own bizarre reasons, it makes sense  for us to talk to her. It’s not like we’re too interested in what  everyone else is. But that’s the one thing I don’t understand. An  antisocial person like her, what does she gain?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shrugged her shoulders easily. “I’ve never been certain. Perhaps she’s just lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “I don’t understand her at all… that’s surprisingly irritating.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t look at me,” Shion said. “It’s you we’re counting on, Kiyashiki-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “No pressure, then? Well, I’ll see what I can do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed as she changed into her new kendo uniform, leaning against the wall with one hand. <em>Even  if things worked out okay in the end, I suppose I went too far this  time. I’m just glad Momomi’s forgiving. But it did irritate me, and it  still irritates me. That’s what worries me. It feels like we haven’t  actually settled anything, just thrust it out of sight for now. More  than that, why am I so worried by this? If that’s because of Amane, my  obsession really is so strong it’s almost pathetic. But two  explanations that immediately spring to mind… aren’t ones that I want  to consider, even now. I don’t think they’re too likely either. I just  wish I had Momomi’s certainty. She knows who she is, that’s what she  says… if only I was the same. So I like her company, but that doesn’t  have to make me gay. It’s the same when I say she’s beautiful, those  are the words of an observant friend. I’m sure of it. Mostly. I’m still  nothing like Momomi in that respect. </em>She sighed. <em>Am I just  being stubborn or oblivious? I’m not sure whether that would be good or  bad… Amiki sounds so naïve, though. Some things are impossible. But  just because she said that, I’m being forced to think like this. What  am I supposed to do, to confirm it? Date Momomi? Like hell I’m going to  do that, I have my pride. Besides, it wouldn’t be… kind, I don’t think,  especially if I have to say no after all. But what else am I going to  do? Date someone else? That would be even crueler, not to mention  there’s no one I could even ask. It’s so bothersome to think about.  When people question even that about me, it’s like, I don’t know,  philosophy. When you’re thinking that way, there isn’t anything that  can be taken as assured. And while I’m stuck here wondering, Momomi  will probably keep talking to Amane. Which really annoys me, and I’ve  just gone round in a big circle… again. Between one thing and another,  I’ve been doing that all day.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you actually came back. I’m surprised. I’d hoped that I’d scared you away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  glanced at the sixth-year and snorted. “Don’t feel too disappointed. I  came this time because I want to see whether the real club leader’s all  she’s cracked up to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maya looked imperiously down at her.  “Quite the arrogant one, aren’t we? You should be grateful to  Kariya-sama. If it was up to me, we wouldn’t have someone like you in  the club at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bet. Well, I hope I don’t offend your delicate sensitivities.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all. This way, I can make you suffer, if nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  folded her arms and closed her eyes. “I’ll look forwards to your best  efforts. Then I’ll show you just how is it is for someone like me to  learn your precious art. It’ll be easy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something long and hard prodded her in the back of the head. “Stop acting all cool, Kenjou. It’s annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That isn’t a toy, Rivera-san. Don’t just mess around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But senpai, it’s so fun to poke her. See?” Amiki prodded Kaname a few more times in the back for good measure.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t mess with me!” Kaname snapped, turning angrily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s enough,” Maya barked. “Show some restraint, or I’ll have you separated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry, senpai. It’s just our way of showing love.” Amiki shouldered her bamboo sword. “In any case, where’s Kariya-sama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her  council meeting is running late, so she won’t be with us at the start,”  Maya explained. “As much as it pains me, I’ll be teaching you warts  again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch. I only came to see her fight.” Kaname scowled. “I might as well go if that’s the case.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Someone who can’t even touch Amiki isn’t worth Kariya-sama’s time to teach. That’s what I think, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I object to the implications of that sentence,” Amiki muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I object to that sentence.” Kaname folded her arms. “Kariya invited me her herself, so evidently she disagrees with you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  I think she just wanted a chance to hit you with a bokken, after all  the noise you made earlier. God, that was annoying.” Amiki rolled her  eyes. “Get a room if you’re going to have a big lover’s tiff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname growled. “You’re still saying crap like that? You really do like to deny reality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if I’m judging by the way you reacted to her and-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maya  coughed, then smacked the floor between them with her sword. “You two  need to get a room as well. Shut up and get into the dojo before I  throw you out for disrupting my club!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki sighed as she  trooped out next to Kaname, looking around and lowering her voice.  “Honestly, she’s definitely cut of the same cloth as Kariya-sama.  That’s the bad side of kendo. It may be one of the more practical and  physical clubs but it attracts people like her, and you for that  matter. People with troublesome attitudes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, like you’re any different,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps  not, but it’s still troublesome. I’m used to having at least a few  people to take advantage of, if need be.” Amiki glanced sidelong at  Kaname. “But how about it? You totally lost it about Momomi talking to  Amane, so are you still going to bother telling me that you’re not in  the least bit interested in her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t screw with me,” Kaname muttered. “I was just annoyed she chose Amane just to get back at me. It’s not very mature.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She can befriend who she likes. It’s not like you own her or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s still such a thing as consideration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Consideration? In what way? You’d be going overboard if you were her girlfriend, speaking like that. And you’re just a friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t like that just a friend thing, it’s annoying,” Kaname growled.  “That doesn’t mean I’m not entitled to an opinion. I’ll speak how I  like, whatever she is to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, even if you say you’re a  friend, you’re an extremely jealous friend.” Amiki smirked. “I dread to  think about what you’ll be like when she finally does get a girlfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who  the hell is going to be that to her? Ice prince Amane?” Kaname folded  her arms. “Not even I’m that blind. That won’t happen.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  pretty, clever and single. Besides, if she keeps this up, she might end  up pretty popular. At the very least, people know her and her name now.  Associating with Amane has that effect on people.” Amiki leaned on he  bamboo sword. “And dating Momomi could become an attractive move.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like she’ll ever let that happen. She’s as bad as Amane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  pretty arrogant, Kenjou. She’s never known many people here, so someone  might surprise her.” Amiki closed her eyes. “And when that happened, a  friend would have to accept that they come second now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  joke around. That’s about as likely as Olesa dating someone.” Kaname  folded her arms. “It’s not something I’ll ever actually face, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you think that, you’re leaving yourself wide open to a very unpleasant surprise,” Amiki snapped. “Get serious, Kenjou.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. You’re the one who needs to get serious. You’ll say anything you think will get me jealous, won’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  right now I’m trying to bring you out of denial. Probably because it’s  funny to make you realise that the world isn’t as comfortable as you  think it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maya cut them off and set them to work practicing  basic movements. She pointedly sent Amiki to the other side of the room  and focused her attention on Kaname. “Now show some discipline. This  isn’t a social club.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m aware of that,” Kaname retorted. “In fact, I’m indebted to you for getting her out of my hair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t answer back! And fix your grip! It’s too low! The point’s moving too much, as well. Hold it steady!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,  right.” Kaname sighed, swinging the sword down and shouting with  everyone else. Maya made a few more corrections then walked on,  apparently appeased for now. Kaname sneaked a glance after her and  watched the others at work with a sense of discouragement. Even though  she was hardly an expert, even she could see the difference between her  and the others. <em>This is just a matter of practice, though. It will  come quickly enough. And most of them are older, anyway, so I have time  on my side. The only problem is Amiki, who isn’t bad at all. Well, if  she was no good that would just be boring. I prefer having a decent  rival. </em>The sword swung down. <em>I wonder whether Amane ever  thought something like that… whatever. Who cares what she thinks about  me? It’s not like I’m any worse than she is. And I manage to have a few  friends, as well, which is more than she does. So she’s more popular  than I am, but what does that matter? That’s only because she’s the  goddamn aristocrat who rides a horse and acts all diffuse and polite.  It’s easy for her; she gets worshipped just for that. Momomi, too… it  wasn’t exactly hard for her to play the same tedious game. Is that what  she meant? That she’s different from me? Screw her, if she’s talking  about that kind of difference she can keep it. Even if popularity comes  easier for them, that’s just their birth. It’s not anything to be proud  of. </em>Kaname carried on practicing the sword swings, trying to force her mind into the rhythm of the repetitive action. <em>That’s  something that worries me, though, as much as her spending time with  Amane. How can I say that to anyone, though, least of all her? It’s  just too insecure and pathetic. But still, I don’t like those words.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  few minutes later, Kariya strode in, bamboo sword under one arm and  helmet under the other. “Sorry I’m late. Spica and Miator were  bickering like schoolchildren, just as ever. God, it’s annoying.” Her  gaze swept the room, stopping briefly on Kaname before moving on. “So  we’re all here. Are they all warmed up, Maya?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Etoile-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good.  Well, I’m in a bad mood right now, so I’m taking it out on you guys. No  complaints.” Kariya’s gaze swept round again. “Especially from you,  Kenjou. One of the great things about this club is I can hit you  repeatedly over a head with a long wooden object and you don’t even  have the right to complain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Etoile-sama,” Kaname replied, sarcasm riding on the edge of her words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright. Begin in the usual pairs. Maya, oversee the group. I’ll work with Kenjou to start with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Etoile-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya  inspected the group again as they moved, finding space and pairing up  against opponents of roughly equal ages. Then she turned and walked  towards Kaname, stopping and giving her a calculating look. “So you did  come.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said this before, but anyone who thought I’d run away  was stupid.” Kaname glowered. “But I didn’t think the Etoile was  supposed to be a bully. Looking around and then at you, you have  something of an age advantage/”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I lead a practical club, with a  lot of emphasis on sparring. If you just want to kill time and get some  exercise, join the track club. We’re serious here.” Kariya shouldered  her weapon. “That’s my attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right. That doesn’t change the age problem, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  far too cheeky, Kenjou. Be glad I’m indulgent.” Kariya looked down at  her with a sublime confidence. “But it’s pointless to spar if you have  no skill or training. Then you’re just wasting time. That’s why I’ll  train you, along with Maya, until you’re worth the time of Rivera or  anyone else here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So that’s the way it is, is it?” Kaname narrowed her eyes. “Well, that’s fine. I’ll learn quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  would do well to do so. But I want to see where you are right now,  first.” Kariya slid her helmet on and took a stance. “Come at me and  I’ll see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is totally unfair,” Kaname protested. But she  placed her own helmet on, raised her bamboo sword and attacked with  considerable enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">First she attempted a sweep towards  Kariya’s head, but the Etoile easily blocked with a single smooth  motion and pushed forwards, knocking her off-balance. Kaname stepped  back quickly, raising her sword to block a counter-attack, but Kariya  just stood there, watching. Frowning, she adjusted her grip and  attempted to attack again, striking three times in rapid succession at  Kariya’s midriff. The Etoile effortlessly parried, then slid her left  foot back and brought her sword to the horizontal to block a vicious  downwards slice. She supported the bamboo sword with her other hand,  pushing Kaname back again. A moment later she twisted her body and  feinted towards the younger girl. Kaname jumped back hurriedly, sword  raised to avoid an attack that never came. She scowled and pressed  forwards again. “Don’t joke around!” Her sword struck out repeatedly,  high, low and centrally, no longer aiming for specific parts of the  body but simply to break through Kariya’s defenses. The older girl  warded her off without apparent effort, smooth, simple movements that  completely stonewalled Kaname’s attacks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And suddenly, she was reminded of a memory. <em>When  I first started with karate, it was at my mother’s insistence, to  control my violent tendencies. But I came to like it, because I was  good at it. Before long, I could beat anyone my age. </em>Kaname tried to drive the point of her sword home but Kariya sidestepped and blocked the attack. <em>Except for this one kid, who took it really seriously.</em><em>He’d  done it a lot more than me. And he was never vicious, never flamboyant,  never aggressive, just efficient. Somehow he’d go through me and take  me down in the simplest way possible, never wasting any energy at all.  This is just the same. </em>She frowned and slowed slightly, launching probing strikes and watching Kariya’s response. <em>Yes,  that’s right. She lets me do all the moving. She just moves her feet  and her body as slightly as necessary, and everything’s perfectly  precise. She knows everything I can do and how to beat it, because  she’s done this a thousand times before. Even if I can’t match that  experience, I can at least recognise it. </em>Kaname launched one more  attack at Kariya’s face, but the older girl batted it aside and  suddenly moved. A quick step forwards, and she took advantage of a  moment’s weakness and struck through, hitting the younger girl on the  side of the head. The shout was perfectly timed, and she easily pulled  back and brought the sword to guard again. <em>If someone takes this so seriously, there’s no shame in losing to that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see.” Kariya bowed briefly and waited for Kaname to return the gesture  before she took off her helmet again. “Pretty much what I’d expected.  You’re strong for your age and your speed and stamina both appear  fairly good. In terms of technique, however, you’re abysmal. You’re  basically waving your weapon in my direction and hoping for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you have every conceivable advantage,” Kaname retorted. “What do you want me to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  get offended. Like I said, this was what I expected. If you have the  dedication, I can have you learn. I’ve taught worse, if better  disciplined, pupils.” Kariya shook her hair out. “Well, we’ll take a  break here. You need to calm down before I can drill you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever. You just wanted a chance to show off…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Watch  your mouth. I certainly have nothing to gain by impressing you.” Kariya  folded her arms severely. “Now tell me, Kenjou, did you at least follow  my advice?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your advice? You didn’t give me any, except shut up and learn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not that.” Kariya shook her head impatiently. “I told you to thank Kiyashiki. You know why. Did you find your manners?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  frowned deeply. “Honestly, just when I finally managed to forget all  that complex stuff for a while you have to bring it up again…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not an answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, in a manner of speaking… not yet. It kinda slipped my mind, and she’s given me a lot more to worry about, so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  mean it was difficult and so you stalled until it felt too late to  mention.” Kariya gave her a cynical glance. “You’re hopeless, Kenjou. I  don’t like saying that people deserve unhappiness but you’ve never  shown me much that you’ve done to deserve what happiness you have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bridled. “Well, no one asked you, you know. I don’t know why I have to take your orders anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  give advice, not orders. If you’re too stupid to take it I’m not going  to chase you.” Kariya gave her a severe look. “But you remain a  problem, Kenjou, for ever changing reasons. Quite the scene you two  made in the canteen earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God, do I have to explain that again? I’m sick of it. If you say it’s because I’m jealous-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  could care less about explanations. It’s nothing I’m interested in.”  Kariya glared at her. “I won’t hold your hand or think for you. It’s  something you have to deal with yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That suits me just fine, so shut up about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,  by the sound of it, you do have an awful lot of thinking to do,  yourself. I suggest you think everything over, long and hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, as if I haven’t been doing that all day…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then perhaps you’re thinking too much. Someone like you flips between those two extremes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s very pat. You can have it both ways, like that.” Kaname snorted. “Besides, you’re the same kind of person, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All  the more reason to listen to me, if that’s true. But someone like you,  more independent than most students here, should understand. It’s your  problem.” Kariya drew herself up slightly. “That means you have to  solve it. Not run away inelegantly, as you’ve been doing up until now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like hell. What do you know, anyway? You said yourself, you aren’t interested.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, and on that note, I’m moving on. Pick up your sword, Kenjou. I’m going to teach you how to use it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname moved to comply, face still flushed from the uncomfortable pressure. <em>Somehow,  even when Kariya’s saying that, it still feels a lot more invasive than  Amiki’s blunt attack. Just like their kendo, I suppose. But even if I  hate it, I take her point. If I’m thinking this much, there is a  problem. And I’ll solve it, my way.</em></span></p>
