<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi staggered slightly, wincing as the buckets lacerated her hands. <em>I’m  not cut out for this. I’m totally not cut out for this. This is menial  physical labour, for Christ’s sake! I should have people to do this  stuff.</em> She sighed and struggled on, biting her lip. <em>But isn’t it  just a little pathetic that I can barely make this distance, while  Amiki was able to get all the way in a third of the time and double  back to help Olesa? What kind of girl is she, anyway? It isn’t ladylike  at all…well, Kaname would be the same, but she has a reason. Who is  Amiki, anyway? I always focused on Olesa, but I don’t know much about  her. Was I looking in the wrong place? No, Olesa would have covered  Amiki’s tracks for her, such as they would be. Like Kaname and I. Come  to that, I wonder whether Kaname would help me with this? </em>She smiled at her own thoughts. <em>Yeah,  right. Don’t get too wishful, Momomi. If she did it, it’d be to  emphasise her supremacy. I’d definitely refuse to let her help me.  Well, probably, but my body’s hurting. Water’s so heavy; it’s just not  fair. </em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, hurry it up already,” Amiki said, watching her struggle. “You’re hopeless, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well… forgive me…” Momomi muttered. “Someone bruised me in every conceivable place just recently, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, I pulled the punches. You’d be in a hospital otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A great thing to say after the fact,” Momomi noted caustically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  staggered on, finally reaching the other two. She dropped the buckets  without ceremony, splashing some of the water across the floor. She was  already sweating heavily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot. Mop that up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t have to tell me.” She started to mop up after herself, cursing Kariya in a variety of inventive ways.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They fell to work, starting to mop the floor first because that was easy. Supposedly. Momomi sighed. <em>I’m  sure actual cleaners don’t have to use buckets like this. They must  have it better organised. But our school is obscure about punishments.  Why do I want to stay here again?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll cover the left section, you can do the right,” Amiki said to Olesa. “Is that fine?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  grip is wrong,” Amiki chided. “Spread your hands a bit more, and hold  it further up the shaft. That way you won’t have to bend your back to  reach the floor.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Here, I’ll show you. Like  that.” Amiki leaned over, moving Olesa’s hands slightly, then stepping  back and picking up her own mop again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks,” Olesa said, getting to work again. Momomi tried to imitate her new position as surreptitiously as possible.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can’t believe that Kariya, though,” Amiki continued. “Making us do this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Too hard for you? </em>That’s  what Momomi would have said. But she was saving her breath, it would be  too obviously hypocritical, and somehow, she didn’t feel comfortable  with saying that right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa shrugged. “It’s to be expected. That’s the way this school is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  doesn’t make it right,” Amiki said. “You shouldn’t be doing this. It’s  as simple as that. Why don’t we have normal punishments?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood,”  Amiki said. She looked around, checking the hall. “The Sister’s gone  and there’s no sign of anyone else. How about you take a break and let  me work for now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell?” Momomi said. “Do I get to do that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. You’re not Perez-sa-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amiki!” Olesa said with uncharacteristic sharpness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re not Perez-san,” Amiki finished. “I’m definitely not pampering you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks, Amiki. But there’s no need to go that far.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  carried on with her work, staring thoughtfully at the two. Amiki was  definitely behaving weirdly. She’d always known that the girl was just  a dumb lackey to Olesa, but to go this far was astounding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  punishment makes sense exactly because it’s difficult for me, though,”  Olesa commented analytically. “The student body is overwhelmingly upper  class or upper middle class in makeup. We have no practical skills.  This is an exercise in tedium and perspective targeted at our  weaknesses. It’s also demeaning. Perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so,” Amiki  replied. “What irks me most of all is that we know the Etoiles were  basically behind it. Being punished by the Serané and Kariya is almost  outrageous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we can aspire to that position. All the same,  you have a point. Third daughter, indeed. She is… strange, though. I  don’t understand her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s there to understand? She’s just a airhead in love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  what’s strange,” Olesa said. “She’s from that family, but to fall in  love with another girl? No matter the pedigree, it’s an odd thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Amiki said slowly, scratching her nose. “I guess it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t  you the one crushing on Amane?” Momomi said, feeling obliged to speak  up for the first time. She wasn’t quite sure why. Probably just the  hypocrisy of the thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t give me that crap. It’s one thing to start a mad rumour, but believing your own mad rumour is just insane.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, she hasn’t answered. And doesn’t that go for your babble about me and Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It would not be necessary to like Amane to use Amane,” Olesa noted. “I’m surprised you’d forget so fundamental a fact.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s a feeling I have. I’m inclined to trust my feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trust me,” Olesa said. “There are many reasons aside from an obscure theory about Amane to explain why I hate you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  yawned hugely. “That’s another thing about these punishments, though.  They don’t properly punish brats like Kaname who’ve probably washed  floors all their lives anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve no right to say something like that. That’s what’s wrong. We’re the brats, not her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  are not permitted to be brats, and you know it,” Olesa said.  “Exceptional privilege is brought at the price of our freedom. You are  the only one obnoxious enough to try and retain both.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s impossible. I know that. I’ve decided I want freedom more, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your family has always behaved with shocking irresponsibility.” Olesa frowned. “I suppose this is expected from bad blood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bad  blood? What does that even mean? And I don’t care what you say. I don’t  intend to walk the path my parents laid out for me just to please them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  have no idea what it means to be a noble,” Olesa said, her grip on her  mop tightening. “Just doing what you like because it pleases you and  you’re rich anyway, it’s an indulgence only you can afford.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  stopped too, turning and facing her. “I didn’t ask to be rich! But now  I intend to do what I please, because I can. I may end up poor, but  I’ll make it my responsibility!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This conversation ends here,”  Amiki said, stepping between them and facing Momomi. “Or I’ll open some  of those bruises. Understand?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What got into you?” Momomi demanded. “Kaname cut you that badly?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say what you like,” Amiki spat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They returned to their work in a tense atmosphere. Momomi fumed. <em>That  bitch Olesa. What kind of freak is she? Duty this and responsibility  that… it makes me sick! What the hell does it have to do with her? How  do aristocrats even make sense in the modern age? We’re just relics,  nothing more than that. But some people take it way too seriously. And  Amiki acting like her fricking knight-errant or something. Makes me  sick.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa was looking moody as well, insofar as any  emotions showed on her mask-like face. She washed the floor in a  methodical silence, facing downwards and affecting ignorance of the  other two. Amiki gave Momomi a glare that neatly conveyed enough  killing intent to intimidate an army corps before turning to her friend  again. “You know what the worst thing is? It’s not like they’ll stop  giving us homework. At the end of it, I’ll be amazed if we have any  leisure time at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Quite,” Olesa murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  troublesome…” Amiki stretched idly, leaning on her mop. “I have to do  that history essay, I left it until late again. Who cares about what a  bunch of Europeans did anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That reminds me </em>Momomi said. <em>I forgot to write that one, as well. It’s no good if my zeal to stay here means I don’t do the work they’re oh-so-keen on.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me  too,” Olesa said. “I can help.” She spoke as if each word was a  physical effort, her eyes far away, further into her shell than Momomi  had ever seen before. And that was saying something. Olesa had more  layers than an onion, and they ran just as deep. She was somewhere in  the centre right now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks,” Amiki replied, giving up. Evidently, she, too, had noticed the exodus of Olesa’s consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Thoughts within thoughts. She’s like me, in a way, </em>Momomi thought. <em>But  it’s not that Olesa actively deceives. She is, by her own nature,  enigmatic and silent. Why is that? We’re aristocrats, we’re  extroverted, arrogant, social, out-going, or we can fake it so well as  to pass. But she’s something else. And Amiki…she’s even more stupidly  loyal than I thought. Would Kaname go so far? Stupid, again, I’m not  like Olesa, I don’t need her. But that’s got nothing to do with wants,  either.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They carried on in an echoing, awkward silence for  ten minutes by Momomi’s watch, simply working. Occasionally Amiki would  say something and Olesa would make a token response, and that would be  that. Those exchanged were generally followed by Amiki’s trademarked  yakuza stare, the one where she indicated that Momomi was an eyesore  and would be much improved by the amputation of several limbs. It was  not exactly a congenial atmosphere, in short.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m back!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a moment’s echoing silence. “Welcome back,” Momomi said sarcastically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez,  what happened to you guys?” Kaname asked, picking up her mop and  spinning it idly. “Were you the ones who had to spend fifteen minutes  being briefed on the finer points of our Lord in all his divine  radiance, glory, benevolence and all-round obnoxious superiority?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t sound like any of it stuck,” Momomi muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, of course not.” Kaname said got back to work. “The whole thing’s a bit silly, if you ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why do you intend an exclusive Catholic school, if that’s the case?” Amiki asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  thought we’d be praying and stuff all the time, and holding Bible  class, instead of doing actual work. Besides, I never thought this  place had a very serious attitude about religion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why did you think that, then?” Momomi said dutifully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  glad you asked, actually,” Kaname said. “Well, on our open day we  walked into an empty classroom. It was supposed to be empty, I should  say. It actually had two girls in it, frenching. I was glad mother  wasn’t there, circumstantially. And somewhat traumatised myself. I was  only eleven, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just typical of our school,” Amiki sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed too, for a rather different reason. She’d heard that story about  fifty times before, and it got a little better each time. That probably  had something to do with Kaname’s own mental development. No doubt in  years to come she’d talk about how they walked in on two girls doing…  this and that… Momomi blushed at the thought. <em>Looks like I’m not very mature, either, </em>she thought, biting her lip. <em>Kaname talking about that stuff would just be way too weird.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But it’s a moot point, anyway,” Kaname said. “We all know the main religion around here is Etoilism.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  after today’s punishment?” Momomi wondered out loud. “That’s theocracy,  right?” She was just tired and bored enough to go along with Kaname’s  flights of fancy, she decided.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. This school is  theocratically ruled by the Etoiles, who are some kind of fricking  deities incarnate around here… or perhaps it’s a dictatorship of an  absolute oligarchy who use a personality cult to enforce their  position. On the other hand, we do vote for them and they serve a  limited term. So, really, the whole thing’s just your average  democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re remarkably sanguine under the circumstances.” Amiki said. “Didn’t you just get into trouble for rambling on like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, even the Sisters aren’t going to care if I go on about the Etoiles. They’re just not so keen on the Jesus thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, there’s definitely a personality cult around the Etoiles,” Olesa murmured, to Momomi’s surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,”  Kaname said, encouraged. “And always a pair, so always a certain kind  of cult. And the students really have unnatural power in this school,  which they somehow make into a selling point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And the Etoiles fit into that,” Momomi said, catching on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really,  it’s just a kind of pseudo-meritocratic egotism,” Kaname said. “It’s  accepted insofar as everyone wants to be Etoile some day, and there’s a  pretence that it’s a merit selective thing. But, more honestly than in  the student council elections, it’s run as a popularity contest, and  the Etoiles conduct themselves appropriately. It’s a pandering to  adolescent wish fantasy, don’t you think? To be special, like a star.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Incisive analysis, Kenjou-san,” Serané said. “If a little rambling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shit. How long have they been here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Since <em>theocracy</em>,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you didn’t tell me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was funnier this way,” Amiki commented earnestly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s fine,” Kariya shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is?” Amiki said, sounding disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is she wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kariya,” Serané chided. “Is that the proper thing to say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, yes. Well, it is, actually. Honesty is good, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If I can forestall the next round of the Kariya-Serané Show,” Momomi said hurriedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, that’s rich…” Amiki said under her breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you just passing through, or what?” Momomi said. “I need to talk to you afterwards, but you can be hard to find.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Etoiles  only get time alone if they know how to be hard to find,” Kariya  snapped. “It’s part of the job. You’d better get used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  we’ll be overseeing you for some time,” Serané said. “So you can relax  for now, we won’t run off. We’ll call you when you’re taking your  break. In the meantime, we’ll be talking to Tomori-san. She’s a very  patient woman, I’m impressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s a psychotic stalker, that’s what she is,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that a way to talk about your senpai, Kenjou?” Kariya demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, Etoile-sama.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Correct. You can have a break when you’ve finished with the Church, before moving onto the tower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wonderful,” Kaname sighed, defeated.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But, when I look at things…</em>Momomi mused. <em>Kaname  really is good with people. No, that’s not exactly it. She’s rambling,  incoherent and absolutely bizarre when she’s around anyone but me. That  might be her way of dealing with apprehension and social awkwardness.  Well, it is awkward, and it must be especially bad for her. But she a  knack for getting a conversation going, even under the most adverse  circumstances. Even if it’s only everyone bashing her for whatever  stupid thing she’s said last. It’s a bizarre talent. On the other hand,  I’m a perfect conversationalist, and I definitely don’t say weird  things. But I… somehow, it doesn’t translate. The difference is…she  uses her talent, I suppose, but I don’t use mine. I haven’t talked with  Amiki and Olesa, about anything. But even though she’s still bruised  everywhere, even though she says she hates Olesa and Amiki so much,  she’s the one talking. I say that I’m forgiving them, but it’s just for  the plan. On the other hand, if we got on well won’t that make things  smoother? Has Kaname realised that?</em> Momomi sniggered. <em>Or I’m  reading too much into things again and she’s just saying damnfool  things for the sake of it. That’s something I like about her. She’s  smart and dumb at the same time.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s up? You’re zoning out on me,” Kaname said, prodding her with the mop. “Don’t slack off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know, already,” Momomi said, smiling at her. The blue-haired girl  looked a little bemused and turned away, which was even more weirdly  delightful. Sometimes it was nice to forget where Kaname came from and  what she wanted and just enjoy who the girl <em>was</em>. She was an idiot, after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Weird girl,” Kaname said, sounding unnerved.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled, cocking her head slightly, then got back to work. Amiki quirked her eyebrows and carried on too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  watched them for a moment, stopping. Then she lowered her mop. “I’m  going to start work on the clock tower. I need some time alone to  think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, you can’t do that,” Momomi complained. “That’s not fair.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why?” Olesa asked. “I thought you didn’t want to work there. I’ll be saving you effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re only going to slack off if you’re unescorted. You should stay here where I can see you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll go with her,” Amiki said. “We’re only getting in each other’s way, like this. It makes sense, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you can both slack off together?” Kaname snorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That goes for you, too,” Amiki retorted, sounding annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I’m going. The rest is up to you. How about you, Kiyashiki-san, if you’re so worried about this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And leave these two alone together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  my line with you two,” Kaname snorted. “Like anything would happen  then. You’d just get caught up in some complex debate and scheme  strange things. That won’t clean the floors.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you two are  the ones who will get into a big fight and dirty the floor again,”  Momomi snapped. “You’re definitely less productive…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa rolled her eyes. “This isn’t very useful. Kenjou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, if you insist,” Kaname said. “But don’t expect me to go easy on you. No, except the reverse. I don’t like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine. I’ll tolerate your obnoxious personality in turn.” She left, Kaname muttering on her heels.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  watched them go, feeling slightly annoyed. Things were more fun when  Kaname was around, and now she had to be all alone with Amiki. Words  that might in other circumstances been romantic were in this instance  purely and totally concerned with the fact that it might be difficult  for both to leave the room in one peace. Amiki might break her into  little bits, or she might crush the girl’s spirit like the louse it was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, how are you feeling without the crutch of that violent maniac?” Amiki asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?  Well, there’s another one right here, so it’s fine.” Momomi brushed a  lock of her hair back with calculated carelessness. “But don’t get any  funny ideas. You two are working under me, for now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Arrogant, aren’t you? Well, how about I take your precious, flimsy evidence from your pockets after I’ve opened your skull?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure you want to risk Olesa? Try it, if you like. Kaname and her are in the same position. Is it okay to leave them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki snorted. “She can look after herself. If Kaname’s too careless, neither of you will walk away. Trust me on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  are you so loyal to her, anyway? It’s quite pathetic to watch.” Momomi  asked as casually as she could manage. But it was definitely something  she was wondering about. Before she could drive a wedge between their  relationship, she had to understand it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There are those who are clueless, like you. Then there are those who know their place in the world. That’s me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Unexpected from her. I don’t fully understand. </em>“Well,  do you belong in that place?” Momomi carried on mopping, speaking  almost conversationally. “It doesn’t look like Olesa cares much for  your presence. Doesn’t annoy you that she’ll never pay any attention to  you, however much you work for it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki sniggered sardonically. “Not really. Being by her, being useful to her, that’s all I need to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Such a ridiculous attitude. True love, or true idiocy? Isn’t that a tautology, when I think about it? Well…I like a challenge. </em>Momomi smiled serenely and carried on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We  told you,” Kaname said. “No slacking off. You’ve done atrociously  little work as it is. I’m not your pet like Amiki, I won’t wipe your  arse for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let me give you some advice, Kenjou-san. Be careful around Kiyashiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  right.” Kaname stepped up the stairs one at a time, washing them neatly  as they went. “I’m not stupid enough to accept the words of an enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps  I am your enemy,” Olesa agreed, “but that doesn’t mean I don’t have  some observations to make about the one you call your friend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed sardonically and ignored her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know Kiyashiki, because she’s like me,” Olesa said. “I don’t expect you  to believe me, either. But I’ll say it anyway, because I don’t like it  when people are used.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s hypocritical, to say the least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,”  Olesa conceded. “But I can’t work on her level. She said it herself.  She’s a greater liar than I am, that’s what she said. That’s because I  don’t have the audacity to work on people’s emotions. I use the mind  alone, and that’s easy to break from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You sure are noisy all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  continued in her clipped monotone as if nothing had interrupted her  flow. “As you can tell already, Kiyashiki is deft at blackmail, but  more than that… people are attracted to her on some level. Perhaps you  thought yourself special for agreeing to help her. Am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  only thing I consider myself on that is mad, to agree to do such a  bothersome thing,” Kaname said automatically. “Besides, it’s better  than being blackmailed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have been consciously forced into  this,” Olesa said. “But you’re doing this of your free will. I concede  that as far as it goes, but she can still lead you on…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It would  take someone a lot more convincing than Momomi to lead me on, don’t  worry about that,” Kaname said. “You won’t do either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know Kiyashiki-san better than you, that’s all. No, you know her better but I understand her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You, who hasn’t spent five minutes in her presence but as a random and ineffectual antagonist?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why,  aren’t you two enemies?” Olesa said. “It’s the same. But you’d be an  idiot to trust her words at face value. She’s an aristocrat, trained to  take everything she can and give nothing back. It’s a habit she’s  picked up from her father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m used to that. It goes for everyone around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki  is different, she lives in a world of one. I met her a few times before  she came here. She wouldn’t remember me. But she’s always apart. Hasn’t  she told you? About a past in a family she hates, a life dedicated only  to herself?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know about that?” Kaname asked suspiciously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everything.  I know my enemies. But from that environment, she has no inhibitions.  She makes her own life, which sounds romantic at first, but it’s not.”  Olesa closed her eyes. “Haven’t you noticed? She doesn’t care about  anyone around her. Everyone’s a tool to her. Are you naïve enough to  think that you’re somehow special, different?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know all that,”  Kaname said. “Of course she’d regard stupid people like you as capital  to be expended. But I told, I am different, because I’m not stupid  enough to be pulled around on strings like you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On the contrary. Yours are the tightest strings of all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed. “You’re really so very open about trying hopelessly to get at me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can stop me whenever you like,” Olesa replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Carry on,” Kaname challenged. “It’s entertaining.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki’s  using you and everyone else, in the purest sense of the word,” Olesa  said. “We all know that. But we all go along with it, which is her  gift. I’m not telling you to stop helping her or colluding with her.  But do be careful not to get to close to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And why would that be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her  and I alike, seek control. She does that through people’s emotions,  just like her father. She’ll try to get close to all of us. Especially  you. She’ll enjoy the attention. But it’s not sincere, because her  mind’s always elsewhere and alone. Hasn’t she told you all this, as  well? How well she can wear a mask and pull you into a haze of deceit?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The fact that she has appears to be a pretty good argument against her being that convoluted a planner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  natural,” Olesa said. “She obtains your trust by revealing part of her  nature. She admitted herself that’s she’s completely untrustworthy, but  you trust her, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course not. You really don’t know me very well, do you? I trust her as far as I can throw her, and I know why, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know you well enough to know that you deceive yourself and others quite  wilfully,” Olesa said. “You’re willing to say anything rather than  compromise your image. But your actions show otherwise. You ran in to  save her, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I ran in to spite you. No more, no less.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  say that if you like. I’ll leave it to you to honesty decide what way  your heart lies. But if you trust her, you should wonder why. Why would  she ever sincerely associate with someone like you? Someone she must  regard as sincerely below her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re just acting as if  Momomi’s just like you, but she’s different. More so than you could  believe.” Kaname set to work on the landing walls. Olesa was vaguely  annoying, but amusing to listen to. <em>It’s all so ridiculous… trust? I’m Kaname Kenjou. I haven’t made that stupid mistake in years…</em> “She appreciates my achievements. She can see further than you bastards.” Even so, she took pride in saying that. <em>Well, it’s to be expected. Even I need a little outside validation, but I’m not making a habit of it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course,” Olesa said. “She would flatter you. A lot, I suspect.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah. And she’s manipulating me with every thought, word, blush and  breath she ever utters. I don’t ascribe her with that level of  omniscience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All the same, you’ll come to think stupid things  around her,” Olesa said. “Stuff like you’re alike, kindred spirits,  working together. That out of everyone in this school she spurns,  you’re somehow different. That you know she’s different from everyone  in this school you spurn. That you feel good around her, even if you’re  arguing, and that she understands you on some level. That she cares for  you in little ways, and you her. That you’ll protect her. You can’t  feel these things and still say you’re safe and alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think anything stupid like that. She’s an enemy worth fighting, no more and no less.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  can say that for a thousand years, if you like. But your heart must  know the intrinsic truth. She’s got closer to you than you’ve allowed  anyone to go for years, and you don’t know how she did it. I wouldn’t  be too surprised if you laid bare your own soul, and no doubt she was  there to listen and comfort you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know about me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing  but guesses,” Olesa replied. “Make of my words what you will. But be  more honest with yourself than you are with me. Those things certainly  don’t fool her. She knows the power she has over you and how to use it  to a nicety, I can assure you of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even if I felt such  things, which I don’t, there’s no need for her to use them,” Kaname  said. “I’m doing everything she needs right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right now, for  now. In future, she’ll go far further. Someone like her can’t be happy  on the fringes of the school’s life.” Olesa shrugged. “It might not be  a bad thing. But she’ll move inwards and she’ll use you if she can.  Surrounded by people who you have to humour, abusing your talents  pointlessly to impress, limiting your behaviour to what’s acceptable,  not what you want to do… those are all things that come with the social  integration you run from. Most important comes the possibility of  involvement. Which means hurt, betrayal and suffering.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not as fragile as that. I’m not afraid of a couple of bratty teenagers. And you’re wrong. Momomi wouldn’t do anything-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? What wouldn’t she do? You know Momomi better than anyone. What are her inhibitions?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s not a bad person,” Kaname said lamely. “She’s not like me, or you, or Amiki. She’s definitely different!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what she’d definitely want you to say. But does that sweet sincerity really sound like you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know what I know. I’m not weak enough to fall over myself because of your words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  be careful of where the future will take you, with her,” Olesa said.  “Even if you’re right, Kiyashiki won’t remain static forever. She won’t  be the girl you know and can be comfortable with in the confines of  your room. She’ll be walking out into the light and she’ll expect you  to follow. Can you do that? Can you do anything but hold her back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not afraid of things like that,” Kaname muttered. “Sorry if you find that disappointing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  she won’t be yours, either,” Olesa said. “Now you can call her yours  and yours alone but she’s already making other acquaintances, which  will become friends, regardless of the circumstances of their meeting.  The Etoiles, Tomori, even Amiki and I… she’ll spare words for all of  us, joke with us and converse with us in a way you thought was  specially reserved for you. As she rises, she won’t be at your level  any more. That doesn’t mean you won’t be used for as long as you’re  useful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can keep up with her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really? Then why are  you working for her and her alone, as a tool? You don’t have an agenda  of your own. You just follow her lead. That’s not a relationship of  equals. You’re just like Amiki.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed sarcastically. “Don’t compare me to that lackey of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A useful sidekick who can do the physical work,” Olesa said. “Of course, you can coach her on her tests too. Aren’t you lucky?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can stop whenever I like.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you? Until you do, she’ll have you where she wants you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Again, I’m not mislead that easily.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa  shrugged again. “Say what you like. These are just warnings. But she’ll  definitely try and drag you closer. She’ll smile and act friendly and  sweet, she’ll hold you and listen to you and confide in you and comfort  you… but those things aren’t reserved for you. You aren’t special,  Kenjou. You’re the closest target, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t know her at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you do. Wouldn’t she prefer to have others to cover her back? How about Otori? Wouldn’t she do better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This isn’t a job application process,” Kaname said, fists clenching at the mere mention of Amane. “It isn’t like that at all!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  is it, then? Friendship? I thought you didn’t do friends, Kenjou, but  Kiyashiki probably likes the word. Be careful what she does with it.  You’d do well to remember who she is before you trust her smile again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re shameless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  remember who you are, too.” Olesa turned away. “Can you stand to be  second to her? Can you accept a place amongst however many others? Do  you want everything or nothing? What do you want from Momomi Kiyashiki?  If you can’t tell me that, I don’t know why you’re helping her at all.  Well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve no need to tell you,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then ask yourself what she wants and what you want. Don’t come crying to me when they don’t match.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname watched her walk up the clock tower stairs without stopping her. <em>Ludicrous…  such a ludicrous girl. But. But. It doesn’t matter. Right? We’re just  enemies, we both accept that. We won’t get closer to each other. Never  again. I won’t let myself be betrayed ever again. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Why  does an enemy have such a sweet smile, and a perfect mask I can’t  pierce? It’s so beautiful I sometimes wonder whether I want to let  myself be betrayed. But, I can trust her.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I think.</em></span></p>
