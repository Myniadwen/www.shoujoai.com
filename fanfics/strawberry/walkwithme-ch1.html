<h1>Walk With Me</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../strawberry/index.html">Strawberry Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/starofheaven.html">Star of Heaven</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Today was the first nice day of spring.  She was also graduating 
soon.  So maybe it was only natural that Shizuma wanted to spend some 
time with Nagisa this Sunday.  It was possibly because of that Tamao&#39;s 
dorm room felt so empty right now.

	Tamao understood quite clearly that Shizuma and Nagisa were a 
couple now and that couples spent lots of time together.  But that 
didn&#39;t mean Shizuma had to hog Nagisa all for herself all the time.  
&quot;You&#39;ll see more of Nagisa once I graduate.  But you mustn&#39;t lay a hand 
on her.  I&#39;ll still be around,&quot; was what Shizuma had actually said to 
Tamao before she and Nagisa had left for their date.  Letting out a sign 
of frustration, Tamao let herself fall back onto her bed.

	Now, Tamao absolutely did not have any plans to steal Nagisa away 
from Shizuma.  Still, as Nagisa&#39;s best friend, Tamao felt it was her 
duty to watch over Nagisa.

	&quot;I&#39;m all done cleaning!&quot; Chiyo said cheerfully as she clutched the 
broom handle close to her chest.

	Tamao smiled, almost wickedly.  She didn&#39;t have to do this alone.  
&quot;Hey, Chiyo-chan...&quot; she began.

					*	*	*
	It was quite a beautiful day.  Everything above was blue with not 
even the slightest hint of gray, and the trees were just beginning to 
have that fresh green color.  Yes, Shizuma thought, it was a wonderful 
day to do a little shopping, eat some ice cream cones, and, at this 
present moment, walk through a park, all while holding hands with the 
one she loved.

	Shizuma took another bite of her ice cream cone as she glanced at 
Nagisa.  Small, golden stars dangled from Nagisa&#39;s earlobes.  When 
Shizuma had first seen those earrings, she had known that they would 
look so cute on Nagisa.  To check if Nagisa had pierced ears, Shizuma 
had to lean in very close, and she had done that in the middle of a 
crowd.  Nagisa was so cute when she was embarrassed, Shizuma had 
noticed.

	The park Shizuma and Nagisa were walking through was beautiful, 
but there weren&#39;t a whole lot of people around.  So far, they had only 
seen women and girls.  The real world didn&#39;t seem much different from 
school, Shizuma noticed.  And in a week, she would graduate and head 
into this &quot;real world.&quot;

	&quot;Shizuma-chan, are you all right?&quot; Nagisa asked, her cute voice 
bringing Shizuma back into reality.  &quot;You look kind of spaced out.&quot;

	Shizuma nodded.  &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she answered with a smile.  &quot;I was 
just thinking about graduation.  I&#39;m really going to miss Miator.&quot;

	&quot;But you&#39;ll visit often, right?&quot; Nagisa assumed, wrapping her arms 
around Shizuma&#39;s back while being careful with her ice cream cone.

	&quot;Of course,&quot; Shizuma assured, returning Nagisa&#39;s hug and lightly 
kissing the redhead&#39;s lips.  &quot;There&#39;s no way I could ever leave you.&quot;

	Nagisa smiled broadly and gave Shizuma a kiss of her own.  Shizuma 
felt happier; Nagisa was becoming more and more outgoing.  Shizuma 
wanted to do more than just hug and kiss, but she would wait for Nagisa 
to do the initializing.  She would know then that Nagisa truly wanted to 
go all the way and then it would result in something beautiful.  But 
until then, Shizuma would do her best not to pressure Nagisa.

	When they finished their ice cream cones, they realized their legs 
were growing tired from all this walking.  They decided to rest on a 
bench near the playground.  Right now, only a few little girls played 
while their mothers watched.  Nagisa and Shizuma heard loud movement in 
some bushes behind them, but they figured it was only a few overexcited 
squirrels.

	&quot;We should go to the beach next,&quot; Shizuma suggested, slipping her 
hand into Nagisa&#39;s.

	&quot;But I don&#39;t have my swimsuit with me!&quot; Nagisa pointed out, her 
voice filled with more worry than what was necessary.  Nagisa was still 
a bit nervous around her, Shizuma noticed.

	Nevertheless, Shizuma still chuckled.  &quot;Nagisa, you&#39;re so cute.  
We don&#39;t need our swimsuits.  Just our bare feet.&quot;

	&quot;Oh.&quot;  Nagisa&#39;s face was once again that adorable shade of red.  
&quot;Well then, I&#39;d love to go to the beach with you,&quot; she said, her smile 
sincere, but still slightly awkward.

	Shizuma also smiled and lightly kissed Nagisa&#39;s cheek.  They then 
stood up and began walking again, hand-in-hand.

	Once Shizuma and Nagisa were out of sight, Tamao and Chiyo stood 
up from behind the bushes.  &quot;The beach, huh?&quot; Tamao said, crossing her 
arms over her chest.  &quot;Clich&#130;, but still romantic.&quot;

	&quot;Tamao-oneesama, why do we have to follow Nagisa-oneesama and 
Hanazono-sama?&quot; Chiyo asked.  &quot;They&#39;re in love.  Can&#39;t we give them a 
little privacy?&quot;

	&quot;True, they are in love,&quot; Tamao agreed, nodding her head.  &quot;I know 
she&#39;s chosen someone else, but she&#39;s still my best friend.  It&#39;s my job 
to ensure that Nagisa-chan is being treated right!&quot;

	Chiyo blushed slightly, but she was smiling broadly.  &quot;Yeah, 
Nagisa-oneesama does deserve the very best!&quot;

	Tamao gripped Chiyo&#39;s hand.  &quot;Let&#39;s go, Chiyo-chan!  Nagisa-chan 
is counting on us!&quot;

	Chiyo nodded enthusiastically and she and Tamao started following 
the same path Nagisa and Shizuma had taken.

					*	*	*
	The waves splashed against the bare feet of Shizuma and Nagisa 
while small particles of sand clung onto the soles.  As Nagisa and 
Shizuma walked along the beach, they had one arm wrapped around the back 
of the other&#39;s waist while they carried their sandals in their other 
hand.

	It was only midday; the sky was still blue.  Nagisa thought orange 
and yellow would be more appropriate for this kind of mood, however 
clich&#130;d that would have been.  She was also reminded of a rumor she had 
once heard; apparently the new Etoile pair, Amane and Hikari, had once 
come to this very beach for a date.

	Etoile.  That title didn&#39;t belong to Shizuma anymore.  Somehow, 
Nagisa felt close to Shizuma because of that.  She was no longer 
elevated to the statues of goddess; she was now a normal human being and 
Nagisa felt more comfortable around her.

	Etoile.  Nagisa still sometimes wondered if she had cost Tamao the 
election.  She had &quot;eloped&quot; with Shizuma, leaving Tamao, the &quot;bride,&quot; 
alone at the altar.  They had a serious discussion later, one that had 
relieved Nagisa of some of her guilt.  She knew Tamao loved her, but 
Tamao accepted her and Shizuma as a couple.  She and Tamao were still 
best friends, so she loved Shizuma without guilt.  Still, sometimes she 
worried about Tamao&#39;s feelings.

	&quot;Nagisa, why do you look so sad?&quot; Shizuma asked as she brought her 
hand from Nagisa&#39;s waist to the redhead&#39;s face.

	&quot;I&#39;m not sad!&quot; Nagisa corrected, her heart pounding.  &quot;I was just 
a little lost in thought.  Hey, let&#39;s go into the water a little!&quot;  With 
her arm still around Shizuma&#39;s waist, Nagisa began walking quickly 
toward the water, almost dragging the older girl with her.  Fortunately, 
Shizuma seemed pleased with Nagisa&#39;s sudden eagerness.

	The water was cold around Nagisa&#39;s ankles, but it still felt 
pleasant.  Even though it was only early spring, the sun would start 
feeling hot to anybody after they had walked around under it for several 
hours, and that included the two girls.  Shizuma stepped into the water 
after Nagisa and then shivered, as if silently agreeing with Nagisa that 
the water was cold.

	&quot;It&#39;s cold, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Nagisa said cheerfully.  &quot;But it feels so 
nice!&quot;

	Shizuma also smiled.  &quot;Yes, it does,&quot; she agreed.  &quot;I quite like 
the water.  It&#39;s where we had our first kiss.&quot;

	Nagisa nodded sharply.  &quot;I remember!  I&#39;ve never held my breath 
for so long.&quot;

	Shizuma chuckled.  &quot;And then I scared you away.  I&#39;m glad you 
forgave me so soon.  I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve done so well in the play 
without your help.&quot;

	&quot;I was just happy to be close to you again.&quot;  After Nagisa said 
that, her smiled weakened.  She placed her hand on Shizuma&#39;s shoulder.  
&quot;When we were in your room, you thought of Kaori-san, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

	&quot;Yes,&quot; Shizuma answered, her voice somber.  &quot;I still hadn&#39;t 
accepted her death and I couldn&#39;t fully love you.  But Kaori didn&#39;t want 
her death to haunt me for the rest of my life.  She wanted me to move 
on, to fall in love again.  If she could see you and me together now, 
she would be very happy.&quot;

	Nagisa&#39;s smiled brightened again and she threw her arms around 
Shizuma.  The older girl returned the younger girl&#39;s embrace, and they 
held each other tightly for a few intense moments.  They then pulled 
away from the other only slightly, and in the blink of an eye, their 
lips were together.  Their kissing was passionate, but they were careful 
not to drop their sandals or fall over into the water.

	When they were done kissing, Shizuma brushed her cheek against 
Nagisa&#39;s and rested her chin on the younger girl&#39;s small shoulder.  &quot;You 
still have that dress I gave you, right?&quot; she whispered into Nagisa&#39;s 
ear, causing the dangling star earring to sway a little.  &quot;We should go 
on a date where that kind of dress would be very appropriate.&quot;

	&quot;That would be nice,&quot; Nagisa replied, her voice also a whisper.

	&quot;Also, Tamao-chan and Chiyo-chan have been following us,&quot; Shizuma 
added, her arms tightening around Nagisa&#39;s body.  &quot;At our wedding, 
Tamao-chan is going to be the one to give you away.  So, let her have 
her fun.&quot;

	&quot;I will,&quot; Nagisa promised.  She felt happy that Tamao cared about 
her so much.  Maybe some other day, soon, she would take Tamao out on a 
casual date.

	Shizuma and Nagisa held each other for a little longer.  Nagisa 
didn&#39;t want this moment to end.  She would be sad when Shizuma 
graduated, but that wouldn&#39;t be the end of their relationship.  They 
still had a lot planned for their future together.

	When the hug ended, Nagisa and Shizuma saw Tamao and Chiyo waiting 
for them.  &quot;Tamao-chan, Chiyo-chan!&quot; Nagisa exclaimed as she began 
rushing toward them while Shizuma followed calmly.
