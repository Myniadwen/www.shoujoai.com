<p><em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">She looks a little melancholy. </span></em>Kaname sighed and leaned forwards slightly, picking up another mouthful of rice. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Well,  I guess that’s to be expected, after that little encounter. Somehow I  knew that would happen, but it still didn’t end very well, for all  that. It’s…annoying. I should have been able to do more than I did. I’m  not sure how, not exactly, but I should have done more. Perhaps I  shouldn’t have told her to go over… no, it wasn’t something she could  run away from, I think. It was important to her sister, at least. She  deserved to know what was going on, and whose fault it was- as if she  couldn’t guess anyway. But was that really my decision to make? I mean,  what do I know about family affairs? It felt like the right thing to do  at the time, but- I don’t know. I didn’t really think things through,  just as usual, and it ended up like this. Well, it could have been  worse. He could have hit me. Actually, that may even have been better.  If he’d hit me, she’d be able to hate him a lot more. Hate’s a lot  easier to deal with than the struggle to understand someone. I should  know, because it’s a lesson Momomi taught me. After that, too, I  suppose I was cold. But it’s not like I was unaffected either. Momomi  is the perfect one, or at least she should be. Even though this is one  of the ways I was first able to relate to her, she deserves better than  this. Why can’t she have a perfect family? Sure, she has Luigia. But  she also has him. If even the super-elite suffer like this, it’s a  pretty damning indictment of humanity in general. Or is it a good  thing, because rich and poor alike are all human?</span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re looking thoughtful,” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ah.” Kaname shrugged. “Well, I was thinking about something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Anything in particular?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Liar,”  Momomi said, without rancour. She grabbed a piece of pork with her  chopsticks and ate it swiftly. “But you know… I still don’t get him.”  Momomi sighed. “Who the hell is my father? I find it harder to hate him  now simply because I couldn’t even begin to tell you who he is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Read my mind, is it? </em>“Hating people is easier,” Kaname remarked. “I’d do that if I was you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  know that, but it’s also something that’s hard to force.” Momomi sighed  again, picking at her food. “I hate the man I know as my father, but I  get this sense I don’t know all of him now. And I’m not sure whether I  hate that man or pity him… and I’m not even sure whether he was real.  Perhaps I had a bad dream.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, you’re here. It pains me to  admit it, but that’s because of him, not us, in the end.” Kaname  snorted. “That is something I hate. I wish I wasn’t so powerless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  told you before,” Momomi said, smiling weakly. “Well, sort of. But I’ll  say it again now. You don’t have to force yourself to protect me. It’s  enough that I’m with you, because you mean a lot to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A purpose?” Kaname replied. “Isn’t that what you said?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  nodded. “That, and other things too. But you’re right. He did let me  stay here, even if he dresses it up as banishment. Is it banishment?  I’m sure he’d disown me if it wasn’t for the fact that he then wouldn’t  be able to sell me later…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“There’s no point in caring either way, is there? You got what you wanted, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah.”  Momomi nodded. “In that respect, I’m fine. But I still can’t stop  myself from thinking about it. Was it benevolence? Cruelty?  Indifference? Calculation? Intentions mean almost as much as actions…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What’s done is done, isn’t it? A result is a result, no matter your attentions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“From the perspective of judging a situation, that’s right,” Momomi agreed. “But judging people is more complicated.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s probably impossible to deal with real accuracy,” Kaname warned. “I wouldn’t even try, if I were you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I think… we have to try, precisely because not many people, and because it’s difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smiled. “Philosophy over lunch, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi pouted. “Well, the morning is already off-limits. We have to talk like this at some point, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But  even then… it’s hard. He’s my father.” Momomi grimaced. “I’ve hated him  for all my life, but it looks like I’ve always been uncomfortable about  doing so, because the moment I have the chance not to I’m on a complete  guilt trip about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“He’s the one who should be guilty.  Hopefully, he is guilty, but I’m not sure he’s the kind of person who  can be redeemed. Either way, he’s a horrible person.” Kaname shrugged.  “Even if you ask me too, I’m not going to apologise for that. He treats  you all like crap.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know. I know that. And it would be a  betrayal of Luigia, Yukaho and Araldo if I forgave him on some level.  And of myself. He deserves to be hated and I need to hate him. More  than that, I know I do hate him.” Momomi picked up another piece of  pork and ate it, chewing and swallowing before she spoke again. “But  doesn’t everyone want to have parents they can love? It’s more wish  fantasy… for me and you, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know the feeling.” Kaname  sipped her coke. “I don’t think there are many people who actually want  to hate their parents. Well, stupid teenagers on a rebellion. But for  people like us- well, if we hate our parents, they’re still our  parents, and we have to live with them. Because children are powerless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And  if we hate them they’ve probably done something to deserve it,” Momomi  agreed. “But that’s just pragmatism. More than that, for me… I’d like  to be able to be proud of where I’m from. But I can’t. I hate that as  well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That makes two of us, again.” Kaname laughed shortly. “Quite a pair, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  nodded again, smiling slightly. “We really are. But when other people  can talk about home, that’s not really something I can say so easily…  or you, I guess. It’s hard to remember where you’re going when you’re  busy trying to forget where you came from.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because I’m such an  optimistic girl, I prefer to view things in a more positive light,”  Kaname reflected. “As we have no lingering past, we’re free to invent  out future without any inhibitions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Isn’t that a little scary, though? Especially for thirteen year-olds.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  started two years ago. You started now.” Kaname closed her eyes. “Well,  immature or not, you almost getting yourself kidnapped was almost the  same thing. It can be done. I’ve always believed in myself in that  respect, and I know you’re the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m not sure I could do it alone,” Momomi said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  you’ll always have people to support you,” Kaname said, waving her free  hand dismissively. “I’m sure of that. You’re the kind of person who can  win people over, when you really try.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi half-nodded, sighing again. “If you say so, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So  what’s the whole situation with the Etoiles, anyway?” Kaname asked,  hoping to redirect the conversation. “I don’t really understand that at  all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi made a face at her tuna and ate some rice instead.  “Damn Japanese good manners… but, for that, I’m not sure myself.  Father’s not pushing for now, but he’s not dropping matters either. He  may be hoping to press things later, or he’s given up on the whole  thing without bothering to tell Serané’s parents.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s be good for the Etoiles, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly.  That’s why I’m almost sure that can’t be it.” Momomi looked depressed  again. “He’s not the kind of person who’d be that subtle or… well,  nice. So maybe he really does hope that Serané will come round given  enough time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It doesn’t settle matters, though, does it?” Kaname said. “Either way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded. “It doesn’t settle matters. And until Serané puts her foot down with her parents, it won’t be settled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I wish she’d just do that and be done with it. I don’t exactly like Kariya, but she deserves better than this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  not even sure she could,” Momomi replied. “It’s as you said, children  are pretty powerless in this world. Perhaps she’s hoping to stall until  she’s of age and with relative freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sounds like a good excuse for inactivity,” Kaname snorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  we’re no different, right?” Momomi shrugged. “I mean, I told my parents  everything, pretty clearly. Yukaho appears to have selectively blocked  her memory and Rodrigo’s decided the… problem will go away if he  ignores it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well… you’re certain, aren’t you? You’ve always been certain about it, and to his face.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of  course I’m certain.” Momomi rolled her eyes. “It’s a fundamental thing,  isn’t it? You dream about girls, or you dream about girls… I mean,  boys. Freudian slip.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname chuckled. “I see. Well, it’s not always that simple, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The  people who don’t dream, or dream of both, or mostly boys but with one  girl, or something like that.” Kaname blushed slightly. “Well, I’m no  good with this stuff, but you know what I mean. A lot of people are far  more confused than you or I, and that’s a human thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  suppose so, if you’re being serious.” Momomi scowled. “But that kind of  thing is why I hate the attitude my parents have. I’m only able to be  so comfortable with myself because I go to school at Astraea. If I was  still with my parents, I’d probably be in denial and seriously screwed  up in the head.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Welcome to a modern age. But that leaves us with one heck of a generation gap.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  wish it was simply a generation gap,” Momomi said. “People like my  sister and Araldo think the same things, and plenty of people are  worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I suppose so.” Kaname frowned. “I’d probably be the same myself, if I’d gone to the kind of school I was supposed to go to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The  worst thing is that I can’t just say it’s bad people. I mean, for every  person like my father, there’s someone like my sister. That’s what  upsets me the most.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, your sister supports you, doesn’t she? In a strange sort of way…” Kaname shrugged. “You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Momomi  on gay rights issues…almost as cheery as Momomi on her father. I guess  I’ll try and think of something else to talk about. </em>Kaname frowned, considering her options.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Open wide.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What?” Kaname focused again to find a piece of tuna not very far from her mouth. “What are you doing now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I won the bet, so it’s my command.” Momomi smiled sweetly. “Let me feed you. That’s an order.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed theatrically. “This can’t be hygienic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh,  come on,” Momomi teased, cocking her head. “It’s no more dangerous than  kissing someone, and no one says that’s unhygienic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“When you put it like that-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s a metaphor. A metaphor! You won’t catch the cooties or whatever like this, so hurry up. My arm’s getting sore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  rolled her eyes and leaned forwards, grabbing the tuna and sliding back  to chew. “You know, I don’t know why you enjoy this game so much,” she  said, as Momomi held up another piece. “It’s not like we haven’t done  it before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Kaname is just too cute when I’m feeding her,” Momomi replied. “Like an overgrown child. It’s a lot of fun to watch.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, great. What next? You gonna put me in a zoo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think so. I’m not into kinky stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>We’re getting strange looks. Oh, well. It’s not like I care that much. </em>Kaname accepted another piece. “One day I’ll understand all this stuff you’re mumbling about. That’ll be a dark day for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, reaching puberty isn’t all that bad…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ve reached puberty, damnit! Shouldn’t you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi fluttered her eyelashes. “Should I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not like that,” Kaname managed, gritting her teeth. “You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Refresh my memory.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“At lunchtime? Forget it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright.”  Momomi just smiled. “You’re way too easy to tease, Kaname. It’s another  of your points that makes you cute, and, somehow, innocent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Innocent.” Kaname rolled her eyes. “That’s definitely the last word I’d use to describe myself…” <em>I  should be arguing more than this, shouldn’t I? I should definitely be  arguing more than this. I should be angry. But when she’s smiling like  that and speaking like that, I find it hard to be angry. She’s the cute  one, and it’s bloody annoying sometimes.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Actually, you do  have an innocent streak. It’s damn well hidden, but you can be naïve at  times, Kaname.” Momomi offered her another piece.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname leaned forwards again, sighing and feeling slightly stupid. “I’m not naïve! Now that makes even less sense…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It  was intended as a compliment, I think it’s another of your good  features.” Momomi smiled at her. “Even you don’t have to rush into  being an adult, Kaname. You can grow up at your own pace, because we’ll  be at Astraea for years anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I can look after myself,” Kaname protested. “I’ve already proved that. I’m more mature than you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Quite  possibly,” Momomi agreed. “But like I said, it’s not a bad thing.  There’s one thing I’m old fashioned on, and that’s the fact that  children should be allowed to be children.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So what? No sex  before marriage and a whole load of enforced misconceptions about  childhood innocence?” Kaname growled. “I thought we both agreed that  something like that was a sham.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. What I mean about  children being children is that they should be allowed to choose their  own pace. They don’t have to grow up, but if they want to, they can.  And either way, they’re going to make mistakes. Don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Speak for yourself,” Kaname replied. “Have you made mistakes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Of course. Quite a few. But I try harder, and that’s enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I can’t say I’m a person who has too many regrets,” Kaname said. “It’s pointless living that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not even about our row?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, fine. I have a few. But not many, that’s what I said.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  giggled. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes, and I’ll keep on making them for  the indeterminate future. Let’s both just try our best, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You cheered up revoltingly fast,” Kaname observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi nodded, feeding her the last piece of tuna. “Your company does that to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What, I make you act like you’re stoned?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“This is why Shion’s too much. You’re always cutting to everyone, with such a callous carelessness.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname smiled. “Are you sure it’s not just you and Shion who get treated like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How  very cruel.” Momomi sighed theatrically. “Well, at least you don’t beat  me up or pretend I don’t exist. That’ll have to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  making yourself sound as innocent as ever,” Kaname observed. “I like to  think you’re innocent, and I generally manage right up until you start  insinuating this and that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, everyone has their flaws,”  Momomi observed, eating a pickle philosophically. “Even Serané, a  picture-portrait of innocence in all its fluttering, wide-eyed glory,  can be very calculating when she has to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Her? She acts  innocent, but I really doubt that. I mean… sexually innocent? Like  hell. Emotionally? She’s all too shrewd. Mentally? She’s all too  sharp.” Kaname shrugged. “It’s just her act, alongside Kariya. I’ve got  used to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You make her sound so cold.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s the way it is. You’re not the type to be fooled.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I guess not.” Momomi ate another pickle. “It would be nice to be fooled, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Perhaps.  But I’ve never been able to believe in that stuff.” Kaname made to pick  up a mushroom from her salad, but Momomi gave her a pointed look.  “What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Now you feed me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Do I have to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Embarrassed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“More like I quite like my salad,” Kaname said. “Can’t you have my pickles instead? I don’t like those.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Alright. Half of each.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rolled her eyes. “Why do always make things so complicated?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Because things are more fun that way.” Momomi stuck her tongue out. “Don’t give me that look. I know you enjoy it really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yeah,  right…” Kaname said. But she picked up one of her tsukemono and fed it  to her friend anyway. There was umeboshi there amongst other things, so  it almost worked out in her favour anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>And it’s not like I mind. It’s a little…fun, though I’d be loath to admit that. I just wish I knew why. </em>Kaname frowned slightly, selecting umeboshi next. <em>Well,  it’s not like I’m stupid or anything. I know this sort of thing could  be construed as flirtatious. In fact, I also know that the people in  this restaurant right now are construing it as exactly that. But it’s  not like I care; it’s just a game we play. Screwing around with manners  and supposed proprietary, based on my one faux pas all that time ago.  Somehow I get a sense that we would have done this anyway, though. It’s  something that suits Momomi I suppose, the supposed older sister  looking after me who actually quite likes to be a spoilt child herself.  She’s bipolar like that. </em>Kaname moved the fruit close to Momomi’s  lips, then pulled it back slightly, watching in amusement as Momomi  gave her an annoyed look. <em>I suppose she’s right. It’s okay to be a  child, or an adult, or anything we want. And it’s okay to act like  this, because we’re friends. Then there’s… earlier. She keeps holding  my hand. And I keep letting her. I was forced to the admission, it’s  even a little enjoyable, though again I’d suffer from a thousand years  of pain before I said as much out loud. I wonder why? I suppose that’s  something between friends again, it’s not like I know much about  friendship. Sure, couples hold hands, but couples hug each other as  well, and girls hug each other all time. Even straight girls.  Allegedly, anyway, all the teenage girls I knew before were more likely  to stab me, and the new bunch appears more likely to molest me. But  it’s not like we’re kissing or anything, so it’s fine. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I never knew feeding me required so much concentration,” Momomi teased. “I suppose it shows your devotion to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname glanced at her warily. <em>And I suppose I could do with less comments like that. </em>“You’ve become a right little Amiki, haven’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“The teasing? Oh, that’s nothing to do with her. Unlike her, I’m usually serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Nice to know,” Kaname replied dryly, for the lack of a better reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, if you don’t like it, then tell me. I’d stop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well…”  Kaname considered this, momentarily disarmed. “I guess it’s not that I  hate it or anything… it just takes me by surprise from to time…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  thought as much.” Momomi grinned. “Well, that works the other way as  well. I intend to do and say as much as I can before you explicitly  tell me to stop. So beware. Silence is a form of consent!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Does that mean even more teasing?” Kaname shook her head. “I shouldn’t have encouraged you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You hardly encouraged me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “That’s the closest I ever get to enthusiasm, and you know it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  suppose so, but even so, your oh-so-cool attitude can get annoying.  Sometimes it’s nice to admit you enjoy something, isn’t it?” Momomi  pouted. “Your way’s pretty dishonest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“It’s not a matter of dishonesty. I just don’t like to overstate things. Besides, you’re the same.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I wouldn’t change in me or you,” Momomi said. “I’m sure it’s part of our charm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re very playful today,” Kaname remarked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  that’s to be expected, isn’t it?” Momomi smiled. “This is my special  celebration of the fact that I can stay with you, so I should be  enjoying it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3"><em>Playful? Flirty is closer to the mark…</em>Kaname tried to push that thought to the back of her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">They  finished lunch eventually, Momomi paying again and tipping more  generously this time. It appeared that she’d cheered up, though it was  a shame that went hand in hand with what Kaname considered to be a  considerable waste of money. A lot more shopping followed, buying  everything Momomi had promised and then some. After that, a rather  laden Kaname followed a rather less encumbered Momomi into the  bookstore. She’d had to carry most of the bags, of course.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How  are you planning to explain all this to the sisters when we get back?”  Kaname demanded. “It can’t be Catholic to have this many possessions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Don’t  you remember?” Momomi quipped, looking around for the romance section.  “The odds a rich man has on getting into heaven are identical to those  of a camel trying to walk through the head of a pin, or something like  that. So obviously it’s Christian to convert all my dangerous, sinful  money into possessions. I’m saving my immortal soul, so they can’t  disapprove, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I like your logic,” Kaname replied. “I just get this sense that they won’t be so keen on it. Perhaps that’s just me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  we’ll think of something. Even if we just go running and crying to the  Etoiles for their backup. They were the ones who suggested this trip,  anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t remember them suggesting we should buy up half the town’s clothes stores.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then  we’ll just have to split them up, and say to Serané that Kariya  suggested it, and say to Kariya that Serané suggested it. Hopefully  that’ll hold up for long enough.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, as long as you have a  plan,” Kaname remarked, sounding amused. They finally reached the  section Momomi was looking for, so she dropped the bags with relief.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We make a lot of plans. Not many of them come to anything, truthfully, but at least it keeps us busy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know the feeling,” Kaname agreed. “I suppose it made us feel better, or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How’s kendo?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So-so.  I’m still waiting, with some dread, for my first proper meet including  Kariya. She’s going to rip me to shreds, and there’s not much I can do  about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, that’s just her way,” Momomi said. “I’m sure you’ll pick it up fast enough, you have a knack for these things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Definitely. How about you? Done any of the script yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not  exactly. I’ve had other things to worry about.” Momomi shrugged.  “Hopefully Olesa’s made a start, otherwise we’ll just have to rush it  at the last minute.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “And I thought you said we should have a good work ethic from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’m  working up to it, you know. First I’ll get the work done on time and  then I can concentrate on getting it done on time any time before the  night before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname rolled her eyes, something she knew she was  doing more and more often. “That’s a good excuse. I’ll bear that in  mind for the future… sorry, your honour, but I’m gradually cutting down  on my violence, so I aimed not to kill him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked over her shoulder and smiled at her friend. “That metaphor doesn’t quite follow, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Sounds fine to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you’d done something that stupid to throw away your life, I wouldn’t let you live to see a jury.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“So because I’d wasted my life you’d kill me?” Kaname said. “Your logic’s as interesting as ever…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, mostly it’d be to gratify my own feelings,” Momomi said lightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Okay, now I’m scared. Remind me never to commit violent crime in your presence.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Without my permission.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Without your permission?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, sometimes I’ll need you to protect me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname prodded her friend on the shoulder. “I don’t count that. I’ll do that with or without your permission, as I please.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ever the Prince Charming.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Ha. I’m more violent and dangerous than that poof ever was.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  browsed the shelves, occasionally pulling a book off the shelves and  reading the blurb. Motivated by boredom, Kaname looked round herself,  checking one book with a particularly odious cover and grimacing. “Seen  anything good?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A couple. You have to pick carefully, because a lot of them are rubbish.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I can see that. Well, I suppose that goes for any genre.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly. I go by three rules myself. No pink. No ditz leads. No vampires.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname raised her eyebrows. “No vampires? Is that usually a problem?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Not often, but still… just don’t get me started on the vampires.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname tried not to laugh. “No vampires. Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“What kind of books do you like? Do you want to get anything?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname stiffened. “I’m not going to accept more gifts from you-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  won the bet. My new order is find three books you want, as they have a  three-for-two offer on most things.” Momomi turned and gave her an  affectionate look. “Consider it rent for the things I’ve put you  through so far, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it hasn’t been too bad, so it’s not like you owe me anything,” Kaname began.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Oh, don’t be too stiff. Besides, I’m not finished yet. I’m sure you’ll hate me by the end of the day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If that was going to happen, it would have happened already,” Kaname remarked, going to look at the horror section.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi followed her with amusement. “Looks like we have some pretty significant differences as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Sometimes there’s romance. It’s just that people tend to die, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“About as true to life as my books, too. You know, I must know boring people, but no-one I know has <em>ever</em> been stalked by a crazed killer with an axe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Yes, yes. I take your point. I suppose we’ll just have to keep a truce on the subject of our reading tastes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“A truce right now?” Momomi said. “I owe you about ten minutes worth of cynicism!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You bear grudges, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That was earlier today, you know. Of course I remember.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname sighed. “Perhaps I should be the one to bribe you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Bribe me by taking your orders quietly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  looked through the shelves, trying to narrow down her potential choices  to three. That was the hard part, once she’d got past her pride.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But aren’t you a bit young to be reading that kind of book?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I don’t think so.” Kaname shrugged. “It’s not like I’m afraid of the dark or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re just fearless. I always get uneasy reading that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  you always call me reckless. Isn’t that the same?” Kaname shrugged. “In  any case, I read a load of these books when I first got to Astraea, and  then got bored of them. Reading’s a useful hobby in that it lets you  exclude and avoid socializing with a veneer of legitimacy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  make it sound like such a terrible thing,” Momomi noted, walking across  to her with books in hand. “But you do have a point. I suppose I used  them to pull off the same trick when I was at home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“They make  you feel like you choose to be alone, rather than merely being alone.”  Kaname shrugged. “People like us would use that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“We’re hardly the only ones.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  of course. Shion’s another example. Olesa and Amiki, too, though they  appear to be inseparable themselves. Devices to make loneliness less  arduous… half the time, they’re called hobbies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi giggled. “Whatever happened to the social dimension of that kind of thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Some  hobbies do. A lot more pretend they do. But don’t consider that a  criticism of them, I don’t believe in the necessity of socialization  myself.” Kaname shrugged. “There aren’t many people in this world worth  knowing. Even if I don’t know anyone, I can still live in a moderately  satisfactory way. In some ways, it’s more convenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I know what you mean. Well, I act the same way. But it sounds pretty cold when you say it like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it is pretty cold. But I’m a fairly cold person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t know… you never seemed that way to me.” Momomi browsed the  shelves, but Kaname had a feeling that was just a pretext to avoid eye  contact. “You always pushed me away, as hard as you could, of course.  But somehow, it felt you were dragging me in just as much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Certainly,  if driving you away was my only aim, I would have done a better job of  it, with hindsight.” Kaname shrugged. “I’m not completely asocial, and  you’re someone who’s interesting. Someone not unlike me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“One of the few people in this world worth knowing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“If you insist, yes. But aren’t I the same thing to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi  giggled. “Somewhat. Not that I planned it or anything. On the contrary,  I’d intended not to make any friends at all… I really messed up,  basically.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m glad you did. Even if I say it’s easy to live alone… it does get kinda boring after a while.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And pointless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“And pointless, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“But I was meaning to ask you…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi looked at her briefly. “What do you make of relationships at our age?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname flicked through the pages of a horror novel. <em>Probably as a pretext to avoid eye contact…</em>”You mean, romantic relationships?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi turned away again. “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I  don’t see why not. It’ll probably end horribly, things like that tend  to at our age… but who cares about that? It’s better to start screwing  up early, so you can get better, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi made a face.  “I can tell that it’s not something you’ve considered relevant to you  by the way you can say that so casually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, yeah. But like I said before, what are the odds of it ever being an issue for me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re  not immune to Astraea’s considerations, you know,” Momomi pointed out.  “Quite the opposite, surely someone like you will attract interest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, it’s not like I’m interested. Most of that school could disappear overnight without me losing any sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“That’s a very Kaname answer…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Why do you ask, anyway? Worried about whether you should go for your mysterious cute girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname snorted. “And you won’t tell me who she is? You’re killing me slowly here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“I’ll get around to eventually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname opened her mouth, then closed it again. <em>Am  I the one? That’s a simple and important question…but I can’t ask it.  If I’m wrong, I’d look stupid and arrogant. If I’m right, well… I don’t  actually know what I’d say if I was right. So I shouldn’t just throw  out stupid guesses. Might as easily be Amiki or Shion or anyone. Though  somehow neither of those would work. </em>“Well, is it annoying you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Somewhat. I’ve been thinking about it a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then I’d just stuff it and go for it. At the very least, that’ll be a learning experience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You  say that very easily, again,” Momomi noted. “But it’s not an easy thing  to even attempt… and I don’t want to contemplate the possibility of  rejection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well, I’m not the best person to talk to this about,” Kaname said. “Wouldn’t Serané or someone be better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re the person I trust the most.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  scratched her head. “Well, look at it this way. I don’t know anything  about this stuff, so my advice won’t be any good. If you just want it  as reassurance to back up a decision that’s already made, there’s no  point. You should work out what that decision is and act on it. Even if  you ask me, it’s not my business. You have to decide this yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“You’re right,” Momomi said. “I have to take responsibility for myself, as well. So I need to think like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Exactly,” Kaname said, relieved. “If you can’t even tell me who it is, then it’s better off that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“How about you? If it was your decision to make in my decision?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname  scratched her cheek. “Well, I’ve said it before and you always say I’m  too casual… but I’d charge ahead. Not out of particular courage. That’s  just how I deal with things, I’m not a subtle person. And I hate it  when I angst.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi smiled. “You would, wouldn’t you… that’s very much like you, again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname held up three books. “This, this and this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Then let’s go,” Momomi said. “It looks like we’ll both have a lot to read, if nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">“Well,  that is what happens when you go to a bookstore…” Kaname followed her  towards the counter. “Well, is that everything for today?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi cocked her head, considering. “Well, I’d like to go to the cinema.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Kaname checked her watch. “It’s too late. We need to get back to school with all this stuff, and then it will be curfew.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext3">Momomi gave her an innocent look. “So?”</span></p>
