<p><em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I see…yes,  it might not be mature, but it is human, to react like this. Even you  are human, Olesa, though you’re a little robotic at times. You like to  pretend that you’re beyond mere human feelings. But that’s all a lie,  now isn’t it, Olesa? You hate me and envy me and fear me, mostly  because of my father. My blasted father. He never stops troubling me,  one way or the other. He should have died a long time ago, but life  isn’t that convenient.</span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ever since I was a child, I’ve grown used  to it,” Olesa continued, eyes dull. “She said it several times, because  she wanted to explain, she wanted me to understand, she wanted to  excuse herself. And she did more than say it. She could talk for hours  about him, on and on, because she loved him and she has loved him ever  since she had met him. But as a child I knew with the conviction of a  child that he did not love her and I was right, he never did and he  never will do. For him, she was willing to sacrifice herself, and she  lost everything, she even lost the future she wanted to give to her  child. But he never gave her anything. He just took like a parasite. He  played with her feelings because it amused him and he gratified himself  with her body because he enjoyed that and he cast her aside, he left my  mother to discover the real world that is consequences while he carried  on regardless. But she loved him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not love,” Momomi  said. “It’s just a sickly, unnatural obsession, an ego-crushing  self-destructiveness, something that debases the one who loves. It’s a  freakish thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It is all those things. That emotion is called love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  do you know about love? To use that word so freely to make your mother  a victim, that’s pathetic. Love in that sense is just a convenient  excuse for humans to act irrationally, just words, as if it makes  everything better and makes her less of a damn fool.” Momomi gazed  steadily at her rival. “Perhaps I’m coming across as excessively harsh,  but it needs to be said. Your mother destroyed herself and if you want  to call that love, you can. But it’s just idle words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you  would know about love?” Olesa retaliated. “Your family. I know your  family; I made it my business to know your family. Everything began  because of love, but it ended as far from love as possible. I agree  that it’s only been a destructive force for both our families. But if  you think it’s just empty words, a hand-waving justification for those  actions that you take for granted, you are hopelessly naïve.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not what I’m saying. But you can’t call anything our parents did love.” Momomi was relaxed, her shoulders loose. <em>After  all, I’ve been my father’s child all this time. It’s not like I haven’t  thought about these things. Olesa’s the same. We’re saying the things  we’ve kept bottled up in our chests, because there’s never been anyone  who would understand. </em>“Love implies a measure of equality.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  you would not call my mother’s feelings love, because your father did  not return them,” Olesa said. Her voice was controlled now. She looked  like she was attending a debate on some topical issue, global warming  or vivisection or something of the sort. It was a ludicrous expression  under the circumstances. “How is that logical? Anger is anger, whether  the other person is angry or not. Hate is hate, whether the other  person hates or not. Shame is shame, whether the person who shames you  intends that in you. All these things are components of another  one-sided relationship we could both name. They are not false feelings  just because they will never be returned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right, but we  can take that case,” Momomi said. “I’ve never been sure that’s ever  been real anger, real hate. The shame is there, and she’s hostile  enough, but sometimes I think it’s just a smokescreen for something  else. Just because there’s an emotion, that wouldn’t make it love.  That’s what I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if that isn’t love, what is?” Olesa  folded her arms and leaned against the table. “Show me what you think  is love, Phareli-san. What is love?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, trying to  think. “Well, it’s an equal thing, between equals. It’s not any weird  mutual dependence, or anything, it’s not gratifying yourself by  exploiting the other person, or allowing yourself to be exploited  because you enjoy that. That’s all I know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re just applying  your arbitrary rules to a concept, though,” Olesa said. “Those loves  can be very strong and sincere, real emotion. Whether you like it or  not, whether you can accept it or not. My mother loved your father.  Your mother loves your father. Your father doesn’t appear to have  anyone left to love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s just your arbitrary definitions, and your arbitrary judgements.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. But mine is more open-minded than your own. I don’t dismiss things I’m uncomfortable with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re just being inclusive to dignify your mother. It’s nothing more than that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  who never knew, you who never cared, you-” Olesa closed her eyes for a  moment, sighing. “You have no right to pass judgement on my mother,  Phareli-san. It’s extremely ill mannered, and I will not tolerate it,  from you or anyone else. I can judge her, and she loved your father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi fell silent, as much from Amiki’s angry gaze as from Olesa’s words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  people do that,” Olesa said, reigning in her emotions again. “They only  accept the loves that are convenient for them and society. My mother  entered a loveless marriage based on a convenience of business and  family, but she is expected to be faithful. Love with justifies almost  any action before that point is dismissed as nonsense now. A society  which, by and large, applauds a romantic who throws off an arranged  marriage for love- a society which applauds the shirking of  responsibility there- a society which applauds your father- has no time  for the breach of social law that is adultery, even for love. It’s  pathetically schizophrenic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi considered that. “Well,  you’re right. People get overworked about a mere contract, certainly.  Shorn of the religious dimension… something we both seem to scorn,  despite or perhaps because of our upbringings… you’re right, it’s a  nonsense. But you understand we are required to play the game to its  rules, and play the hand we are dealt with. More fool your mother,  because she knew about those social laws. And it still has nothing to  do with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But she never had a fair hand to begin with,” Olesa  said. “She was a woman, and he was a man. You may have noticed how your  father is still unhappily married, but my mother has been, to all  intends and purposes, ruined. That is the fairness and equality of our  society. That is, apparently, justice. A world which transcends mere  national boundaries, a world in which everything is connected, a very  narrow world, a narrow-minded world, determined that for her. It’s a  world open to you and shut to me. And when I look at you who can’t even  bear the moderate price you have to pay to be in that world, I can’t  help but hate you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re welcome to it, my title, my status, my limited means. At least you’re not in chains.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  but I am.” Olesa tapped her fingers on the desk. “My mother is weak,  useless, without any strong personality or discipline, ornamental, a  victim of anyone with will and lost in this world. Everything she was  taught as a child is useless to her now. She has little enough and what  she has she gives to me, and it is more than most people would ever  have but to her it is shockingly inadequate. She is hopeless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Join the club.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I will protect her.” Olesa gave Momomi a challenging look, as if daring  her to laugh. “Unlike you, I will have to have useful talents. I will  have to do what will earn me money, not what I want to do. I will have  to marry who is best suited for my status; not who is best suited for  me. But I chose that for myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why? Is living like a normal person too hard?” Momomi sneered. “Hell, you even keep your servant around.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Merely  paying the school fees leaves us greatly inconvenienced,” Olesa said.  “As for pay, I have nothing to give her. I tell you this because  there’s no time for useless pride any more. But I do these things  because it is not sufficient for my mother to live as a normal person.  She will be an aristocrat. The rest of the world may have abandoned  her, but I have not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>You and your stupid martyr complex… are  you listening to yourself? Now, Kaname I’d feel sorry for, except she  doesn’t want my sympathy. That’s just patronising. For you, it’s just a  bizarre resolve and a lot of buried resentment. </em>But Momomi felt uneasy, all the same, though she kept her face impassive and her eyes steady. <em>So  this is how Olesa treats her mother? It’s a stupidly indulgent  attitude… what kind of warped world is it where a child talks about  their mother as if they’re the senior in the relationship? And did she  actually ask whether this was what her mother wants? I’m sure she’d be  told otherwise, but Olesa’s the type who think it’s cool to bear a  burden despite what other people want. Well, that’s fine. I wouldn’t  want to live like that.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But that’s merely why I should hate  all the Phareli,” Olesa said conversationally. “Why I hate you is  intrinsically more personal. My father was at least comforted by the  fact that I was his child, but my mother, on some level, was  disappointed. She still is. I am not the child of the man she loves.  You are. I can’t claim to be very rational in this, but I do hate you  for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that makes sense, for someone as insecure as you. You really do have to please your mother in everything, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I didn’t have a father. Or a sister. Amiki and mother, that’s all I  have. But I think it’s very natural for a child to want to please its  parent. You may be different, Phareli-san, you tend to be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can drop the san,” Momomi said, smiling in a slightly twisted way. “We’re friends, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As  for the rest, it really is a story you should be familiar with,  Phareli-san,” Olesa continued. “We have always been rivals, ever since  you came to this school, and you have always had a slight edge, despite  that fact that you are lazy, easily distracted and with a terrible work  ethic. You represent the entitlement and money I do not have, but you  have no appreciation. You accept it as a fact of life. More than that,  you seek to throw it off, in childish rebellion. You are beautiful and  intelligent but you squander that in inactivity. I saw you for what you  were, and when I discovered who you were I hated you even more, and  ever since then I have conspired against you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s pretty pathetic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,  but I’m glad. You have acknowledged me, Phareli-san. Standing here, you  acknowledge me. That makes everything worthwhile, and it does blunt my  resentment just a little bit. You respect me as an enemy, if nothing  else.” Olesa sat on the table, relaxing her posture. “Kenjou-san has  never been so fortunate, concerning Ohtori-san. That will continue to  devour her, and nothing you have done- nothing you can do- will change  that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So? Is that all?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s all that’s between us,  Phareli-san, from beginning to end. I’ve said my piece, and I expect  you to understand. But don’t think anything has changed. I will  continue to oppose you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, right now I have you over a  barrel. Once my parents are here, you’ll be kept busy. You may even  have to deal with the man you hate so much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa said nothing, her gaze steady.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One more thing,” Momomi said. “How about you, Amiki?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  about me?” the girl asked. She was leaning against the bookshelf,  feigning a casual attitude. But there was a lot of tension in her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think of all this? And are you really fine being a pawn?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hate you, your family and your friend,” Amiki said. “I don’t have very  complex reasons for that. And I am not entirely a pawn. I choose to  stay by Olesa, and I will continue to do so. I’m not sure whether you  ever gave Kaname that choice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname can walk away whenever she likes,” Momomi said. But wheels started to turn…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, it’s probably time that we headed to the Church,” Amiki continued. “Kaname might even be there before us, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi tried to keep her expression neutral, but she was worrying now, and it showed. <em>Damn,  how much time has passed? I lost track, talking about our parents and  arguing and playing mind games…irresponsible of me. And she didn’t come  here. I wonder whether she went back to our room…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Phareli-san?” Olesa asked with mock concern.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  going on ahead,” Momomi said, as casually as she could manage. She  turned and walked away, a walk that became a run a few moments before  she was truly out of hearing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What an idiot,” Amiki murmured.  “I’m amazed that you acknowledged her at all, Olesa…” She turned to  find that her mistress was busy with her phone. “What are you doing  now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tell me, Alicia,” Olesa said quietly, not looking up. “Have you ever heard of the expression <em>hoisted on your own petard</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before her servant could reply, she pressed send.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  ducked and looked down the aisles of the library, wondering if Kaname  had got lost or bored, but there was no sign of her. So she turned  around and walked out the door instead. The rain had only got worse  since Momomi had last been outside. It hit her brown hair in great  lumps, moistening and cooling it uncomfortably. She hastily put up her  umbrella, cursing all sudden storms, and ran towards the Church. The  whole wide panorama of the forest past was devoid of activity, everyone  already in the cover of one building or the other. <em>Kaname. Why  didn’t you come to the library? Have I upset you? Or maybe you just  decided that you aren’t at my beck and call. Yeah, that makes sense. I  shouldn’t have forgotten that. But I’m out of breath now, I hope you’re  happy. </em>She pushed open the doors of the Church and stepped  through, eyes sweeping the expanse. There were dozens of people there,  taking shelter from the rain, huddling informally on the benches and  chatting away. <em>Kaname won’t be part of that. She’ll be aloof and  away from everyone else, perhaps leaning against a wall with her head  bowed. That’s her way. </em>Momomi looked around, her heart leaping  when she spotted a splash of blue hair. But that was just Amane,  leaning against the wall in that exact pose she’d envisioned in her  mind. <em>Perhaps they’re more alike than I thought. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She walked forwards, finding Shion from amidst the crowd. “Hey!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, hi,” Shion replied, looking up. “Ready to begin? Even in this weather?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where’s Kaname?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know. I haven’t seen her. Isn’t she with you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, obviously not, I’m looking for her,” Momomi snapped by way of reply. She turned and walked back the way she came.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Isn’t she going to be here in a few minutes?” Shion shouted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,” Momomi replied. <em>So why do I say that? </em>“She might slack off again, you know. She’s hardly above that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is something wrong?” Shion asked sharply, standing and following her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really,” Momomi said defensively. She broke into a run before Shion could say anything else. <em>It’s just a waste of time, anyway. Shion can think what she likes.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She stepped into the rain again, clumsily putting up her umbrella while she jogged and heading for the dorms. <em>God,  I’m tired already. Am I really this unfit? I guess that’s what happens  when you mope in a small room all day, every day, but it’s not  encouraging. Kaname… now Kaname does the same thing, but she still ends  up doing so well at sports. It must be an innate talent, or something  weird. Very annoying. </em>Her bag almost slipped from her shoulders. She dragged it back into place without looking, still running on. <em>Because  Kaname’s like that. She’s just really good at everything she does. It’s  nothing to do with manners or personality, because she scores terribly  on both counts. But she’s talented and proud. I like that about her. </em>Water  splashed up where she trod, wetting her leggings, but she didn’t slow  down, even if that would be more graceful. A foreboding had gripped her  and it wasn’t letting go. <em>Her personality suits her, though. It’s  not elegant or friendly or open or even particularly pleasant, but it’s  rugged and strong, independent, and she never says die, even when she  really should. I like that about her. </em>She almost tripped over  Amiki and Olesa, walking the other way, but she slid aside and ignoring  whatever it was they said. It wasn’t important. <em>But there’s still  that vulnerable side, though, the sensitivity that more than one person  plays on, but still, I like to think I see it more than anyone else. I  know how to smile, the things to say, to get through her cool and aloof  mask. I guess, because I can do that, she makes me feel special in some  way. </em>She staggered up the steps and stepped into the Strawberry  Dorms, heading for their room. She kept her umbrella at arm’s length,  acutely aware of how wet it was, and ignored the clusters of students  crowding the corridors. She couldn’t deal with that. Sighing in  exhaustion, she opened the door and stepped into their room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  wasn’t there, either. Momomi dumped her bag on the floor and stuck her  head in the bathroom, just to make sure. She couldn’t see Kaname’s bag,  either, which suggested she hadn’t been back. <em>So just leaves one more obvious… not even she could be that stupid, right? </em>Momomi  searched through Kaname’s belongings, finding her umbrella, then  hesitated. She put back in the draw where she’d found it, turning and  closing the door quietly. <em>There’s no way she’s there. There’ s no  way. Not even Kaname would stay outside in this weather, even under a  tree… heck, at this rate, being under a tree in this weather will be  bloody dangerous. </em>She’d managed to catch her breath a little,  which was just as well, because now she needed to run again. She almost  bumped into someone, muttered an apology, and moved on before she’d  noticed who it was. Clattering down the stairs, she felt her breath  come even faster. <em>Goddamnit. Maybe I should use my phone…no, I  don’t think that would help right now. When Kaname gets like this, it’s  all up to me. She really can’t look after herself at all. It makes me  worry. </em>For the umpteenth time, she jumped out into the rain. Her  arms were already aching, so she held her umbrella at arm’s length  without opening it. This way was more aerodynamic, too. Of course, now  the rain stained her blazer, pinning it uncomfortably close. <em>I  should have taken it up while I was in the room. Or put a coat on. I  haven’t been thinking properly. Now, where could she be? She might be  moping around the paddock again, after all, and I’d feel bloody stupid  if that’s the case. Or the alternative… either way, she’ll need me to  get her to come in out of the rain. The lake’s closer, so I’ll head  there. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her breath rasped in her throat, making her feel a little stupid. <em>To  run everywhere in weather like this… isn’t it foolish? And going this  far is a little needless, or it should be, but if she had something  important to say she might be upset. Very upset, depending on how she  takes it. So it’s important I don’t make things worse than they are.  And if I’m tired when I arrive, it’ll look I made the effort. Did I  just think that? That’s pretty low, to think of something like that,  but it is true. Even a little thing like that. If it will make a  difference, I’m fine with being tired and aching from all the  unexpected activity, and I’m fine with embarrassing myself in front of  people too. But what will she say? Is she still going to go through  with it? I still don’t know what’s going to happen myself, let alone  how to respond to it. Hopefully everything will be alright when I turn  up, I’ll think of the right reply on the spot and it will be fine, but  that sounds hopelessly naïve. Nothing is that simple in life. I should  probably apologise first, though…no, I should definitely apologise  first. That will take her off guard, hopefully, because it damn well  isn’t something I do often. Then I take her out of the rain. Whatever  it is, it can be said in the dry. After that, I’ll put her in the  shower again, and get yet another spare uniform for her. No, we need to  be at the Church. Does that matter? Maybe we should skip and suffer  from Kariya’s wrath later. It depends on the situation. She might  welcome the distraction. Did she get my message, I wonder? Perhaps her  phone was off… if it was I’ll have to say where I was. Maybe I should  mention what I learned, it’d give her a great chance to rag on my  father and Olesa and aristocrats in general. But that might offend her,  too, to make it seem like what Olesa had said was more important, so-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Before  she knew where she was, she was at the lake. And Kaname was there,  soaked to the skin. All Momomi could see was the back of her head, blue  hair plastered to her scalp, but somehow it threw her completely off.  “Hi…” she mumbled, panting for breath. “Sorry I’m late, something came  up. Well, I guess I’m really late by now, aren’t I? Did you get my  message?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname said nothing, shoulders stiff as she looked over the surface of the lake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  walked nervously forwards, opening her umbrella. “Here, come on,” she  said. “We should come out of the rain. You’re definitely going to catch  a cold like that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This time, Kaname looked at her, and her red  eyes were like flint, hard and unmoving. Like flint, too, there was a  potential there, the sense of a smooth surface that could catch and  throw up sparks, burning points of light that could consume an entire  forest if given time. She tossed her phone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The throw was  deliberately weak, landing somewhere between them and making Momomi  stoop instinctively to pick it up. “You’ve got this wet as well,” she  said irrelevantly. “You’ll break it.” Then she saw what was on there,  and knew what it was even before she’d clicked play for confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I  want you to picture someone. She’s your age, your height, shares many  of your characteristics. But she is a more perfect being. She has all  the privileges and wealth and comfort you lack, but she is complacent,  diffuse, arrogant, never-”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d never been particularly fond  of Olesa, but in that moment the mere sound of her voice filled Momomi  with a sickening wave of anger and resentment, enough to make her want  to scream. But as her head slumped forwards she knew there was  self-hate too. She remembered where that conversation had gone. <em>I  said stupid things, I allowed myself to be led, I allowed myself to be  fooled. And now all Kaname knows is a Momomi who’s contemptuous of her  behind her back. </em>“Kaname, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So,” the blue-haired girl said in a dangerous voice. “So… well, there’s nothing to say, really, now is there?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname, listen to me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why the fuck should I?” Kaname exploded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  felt her eyes widen in shock at the outburst. It cut her to the core.  Almost involuntarily, she took a step backwards, trying to find  something, anything to say.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve been waiting here for over half  an hour in the bloody rain because I told you to come here and you  promised and it was important!” Kaname advanced on her, eyes wild. “So  much for your promises! You have no idea, do you? How much I’ve  suffered over these past few days, thinking about you and thinking  about you? Even when I’d come to a decision, I spent all day working up  the courage to ask you something very important. A very important  thing. Do you know what I was going to ask you, Momomi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t  know,” Momomi whispered. She was being led, she knew, but she couldn’t  find the force or the will to do anything but be battered wherever  Kaname wanted her to go.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was going to ask you exactly what I  am to you,” Kaname said, gritting her teeth. “Because I dared wonder  whether I might actually be your friend, not just another chess piece!  I thought that maybe, just maybe, when you smiled and when you said  friendly things, you might actually be sincere, and not just using me  another way to make me your slave!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was sincere!” Momomi shouted back, as loudly as she could.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“On  your terms,” Kaname said. “Always on your terms. I didn’t want your  terms, I wanted our terms! Can you understand that? That’s why I called  you here! But it’s fine, I’ve had confirmation. Even at a moment like  this, Momomi has more important things to do, listening to bloody Olesa  of all people, because plainly she’s a lot more important than I ever  was. Is it because she’s clever? Is it because she can lie like you  can? What is it? Why is she the important one?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now you’re just being immature!” Momomi screamed back. “It’s nothing like that, I just-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  wanted to spend some time patronising me behind my back, like all the  rest,” Kaname said. “Don’t speak like you know everything. Don’t  pretend you’re a saint. And don’t bother to say that you’re different,  any more, different from all the other bloody immature brats who look  down on me because I’m poor and different. You’re just the same as  them!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s got nothing to do with it,” Momomi replied  raggedly, fists balling. “You know, Kariya’s right, you’re the one with  a bloody persecution complex. Not everything revolved around your  poverty! It doesn’t make you special! Stop giving yourself bloody airs  about the fact that you got here on your own merit! That doesn’t mean  we’ll pay more attention to you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why, then?” Kaname demanded,  stepping forwards again. Rain splashing across her cheek. “You tell me  why the fuck everyone in this sodding dump hates me! You’re all so  bloody graceful and polite and pleasant to my face, but that doesn’t  stop you from whispering about me when you think I can’t here. Even  you! What the fuck do you know about me and Amane? Who the fuck are you  to call me pathetic?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it is pathetic!” Momomi screamed  back. “Look at yourself! Every bloody chance you get you’re up there,  mooning over her, and when it’s not that you’re screeching about how  you’re going to beat her! You say you hate her but she’s your life,  left, right and centre! You’re not the only one who gets ignored! Don’t  make yourself out to be any different from me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m different!”  Kaname snarled. “I’m honest! I say what I think to all of you,  especially about Amane, and my god I hate Amane. But you know, I hate  you even more. And do you know why? At least Amane has the dignity to  talk straight! She doesn’t lead you on with a pretty face and a smile  and spit venom at you beneath the mask!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least I validate  your existence!” Momomi was crying now, tears of anger and pain and  frustration, but she kept on shouting through it all, voice shaking  slightly. “At least I give a damn! Perhaps you’ve noticed, but Amane  doesn’t care if you live or die. She’s a rival who’s so far above you  she doesn’t even notice your existence!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She doesn’t pretend to be my friend!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi’s shoulders shook. “No,” she managed. “She never did, did she? But I swear, I never pretended either, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t talk crap!” Kaname shouted. “You lead me on! You lead me on and then you betrayed me!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  lead you on?” Momomi returned. “All I ever did was show some civil  decency, which is more than you’ve ever done! Day and night, whenever  asked, I’m your enemy! That’s all you ever said! No matter how close I  got to you, I was always your enemy! Don’t come crying to me about your  own dishonesty, if I take your own words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you know why I  chose to meet here, of all places? Because this is where Momomi told me  about Momomi. At the time, I was flattered that you let me into your  world. But now I don’t know. I don’t know a fucking thing!” Kaname  threw her right arm out in frustration, embracing the whole panorama in  one sweep. “Everything you said here, everything you said everywhere, I  can’t trust any of it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not my fault! It’s not my fault  you’re a bloody paranoid schizophrenic! At least be consistent!” Momomi  threw the phone back at her, hitting Kaname’s shoulder. “Olesa! Why the  hell do you trust her words? You tell me what’s so special about her!  If I knew you were this easy to lead I wouldn’t have bothered!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  right,” Kaname said more quietly, her voice locked in a cold anger. “I  was easy to lead. That was my mistake, because you just walked all over  me! You, of all people, you, after what you said, you have no right to  tell me who to trust!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll tell you anyway, to trust one more  time,” Momomi said, managing to meet Kaname’s eyes. The tears were  still flowing but she still felt a desperate strength. “Listen to me!  Just listen, and don’t just shout and live in your own comfortable  world without explanations!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Comfortable? Do you think I’m  enjoying this? Another betrayal the moment I came to trust?” Kaname  laughed, a sour, ugly sound. “The story of my fucking life. So I don’t  give a shit how you’re going to sweet-talk your way out of this one!  I’m not listening any more!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So if you don’t like it you don’t hear it? That’s just immature!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Immature?”  Kaname scowled, her face twisted by fury. “You’re a one to talk! I’ve  bent at the waist to accommodate you, your every childish whim, your  tantrums, your stupid bloody games! And every time you’ve done  something stupid, it’s up to me to save your ass!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, really?”  Momomi stepped forwards, almost bumping into the blue-haired girl and  raising her head furiously. “That’s bloody rich from the brat who can’t  clean her clothes, brush her hair, take a shower, stay out of the rain,  without me holding her hand! I’m sick and tired of mothering you,  already, it’s not a bloody game any more. You just do what you like,  whatever gratifies your infantile feelings, and I have to take  responsibility, I have to pull your tail out of the fire! Sweet-talking  teachers, cleaning you up, its all my job!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one asked you to  do that,” Kaname said. “I can look after myself, far more than you can!  I’ve looked after myself on streets so rough you can’t even begin to  imagine them, never quite sure where the next meal was coming from,  always a step from being mugged, raped, shot! You’re just wrapped up in  your prissy little fantasy world, but you’d never stand a fucking  chance in reality! You’re pathetic!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell does that  matter? Why the hell are you proud of that? You came here, didn’t you,  so it can’t be that bloody wonderful. Getting off on your family  history is pathetic enough at the best of times, but it’s worse from  you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Likewise!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I don’t, so just listen!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  done nothing but listen for six months, Kiyashiki, and I’m through! I’m  not going to be one of your fucking pawns any more! Do what you like,  I’m through!” She turned away, face furious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Go ahead!” Momomi yelled helplessly. “If I’d known you were this bad, I’ve have… I’d have…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname had already disappeared into the trees. Momomi sank to her knees, feeling fury and rationality war in her. <em>I  should… I should follow her, right? It’s the right thing to do, right?  But…but…I can’t. I’m too angry. I’m too ashamed. I’m too saddened. I  can’t do anything at all. </em>“Kaname!” She shouted that to an angry  sky, but her voice wavered and broke, fresh tears washing down her  sodden face, sobs wracking her chest. “Just… listen, already.” She fell  forwards, tears splattering on the grass. “Kaname…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The rain  slackened, and by degrees, stopped, clouds blown away by the wisps of  wind that trembled the trees and shook her hair gently. But still a  girl cried under a clear sky.</span></p>
