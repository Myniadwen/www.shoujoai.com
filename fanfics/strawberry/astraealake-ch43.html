<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>They say  that when you sleep, your dreams are the filing and categorization of  your day. The office workers of the mind, having slacked off doing  everything they could possibly do except thinking all day, are finally  forced to tighten their belts and get some work done at night. In the  dead of night, one thinks or sleeps and dreams, because it’s not like  there’s anything else to do. It’s amazing the lengths people go to  ensure that they don’t think. I should know. That’s not necessarily a  bad thing, either. People talk about having time to think as if it’s a  mature, intellectual, wonderful thing, but it doesn’t have to be that,  not necessarily. No more so than watching television, reading a book,  or watching a film has to be intellectual. When you have too much time  to think, too much to think about, your mind drifts round and round, in  ever-widening circles, embracing the same ground in different ways. And  ultimately, it thinks stupid things. Needless doubts and pointless  worries, the kind of concern that may be legitimate but remains useless  for the purposes of everyday life. In other words, superfluous thinking  is as much as a waste of time as any other activity can be. </em>Kaname snorted and turned over, still half-asleep. <em>Thinking  like this, basically. That’s why dreams are so good, at least that way  we can multitask something. Isn’t that a female thing? No one to make  cracks about me being like a guy, not when I’m just thinking. It’s not  very fair. If I’m that much like a guy, why would she like me? It’s  just plain illogical… </em>She groaned into her pillow. <em>Whatever.  Not thinking enough is also a bad idea, and to judge by last night… my  dreams tried to do about two weeks’ worth of backlog thinking in one  night. My head hurts. Bloody weird dreams…</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A door opening.  The intake of breath. Soft feet padding across the floor. Kaname rolled  over and sat up, yawning hugely. Actually, she’d rather go to sleep for  another three hours at least, but she’d force herself. Besides,  Momomi’s surprised face made her heart beat a lot faster, fast enough  to shake the last vestiges of sleep from her body. “Morning,” she  managed. The word didn’t suit her. It was too formal. She was well used  to not having to greet Momomi in the mornings. She was just… there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hi,”  Momomi replied. She looked wrong-footed for a moment, then she smiled.  “Still in bed? Honestly, Kaname, you really are useless without me,  aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not my fault,” Kaname grumbled, relieved. She rubbed her head. “<em>Someone </em>kept me up at an ungodly hour, knowing I had a proper schoolday in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t  change the fact that you can’t get out of bed in the morning,” Momomi  teased. She was sorting through her drawers, looking for the clothes  she needed for the day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname watched her thoughtfully. <em>Normally she’d have them all laid out… didn’t have time, yesterday. </em>“It’s  not like I can’t get up sometimes, you know. I just like a healthy  night’s sleep. Maybe a waif like you wouldn’t understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder.” Momomi pulled a shirt out and shook it out, checking for creases.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her nightclothes and dressing gown, both slightly too big for her. “So you stayed at Shion’s.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi took a breath before she replied, her voice catching slightly. “Yeah.” She tried to find something else to say. “Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  clambered out of bed, waving her hands. “It’s not like there’s anything  to be sorry about… it always embarrasses me, when you’re so formal…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That was my line.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Last  night.” Momomi glanced at her, forcing a smile again. “It’s just a  funny thing, isn’t it? We’re not normally the kind of person who  apologizes, for the most part we’d rather lose a tooth than have one  dragged out of us, but right now… a little ironic, really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  is, a little,” Kaname agreed. She tried to remember how it went. “Well,  don’t get used to it or anything… it’s not like I’m doing it for your  entertainment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perish the thought.” Momomi piled her clothes on  the bed, then turned and froze momentarily. It was quick, her face  twisting briefly in surprise, and then she turned and headed for the  bathroom with a serene face, her perfect mask.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname followed her gaze, and found the vase. <em>So  that’s what bothered her… and she’s bothered, I can read her enough for  that at least. Was I supposed to do that? It’s not like I know the  etiquette on these occasions… </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you going to stand there all day?” Momomi asked, her voice muffled by the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t even see me,” Kaname retorted, annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Inactivity has a special noise all of its own, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Oh, well. They’re nice flowers. That’s reason enough to keep them, isn’t it? </em>“I’m  going, I’m going,” Kaname said out loud, trying to find a workable  shirt and skirt from her own messy drawers. She sighed at the mess.  “You know, all things considered, I should be the independent one,  shouldn’t I? It’s not like I had servants to wait on me or anything…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what went wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  first you learn how to live independently, then you start to realize  how many times it’s easier to cut corners. Something like that.” Kaname  shrugged. “I’m only an irresponsible teenager, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does that make me mature or childish, then, if I’m the one who insists on being neat?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  shrugged a fresh shirt on and started to button it up. “Don’t ask me.  I’m just glad you find the energy to bother about two people, when my  track record’s none.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somebody has to.” Momomi stuck her head  out the door, then retreated again when she saw Kaname struggling with  her skirt. “Hurry up, I have to return this stuff to Shion, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m hurrying, already. I always hurry.” Kaname smiled. <em>It’s a strange thing to be glad for routine, but that’s what I want now. Let things be as they used to be.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They switched places, Kaname washing her face briefly then checking herself in the mirror. She rubbed her red eyes. <em>Didn’t get enough sleep last night, what with one thing and the other. </em>Then  she brushed her teeth and looked at herself, literally red-eyed and  with her ruffled blue hair, made even more untidy by sleeping on it. It  stood up on one side, crumpled and curly, and generally looked pretty  stupid. She self-consciously ran a hand through it, smoothing it down.  And somehow, unbidden, the thought came into her head. <em>So why does  Momomi like me anyway? I mean, even if someone had told me, I’d  consider it weird, worry about it for a while, and then dismiss the  thought. It’s just such a… well; it’s such a weird idea. If it wasn’t  for the fact that last night was completely burned into my mind, I’d  dismiss it as so much fantasy. I mean… Momomi liking me? It’s not like  I hate myself or anything but I always thought she knew too much about  me to like me. </em>Kaname smirked at the mirror. <em>My morning face,  for example. I could understand if she started crushing on one of the  Etoiles like everyone else in the school, or Shion, a senpai, something  like that. I’d think it was bloody stupid but I’d understand. She only  sees them at their best and most graceful, and they’re beautiful and,  well, older than me. She sees me at my worst and I’m the one who looks  weird and acts weird, an awkward, defensive tomboy kind of girl without  any friends except her. I don’t really get it, but I suppose it shows  she’s not shallow or anything. My personality’s pretty terrible as  well, though. So should I berate her for having bad taste? I doubt  she’d appreciate that… but I’m glad, in a selfish way. I always thought  that she might start going out with someone, and I’d see her less… now  that is a selfish thought. I don’t have any right to monopolize her  time, least of all now. But I can dream, can’t I?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When she  emerged, Momomi was busy combing her hair. Kaname smiled at the sight;  it wasn’t like her friend didn’t need to do that either. <em>That’s the  secret, isn’t it? Beautiful people have to work at it too, some more  and some less. But with the Etoiles, we only see the end result. With  Momomi, I know the preparation, such as it is, so I’m as used to her  with bed hair as she is to me like that. It’s less glamorous. On the  other hand, the Etoiles see other like that as well. I guess couples  can’t exist in willful self-delusion, so there’s no need to start that  way either. Feels like that would make it easier, though. People are  more decisive when they think things are simple. Doesn’t matter if they  really are simple, they just have to think that. So why did Momomi say  all that when things are so complicated?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as introspective as ever,” Momomi observed. “Didn’t you tease me for that before?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s nothing,” Kaname observed hastily. “You don’t need to worry about it. I was just… worried, before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With good reason.” Momomi sighed. “I’m sorry I made you worry.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry I ever started with the apologizing,” Kaname replied. “It’s getting really annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  what else would you have said?” Momomi shrugged the bitterness out of  her voice and smiled, looking into the mirror. “At least you had an  excuse. All I’m protecting is my cowardice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gave her a serious look, wishing she’d face her. “I’m the same, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  put her comb down and stepped past her with calculated carelessness.  “Well, that’s hardly new for either of us, either. That’s the kind of  people we are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sat down and folded her arms. “I guess so. We shouldn’t change it suddenly, it makes me feel weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed, briefly and ironically. “I’ll bear that in mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, I didn’t-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  not it,” Momomi said hastily. “I just thought it was… funny. Hurry up  and stay the same, you know? It really is the kind of people we are; we  like to feel safe. Because we know what it feels like when things  really do go wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Kaname replied automatically. <em>Like hell you thought that. Who’s worse; the one who came up with that evasion? Or the one who accepted it?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll pack our books,” Momomi said, rooting through the cupboard. “I know where your timetable is. Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh… sure.” Kaname glanced at her, frowning, but Momomi’s back wasn’t very expressive. <em>Which  would be worse? To call her on it and prompt an unpleasant  confrontation? Or to let it slide and make her think I never cared in  the first place?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks like we’ve both get History again.  Which reminds me, we haven’t caught up on it at all… I guess we’ll play  it by the ear, just like before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s all the same to me. The  same old principles… hasn’t really changed since Sunny’s day, you  know?” Kaname was suddenly glad Momomi was looking the other way. She  wasn’t like Momomi; she found it harder to fake a smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sunny?” Momomi snorted. “You really don’t have any reverence at all, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m very suspicious of reverent people. Seems to me that they don’t know when to laugh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like my father.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More  like my mother… she should try it, laughter might help.” Kaname picked  up her comb and started to brush her hair, a little more violently than  was strictly necessary. <em>We know what it feels like when things go wrong, is it? </em>She bit her lip. <em>All the same, nothing changes.</em></span></p>
They  made painfully small talk for a few minutes while Momomi packed their  bags, then went for breakfast. Momomi lead, with her quick, confident  stride, and Kaname followed, walking a little slower than she otherwise  would, always content to take her pace from her friend. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’ve always been that way. </span></em>It  was a strange thought to have on a strange morning, but when she  reflected on it, it was true enough. Momomi was completely herself now,  which was to say, smiling and talking and light and, essentially,  emotionless, colourless, very transient, and somehow absent, even when  she was there. Perhaps someone who knew her less well would be fooled;  Kaname was not, she knew her friend well, but she’d forgive her. All  the same, it was a little disheartening. She closed her eyes  momentarily and stuck her hands in her pockets. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Well, how would I  feel in her place? Disappointed? Knowing me, I’d throw a temper  tantrum. So I’ll shut up and stay the same, because it’s Momomi who  changes, and I believe in her. She’ll feel better after a while. Well,  that’s what I think anyway. I have to think that, as my own inability  means I can’t consider the consequences of her not coming round. </span></em>She frowned. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Perish the thought that Kaname Kenjou might have to take the initiative in her friendship for once. </span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned and looked around as they neared the canteen. “Well, I’d better take this back to Shion’s room.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Okay. Shall I come with? I can always eat later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shook her head. “No, I don’t want to trouble you. Can you get my  breakfast? I’ll have whatever you’re having.” She smiled. “As long as  it’s not fish, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded again. “Sure. See you in a second.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname walked on into the canteen, trying not to make too much of it. <em>This  is the first time in a long time I came here alone… she just has to  return clothes, though. And she could have left me at our door, but she  came this far with me, even though it’s out of her way. I’m  overanalysing, that’s all. </em>She looked about the crowded room in a  desultory way only to find three people looking at her. She recognised  that kind of look. It was how people appeared when they’d been talking  about you and you suddenly entered the frame, an analytical, slightly  cold stare. <em>Apart from Olesa, I’ll allow that much. Olesa just looks like that all the damn time. </em>She  nodded briefly at them then turned back to queuing. Today was Japanese  style. There would be fish. She tapped her feet impatiently, annoyed.  Normally she had Momomi’s conversation, at least, to distract her from  how much she hated standing in a line and waiting. <em>It cuts against my instincts. I’d rather be in a free-for-all and take my chances with the older girls. </em>But  she placed the two orders quicker than she’d hoped, and struggled over  to the others with two trays. No one was quite sure when and how they’d  moved from a diaspora to one consolidated table, or under whose  leadership the shift had occurred, but it had happened. Kaname  preferred being alone with Momomi, free of annoying distractions and  banal conversation, but still, there were worse ways to spend her time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Where’s Momomi?” Amiki asked, direct as ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Dropping something off,” Kaname replied neutrally, sitting down and putting one of the trays in front of the seat next to her. <em>Why is she always Momomi to people when she’s not around? </em>“She’ll be back in a second.” <em>Am I Kaname to them, when I’m not around? It’s an odd thought.</em></span></p>
“I see.” Amiki paused to drink some of her soup. “So… how did the rest of your date go?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It wasn’t a date.” Kaname had intended to sound sharp, but she just  came across as tired. “God, it’s annoying when you say stupid stuff  like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright, alright, forgive me.” Amiki’s eyes narrowed. “So stop dodging the question. How did it go?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was alright.” Kaname dredged, with effort, details from her memory.  Last night was feeling incredibly distant. “We watched this film,  called the Lake something… Shack? Barn? Time travel headquarters? It  was very weird, Momomi said it was a romance but it felt more like a  very slow kind of sci-fi film. Something about lost technology  post-boxes and time travel and trying not to destroy the universe, and  I’m sure there was something about bringing two people together so the  messiah of the future could be born.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wasn’t that the Terminator?” Amiki asked doubtfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not in this case,” Shion said. “I think Kenjou-kun’s just being obscure.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it’s not like we see many films either.” Amiki frowned. “That’s hardly the point, though…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Words  unsaid echoed above them. Kaname didn’t feel like saying them. “It was  fine. Coming back was a pain, though. I ended up having to take Shion’s  advice after all, and I nearly got caught more than once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See?  Good planning is always useful. As a back-up option, if nothing else.”  Shion beamed. “Now aren’t you glad you listened to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really. They’d cut down one of the trees in the second wall and I  almost broke my neck realising there was nowhere to jump to. Then I  almost got caught by a Sister, like I said.” Kaname glared. “If it  wasn’t for the fact that I didn’t have Momomi to worry about, I’d have  ended up in the disciplinary room. Or the hospital. One of the two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shion  coughed to cover the surprise of the other two. “Oh, my… I guess I  should have checked the route. I last took it in my first year, after  all. Well, you learn something everyday, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re as casual as ever.” Kaname glared. “I nearly died out there!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. Who else would have had any useful information on such short  notice?” Shion pouted. “You mocked me last night for knowing anything  at all. You can’t have it both ways, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just rolled her eyes. “Whatever. I survived somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How is Kiyashiki-san?” Olesa’s voice was as impassive as ever, but her eyes were sharp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s fine,” Kaname replied awkwardly. “Why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tomori-senpai’s given us to understand that you rejected her romantic advances. I thought this might have upset her somewhat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  felt like she’d just been slapped. Olesa just gave her a neutral look  and went back to her breakfast. “You told them?” She tried to get some  proper anger into her voice. “That’s nice to know, going behind  Momomi’s back at the first opportunity...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not that low.” Shion was unexpectedly brusque. “Her friends, only. As she has few friends, that means those two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  we’ve no-one to tell. It’s not important.” Olesa appeared to have  recovered from her cold, at least, though Kaname couldn’t really see  any difference.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you really are an idiot, Kaname,” Amiki  said, shaking her head. “I knew were oblivious but I didn’t know you  were that bad about this…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What now?” Kaname demanded, running a  hand through her hair. “It’s not a matter of being smart or stupid, is  it? I just don’t like girls, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What would you do, if you did like girls?” Shion mused, cocking her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  just blushed. “Well, I- she’s my best friend, isn’t she? Isn’t that  kinda weird? I enjoy talking to her, so that’s enough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa looked up momentarily. “It’s always enough until it isn’t. You should be careful.” Then she returned to her food.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Was that profound or just pointless?” Shion wondered. “It’s always hard to tell with you, Perez-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Olesa just shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So what’s up now?” Momomi sat down, slightly out of breath.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing,” Kaname replied guiltily. “These three were saying weird things again, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Excuse  me?” Amiki gave her a sharp look. “Did we go on a pseudo-drunken rant  on the nature of religion and the world as it corresponds to a  croissant roll?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think I’ve ever done that.” Kaname  folded her arms defensively. “You shouldn’t put words in other people’s  mouths, it’s not clever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Give you time. You’ll get there eventually.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually,  there are worse topics for a rant,” Shion observed. “You should add it  to your rotation, Kenjou-kun. Soon you’ll have one for every occasion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think I memorise them or something? Don’t insult me. All my spiels are completely spontaneous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t know which would be more worrying, that you took the time to work  them out and learn them, or that you actually have a brain addled  enough to spew them out on demand.” Amiki shook her head cynically.  “And she calls us weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “Well, it’s a talent,  isn’t it? A way with words.” She prodded her breakfast unhappily.  “Fish, is it? More’s my misfortune.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname grunted. “I’ll eat it, if you like. You can have my miso, or something, I haven’t touched it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  it’s fine.” Momomi busied herself with her chopsticks. “I mean, I’m  staying here. I might as well get used to eating fish, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah…  sure.” Kaname returned to her own food, feeling vaguely disappointed.  “That’s true. I guess I should learn to brush my hair, too.” She didn’t  plan to say it, but somehow she did anyway. <em>That’s what you get for excess thinking with your tongue unguarded.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,” Momomi agreed. “That might be a good idea.” She toyed with her fish. “You’re a teenager, after all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This isn’t what I want. </em>“I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  still… I don’t like the taste of fish, just generally. Like I said,  it’s a family thing, none of us like it. Perhaps I just find it  strange, but…” her voice trailed off. The others looked between them;  aware they weren’t quite seeing something important.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I should say something, anything, but what can I say? </em>“Well, I don’t like pickles, and I live here,” Kaname began. “It’s natural enough that you don’t like certain kinds of food.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>God, but I suck at this.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname went to her lessons with a twitching, if displaced, sense of wrongness. <em>Somewhere,  somehow, things aren’t the way they should be. And it’s not like I  don’t know it. I’m just hoping it’ll turn out okay. How pathetic is  that?</em> The thought haunted her as she went through the motions of  studying, but this time she did work at it, simply because the  alternative was to think and she wasn’t sure she wanted to do that  right now. Other students talked to her, for the first time in a long  while. The subject was always Momomi, the Phareli, stuff like that, all  the rumors that had been going round the school about it. Kaname was  vaguely glad that the rumors were one step behind; she wasn’t in a mood  to discuss the complications to their relationship with a random clutch  of her peers. But not everyone was as worryingly efficient as Shion.  She replied as neutrally as she could, except to the one girl who  rather snootily implied that Kaname was onto a good thing by hanging  onto the coat tails of a heiress. Kaname didn’t mention the fact that  the extent of Momomi’s current worth to her family could be measured in  a casual present used to buy clothes. But she did tell that student to  jump off a bridge and take her damn arrogance with her. It was all so…  bothersome. Unnecessary. Momomi didn’t say unnecessary things, or when  she did, they were interesting at least. If Kaname didn’t want to talk,  Momomi would let her be. The rest of them didn’t understand that. They  didn’t know, the same way Momomi did, that personal space was also  something you kept in your head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lunch, something she’d  anticipated and dreaded, didn’t go much better. It was nothing  articulated, never anything articulated. But Momomi ignored her fish  without a word and somehow Kaname couldn’t speak, or hold up her  chopsticks, or do anything she’d done before. She couldn’t even find  the words to say how she was disappointed. She could understand but  that doesn’t mean she enjoyed it. All the same, she didn’t say a thing,  and so gave it her tacit consent. That’s what she reflected on when she  stared out of the window in the afternoon lessons, having given up on  work. Now was the time when she needed to think. <em>Tacit consent. If  I really think about it, that’s all I ever gave. I’m not good with  words. I always have to be so cooled, so careless, holding myself a  little distant even when I’m actually bending at the knees for her. I  always have to maintain that pretence. There’s not much I gave to her  that I didn’t hedge with my weasel words, but she gave me so much. She  initiated everything, or as close to that as to make no matter, and I  was just content to follow. And I was content to follow. Even when we  held hands, I was calling that a thing between friends, and when we fed  each other as well. But I also knew it could be looked at another way.  If Momomi had asked, “do you want to hold hands?”, I’d have blushed  furiously and told her know. But because she just did it, as if it was  such a natural thing, I accepted it, and didn’t say a word. I never  rewarded her with her courage. Like that, isn’t it inevitable that her  courage would fail before long?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed deeply, leaning on one hand and watching leaves flutter in the wind. <em>When  I think about it, what would I have done, if she’d just kissed me? As  if that was a natural thing, as well? Would I have just accepted that,  too? Surely I’d say something, make some protest, I know I’d be  shocked. But I might go along with it out of cowardice. I don’t like  appreciating what I have, and I don’t like setting out the boundaries.  I let things slide one way or the other because I don’t have the  confidence to correct them. Really, when it comes to relationships, I  can be a real coward. And now that’s come to haunt me. </em>She frowned. <em>Asking  Momomi to kiss me, though…that would be far too much. If it was me, I  wouldn’t even be able to confess, I bet. She’s just a girl, a smart  girl, a confident girl, a manipulative girl, but she’s only her age and  she’s got no experience at all. What kind of idiot would just kiss  another girl without saying anything? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She remembered Shion’s question. <em>She  makes it sound so simple, but, at the end of the day, isn’t this the  one thing I can’t fake? What if I’d said yes? Where would be? In the  end, we’d be even more unhappy. If I’m honest with myself… maybe I  would date Momomi, if she was a he. I mean, she’s cute, smart, witty,  sophisticated, sensitive, graceful, caring, but with the ruthlessness I  can associate with all the same, someone who knows me and respects my  limits. She’s almost perfect. But… male and female, isn’t that a real  divide? I can’t fake that. The thing is, I’m straight. Sure, I have a  few odd moments, but who doesn’t? Isn’t that what being a teenager’s  about? They call it being confused, or something, when an otherwise  straight girl crushes on another girl for a while. And anyone would be  confused in this school…but the majority of my, well, fantasies,  they’re about guys. And I’m still a bit wierded out by the whole  girl-on-girl thing. That makes me straight, it stands to reason. And a  straight girl can’t go out with another girl, it just doesn’t work. I  mean, I could pretend, but I’d never fool Momomi and I’d only make her  even more unhappy. I don’t want to do that. </em>She shook her head to try and clear out her troubling thoughts, tapping a finger against the desk. <em>It’s  still so… weird, though. Momomi likes me? I can’t understand that. So,  every time she was talking about her cute girl, that was me. It’s hard  to believe. Well, I’d like her myself, if she was a guy, so perhaps it  makes sense. I warned her, though, I told her that I don’t like girls  that way. So why did she mention it? Something she couldn’t hold back?  No, if she tried to be my friend without telling me she felt like that,  that’d be bad. The question’s more like… why did she have to like me?  Wouldn’t be easier if it was some other girl? If that was the case, our  friendship wouldn’t be damaged like this. </em>Kaname sighed glumly. <em>As ever, the world’s an inconvenient place. I never catch many breaks.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lessons  were over, and she went to the Church. It was almost good to get back  to dreary routine. At the very least, it was better than sitting in her  room and brooding, which she knew she’d do if she didn’t have anything  else she absolutely had to do. Even so, she didn’t relish spending an  hour with a slightly distant Momomi in the company of an inquisitive  Amiki and Olesa. Shion might even turn up out of boredom and worsen the  situation. And to top it all, the Etoiles would need to at least pass  by. If they mentioned anything she’d said last night, she swore she’d  die. Even worse was the possibly that Serané would take Momomi aside  for her improvised therapy… even if things weren’t good, she didn’t  want the Etoiles butting into her private life. It just felt wrong. <em>So why did you go and borrow a vase, after all? And from them, of all people? </em>She frowned at the treacherous voice. That one would be called Kariya from now on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  we’re all here again,” Amiki remarked. “Can’t I just have another fight  with Kaname and be done with it? This is getting boring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think that’s the idea,” Momomi remarked lightly. “So I wouldn’t advise  starting another fight, we’d only be here for another month as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki sighed and shouldered her mop. “So troublesome… I wish I could at least get you and Olesa off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ever the faithful servant?” Kaname mocked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing that grand. You’re both useless, if you don’t mind me saying so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I consider that a compliment, of a kind,” Olesa replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it isn’t going to happen, and we know it,” Kaname said. “Unless you can bribe the Etoiles or something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which isn’t going to happen, and we know it,” Amiki completed. “They certainly know how to institutionalize tedium.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now that’s a dubious talent.” Kaname gave Momomi an easy look. She was so far away…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  banged her mop against the floor decisively. “So let’s at least have a  decent division of labour. Kaname, we’ll do the tower. That’s the hard  part, and we’re the competent ones. The other two can do the church  floor, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s fine,” Olesa agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname folded  her arms. “Those two are only going to slack off if we’re away, and you  know it. More than that, you’ll let them do so.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amazingly, we can do some work without you,” Momomi replied quietly. “Not sure how, but there it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then it’s settled,” Amiki said before Kaname could reply. “Come on, you’ve lost. No whining now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  heard that way too much these past few days,” Kaname remarked, sighing.  She slouched after Amiki, sparing a glance for Momomi behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>If everything’s going to be fine, why does she look like she’s breaking apart inside?</em></span></p>
