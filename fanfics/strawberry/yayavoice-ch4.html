<p>----------<span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Hikari: Would you smile again?</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane-sempai.”  I called to her, but my thoughts where with someone else. Yaya-chan  didn’t come back to class after lunch. I had began to worry since  the first period after lunch ended. I wonder what had happened…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sempai  looked worried. I moved closer and sat beside her. My legs hurt, all  the running around I’ve been doing to look for Yaya-chan lately  seemed to be taking it’s toll on me. It was lucky that our leader  decided to postpone our practice today, I thought maybe I could find  Yaya-chan this time… considering she doesn’t know choir practice  is canceled. But I guess I was wrong and how could I forget,  Yaya-chan doesn’t have a place in the choir for now. We were quiet  for a while, I could only guess what was on her mind… or should I  say who.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sempai?  Yaya-chan didn’t go back to class a while ago. Did something  happen?” I could not hide the worry in my voice. I felt like a bad  friend. Yaya-chan could always find me when I’m troubled, why can’t  I be like that? Why can’t I ever find her?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry, Hikari.” I softly gasped at the apology. “I screwed up a  bit… I was so nervous we barely got to talk at all. And then I  accidentally hurt Nanto-san.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Hurt?!’</em> the word and all its meanings streamed into my mind. I grew more  worried about Yaya-chan with each passing second. I wanted to run and  look for her again, but I felt I should let Amane-sempai tell me all  the details first. “Yaya-chan is hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sempai  nodded and explained what happened. She told me that she was having  trouble starting the conversation with Yaya-chan, mentioning how  intimidated she was of her, something I found hard to believe,  Yaya-chan was the type that could get along with almost anyone… or  is that only how I see her? She continued that something happened and  she had unexpectedly surprised Yaya-chan by accident and which  resulted on the cut on her wrist. She tried to apologize but  Yaya-chan left her as soon as she could, she also said that she felt  that she shouldn’t follow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  see…” was all that I could say. I wonder why Yaya-chan is like  this. Come to think of it… Yaya-chan didn’t seem to like  Amane-sempai very much, which was weird since she had always been  cheering for me telling me not to give up on my feelings for her. Or  could it be?... maybe?… does Yaya-chan like Amane-sempai too?... If  she does why doesn’t she… Awww… I just managed to confuse  myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane-sempai  asked about Yaya-chan, what she liked, what she was like, what she  didn’t like… which made me realize all the more… how little I  knew about Yaya-chan, where as she seemed to know almost everything  about me. Sure I knew small things, simple things… but the deeper  stuff that makes her act the way she does, the smiles that shine so  brightly even when she doesn’t mean it, what made her start  singing, why was she always helping me?…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had not realized I was lost in my thoughts, Amane-sempai didn’t  bother to shake me from them at the moment. And until we realized  that it was nearing sunset and our curfew that we even showed signs  of knowing that the other was beside the other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  returned to the dormitory separately… actually I don’t recall  when I started to or when we separated. I recall sighing very deeply  just as I reached our dorm room though…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  entered our room to find Yaya-chan sleeping in dusk light lit room.  She laid to her side facing my side of the wall, though I could tell  that she had originally been facing the other way from how her  blanket was ruffled and the fresh tear stains on the other side of  her pillow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Wait  a minute?!... tears?...’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan…  was crying again… and was still crying as she slept. I swear I  could hear her soft sobs in my heart, stabbing me like hot needles.  May be it was the pain of the wound this time… but if that reason  justifies these tears, what reason did she have for crying last time…  Would she tell me if I asked?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  saw the bandaged wrist, it was slightly blood stained which scared me  a little. I noticed that her notebook was open. I picked it up to  find a note for me;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>“<em>Hikari,  sorry if you were looking for me. I had an accident and cut my wrist.  I lost a bit a blood before I could get first aid, I’m feeling  slightly dizzy but the nurse said I’ll be fine. I had an early  dinner and some medicine to numb the pain. I had asked Tsubomi-chan  to fetch my bag if you haven’t already brought it with you… and  an early goodnight to you. - Yaya ”</em></u></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It’s  was a start, at least she left a message this time unlike this  morning and afternoon. I want to do something for her. I owe her a  lot, too much actually… I am not even sure if I had been of any  help to her. She might have even sacrificed her love for me…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself sitting on the side of her bed, daring myself to touch  her hand or brush her hair… neither felt easy right now. I  continued to watch her sad sleeping face, as her tears continued to  slowly flow like a gentle river. I felt so pathetic and felt like  crying myself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  can I do to stop you tears from flowing… Yaya-chan…?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  next day was… interesting... It was the only word I could describe  it with. I learned that Yaya-chan had plans today and even left  earlier than me and Amane-sempai. I had actually planned to invite  her along. After all I had heard that they weren’t able to talk,  since something happened and Yaya-chan got a cut on her wrist... I  thought of trying to get them to talk. It was something I thought of  over dinner that night, after seeing Yaya-chan on her bed yesterday  evening. They are after all the two most important people to me. I  wanted us to be close. At first I thought that there would be another  chance… Yaya-chan had always thought me to be positive about  things. I thought that it will work out somehow and decided to just  enjoy my date with Amane-sempai today.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sempai  came at my door an hour after Yaya-chan had left. She was wearing a  blue long sleeve shirt, white slacks and blue sneakers. ‘She  dresses like a guy.’ I thought, but then again that was  Amane-sempai’s charm. I blushed most of the time, realizing that I  had chosen that day of all days to wear the same colored sundress and  hat of all days. <em>‘We  looked like a pair… what will people think?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amane-sempai  on the other hand didn’t seem to mind it in the least. She was  smiling quite lively this morning… <em>‘Maybe  she had a good start this morning.’</em> I thought as I observed her. I couldn’t help but be cheered up  after seeing her reassuringly happy smile. We talked a lot on the  train, random things… some were things you say and ask when you’re  trying to find things to say and ask. I felt quite silly for a while  actually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Later  in the city, I was at a lost at what to do. I guess being stuck  inside an all girl’s school, dorm and campus for so long takes some  of you’re common sense a way. I had almost forgotten that there  males in the world. Amane-sempai then took my hand and lead the way.  We walked around the city for a while, enjoying the sights, the local  treats, peaking inside shops and restaurants. It almost felt like it  was a school fair.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lunch  time came. Sempai had suggested we eat lunch first before we continue  wandering around. I chose a café called Linden Baum. It was  close to where we had coincidentally wandered and the atmosphere  inside seems nice. We walked in and took our seats. As I was admiring  the tables and the cute uniforms for the waitresses, I noticed that  Amane-sempai was looking somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sempai?  Is everything ok?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t turn her head to look at me but answered: “Isn’t that  Nanto-san?...”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh?”  I was surprised that Yaya-chan was here. She did say that she had  plans. But she didn’t say where… did she? I turned to the  direction where Amane-sempai was looking and felt something squeeze  my heart at the sight of my best friend lying her head on  Tsubomi-chan’s shoulder. I felt envious. Thinking that I would like  to lie on Amane-sempai’s shoulder too…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  stole a glance at Amane-sempai, she looked… out of it. She had this  blank stare that held directly at Yaya-chan. I wonder if asking her  to talk to Yaya-chan wasn’t such a good idea after all. I looked at  Yaya-chan’s direction again and saw her head fall from  Tsubomi-chan’s shoulder and on to her lap.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>YAYA-CHAN!”</strong> I couldn’t hold the urge to yell her name from where I sat. But I  immediately regretted that, and tried to hide behind our menus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  took a peak and was glad that Tsubomi-chan didn’t see us. It’s  awkward enough. I looked at sempai and noticed that she was looking  at me while covering herself with her menu. She smiled at me, almost  trying to hold a laugh in. I found myself smiling, somehow the slip  up made the mood lighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  waitress then came back to take our order, we had ordered something  simple and easy to eat as well as share. I didn’t know why but it  seemed like Amane-sempai and I were planning on watching the two. We  talked and ate as we watched them, eat and be something like a sweet  couple. Yaya-chan had been feeding herself and Tsubomi-chan with the  same fork, which made me blush jealously when I heard Amane-sempai  mutter the words ‘Indirect Kisses’. They seem to be having a lot  of fun together, I was rather surprised to see Tsubomi-chan smiling  at Yaya-chan, and she usually had this big frown or pout whenever  they were in close proximity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Maybe…  Just maybe… It wasn’t Amane-sempai that Yaya-chan liked, it was  Tsubomi-chan… hmmm… but why am I wishing that it wasn’t  Tsubomi-chan either? They look good together and Yaya-chan is  smiling… Shouldn’t I be happy for her?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  inwardly sighed at my internal conflicts… why am I like this? I’m  finally alone with Amane-sempai and all I could do is think about  Yaya-chan. I found myself glancing at Amane-sempai, she was watching  Yaya and Tsubomi-chan as she slowly went thru her sandwiches. In her  eyes, I could see the same thing I was feeling… envy. I wasn’t  quite sure if she or myself were envious of them having fun and being  sweet to each other or were we... envious of Tsubomi-chan?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  didn’t realize I was staring at Amane-sempai, I instinctively let  out a soft squeak in surprise when I found sandwich softly poking my  lips. When my eyes returned to Amane-sempai, I found some calmness in  her eyes and maybe even some love… although for some reason I  didn’t want to pay to much attention to it. My eyes once again fell  on the sandwich and my hand began to rise in order to reach it only  to be stopped by her own. She looked at me, smiling as she mimicked  Yaya-chan’s “Aaaaah…” as she slowly presented the sandwich  before my lips. I swear I blushed at the sentiment before opening my  mouth to receive her offering.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somehow  all thoughts about Yaya-chan vanished for now. I had forgotten their  presence here in the same restaurant entirely. I can’t say I’m  sure that Amane-sempai is the same but at least I could see that most  of her attention was on me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  the our meal ended, we found the table Yaya-chan and Tsubomi-chan had  used earlier had been emptied and was being cleaned for it’s next  occupants. We soon left the café after Amane-sempai had paid  for our meal. I insisted on paying my half of the meal but she  insisted on paying for everything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  found ourselves wandering the city’s sights again. Amane-sempai  suggested a movie, she first pointed at the horror film that was  being advertised and I’m sure she saw all the color drain from my  face in an instant. She then apologized after a soft giggle and said  she meant to point at the romance story that was being shown beside  it. Actually I think she really wanted to watch the horror film, but  I’m just a little bit better at these things compared to  Nagisa-chan… I’m sorry Amane-sempai.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  the movie, which was very heart warming and at the same time gnawed  on my guilt and jealousy a little too much that I’d wanted, me and  sempai continued walking around. We found an ice cream stand and I  decided to purchase us a couple of Vanilla ice cream cones. Like I  did for the café she tried to pay for her cone, I had barely  managed to talk her into letting me pay after telling her that I  wouldn’t feel right if she didn’t let me pay this time and also  told her that we could take turns in paying so neither of us felt bad  about paying for each other, well it was that or we split the payment  every time. She just smiled at that and finally agreed which gave me  some relief and progress in our relationship.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a nice walk around the park we found ourselves window shopping, we  were about to enter a crafts store of sorts when we heard an  impressive tune. We followed the sound to a store two shops beside  the crafts store to find Tsubomi-chan watching… Yaya-chan playing  the Violin. I must say I was surprised… I never knew that she  played an instrument. She was really good at it too…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself walking away form the store with Amane-sempai following  beside me. She placed a hand on my shoulder and waited for me to look  at her. “Shall we call it a day?” she asked trying to keep a  smile on her face, but I knew she was worried from the tone of her  voice. All I could do was nod. We got on the train, after sempai had  purchased some bottled tea for us. I accepted the bottle she handed  to me thankfully, not worrying about the money right now, I believe  it was her turn to pay anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  a good violinist...” I heard sempai try to break the ice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“eh?”  Somehow it didn’t register quick enough in my mind, I found myself  staring at her questioningly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nanto-san,  she plays well.” Amane-sempai was leaning back on her side of the  seat, looking relaxed as she held her head up staring at the some of  the advertisements that have been placed just above our heads.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  just nodded with a soft “umn…” in response.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s  wrong Hikari?” she asked, her voice carried a tone of pure worry.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t know…” I answered honestly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Didn’t  know?” Her voice seemed to soften just as her eyes did.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  didn’t know she played the violin. I don’t remember her telling  me, nor did I bother to ask her if she did…” Tears began to form  in my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was really bothering me now. Who did she like? What does she like?  What does she dislike? What’s her favorite color? What’s her  favorite food? When did she start singing? Why did she choose me as  her roommate? What are her other hobbies? What doesn’t she know  about me? So many how, what, where, when and who came dashing in my  mind. Each brought more and more questions… Where Yaya-chan seemed  to know so much about me, I’ve barely touch the surface of the  enigma that is Nanto Yaya.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  rode in silence most of the way. I was depressed right now.  Amane-sempai seemed to have noticed it and just took my hand in one  of hers and gently patted it, which seemed to calm me a little. She  didn’t say anything, I wasn’t sure if she understood my pain or  couldn’t find the words to use to cheer my up like Yaya-chan does.  But that was alright; <em>‘Amane-sempai  is Amane-sempai, Yaya-chan is Yaya-chan.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  was glad the train was empty, especially in the last car which we  rode. I didn’t notice it earlier but she had also been drying my  tears for me. She allowed me to rest my head on her shoulder, I found  myself slowly drifting to a light sleep.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  I woke up, the train had already gone to a complete stop. It would  stay in this station for a few minutes which meant none of the  passengers, getting on or getting off had to worry about not making  it on time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did  you have a good nap?” Amane-sempai asked me with a soft gentle  smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">To  which I answered with a nod and a smile of my own. She led us off the  empty train, the batch new passengers were just beginning to get on.  I found myself pondering on sempai’s recent words… <em>“Did  you have a good nap…?”</em> her voice replayed in my head once more. Only to be replaced by  Yaya-chan’s own… a memory of a day we sat outside under the shade  of a tree. It was a good memory…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">We  had a picnic one Sunday morning and I had found myself feeling sleepy  after singing, walking with her around the lake and a nice simple  picnic meal that we made together. She had told me to rest for a  while before we went back to the dorm as it was too early and the  warm sun and the cool breeze just felt to good to waste indoors, when  I woke up I found myself laying on her lap as and her eyes gently  staring down at me with a smile on her lips, and now that I think  about it… her smile is very lovely. She brushed off a few stray  hairs that threatened to poke my eyes before she greeted me with her  cheerful voice and asked me <em>“Did  you have a good nap. Hikari?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hikari?”  Amane-sempai’s voice snapped me out of my daydream.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?...”  I asked softly, blushing that I had been strangely out of it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  just smiled and turned towards the path to our dorms then pointed  somewhere there. I turned to look and noticed a familiar, red capped  raven haired girl beside a very pink clad shorter girl, that I’m  sure was unmistakably Yaya-chan and Tsubomi-chan.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Neither  of us seemed to want to walk up to them and talk. We unconsciously  agreed to follow and watch them from afar. When they reached near the  dorm gates, they stopped for a bit and so did we. I’m sure  Yaya-chan would recognize me at a glance so I decided to hide behind  some a tree. We watched Yaya-chan write something on her note book  and show it to Tsubomi-chan, who blushed and nodded. I wonder what  was written on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan  then placed her notebook in the bag she carried and then gently  cupped Tsubomi-chan’s blushing face. ‘Is she going to kiss her?!’  I thought. It seemed so possible, especially after… I shrugged off  the memory of my first kiss… and watched, hoped and prayed she  wasn’t going to… I found myself clutching the fabric above my  heart tightly, as a pang of emotions threatened to squeeze my breath  away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  were still for a few moments… which didn’t last too long.  Yaya-chan then resumed closing the gap between them. I looked away…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>NO!  Please! NO!’ </em> What am I  saying? Shouldn’t I be supporting her at times like these? What’s  wrong with me…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  then heard an audible sigh of relief coming from Amane-sempai. I  turned to her, to see that she looked relieved about something. I  turned my attention back to Yaya-chan and Tsubomi-chan., my  unreasoned wish seems to have been granted as I had hoped very  strongly that they did not kiss. What I saw instead still surprised  me, but relieved me as well. Yaya-chan had placed her arms around  Tsubomi-chan’s neck, locking her into a tight hug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself realizing a breath of relief and slowly sat myself on  the soft green grass under the tree. I heard the grass beside me  rustling and I soon found my neck in between and wrapped with  Amane-sempai’s arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry. I kind of got jealous of them, being so close to each other.”  She said, blushing as she gazed at me with her soft eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  soon found myself blushing as well. I had to gather up most of my  shyness and shove it in a locker in my mind just so I could bring  myself to wrap my own arms around her as well. “Me too…” I  could feel her smile from the side of my own cheek. I guess our date  wasn’t entirely ruined.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a few minutes in each other’s arms we rose and were glad to find  that Yaya-chan and Tsubomi-chan were no longer where they once stood.  We entered the dorm and slowly parted, saying our soft goodbyes  hopefully none of the other students saw us together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  headed back to our room. But I decided not to hurry at all. <em>‘I  should probably give her enough time to change or something. Or she  might think I was following her…’</em> It took me around 10 minutes to get to our room, when it usually took  no more than 3 minutes to get there even when one was just walking.  Oh well… I did after all had decided to wander around the ground  floor first before heading up to our floor.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  I got to our room, I was a bit disappointed that Yaya-chan wasn’t  there waiting to greet me. Then again she probably didn’t expect me  home so early. She was inside our bathroom, taking a shower. I was  about to knock and say that I was home, but when I saw the notebook  she used a just a few minutes ago on her table the routine just faded  out of me. Without really thinking about it, I found myself picking  the notebook up and flipping to a few random pages.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Honestly…  I didn’t like what I saw… it was colorful page with a drawing of  herself and Tsubomi-chan, with the lines <em><u>“Let’s  go on a date!”</u></em> I  didn’t know what to think or what I should feel. A few pages later,  I found out that Yaya-chan was actually taking herself to the  hospital and asked Tsubomi-chan to accompany her. I randomly turned  pages back and forth. A lot of Yaya like responses that made me  smile… and a few not the did not seem the least bit like Yaya-chan  that I knew and … <em>‘knew  and what?...’</em> … I  sighed at my internal self conflict. <em>‘Should  I dare I say love?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  if they were just going to the hospital, why were they out having  fun… I found myself answering that question, I mean it was really  silly of me to ask… I would have done the same so long as I wasn’t  busy. They were already in town after all why waste the trip… I  guess…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">My  thoughts was soon brought to a screeching halt as the water from the  shower suddenly stopped. I hurriedly returned the notebook just as I  had found it. I then opened the door loudly that it creaked. “I’m  back!” I call out cheerfully… at least as cheerful as I could  manage before closing the door once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yaya-chan  then came out of the bathroom, her hair was wrapped in her towel she  hand already change into something to she could sleep in. She smiled  and waved as she looked at me. I don’t think I can ever tell her  than I read her earlier conversations. She sat on her bed and picked  up her notebook, for a second I thought she found out that I had read  her notebook, especially when she began writing something. I thought  that she was going to scold me right then and there. But to my relief  she just welcomed me back to our room and asked about my day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  had pretty much glossed over today’s events. I had paid extra  attention so as not to mention the places that we had spotted her and  Tsubomi-chan. I could tell that she was a little nervous about it as  well like she feared that I’d mention seeing her there. I decided  not to mention it for now. After all there wasn’t really a good  reason for me to… not for now anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  some small talk and short written conversations on her part, she  decided to get her homework done so that she could finally catch up  and be up to date with the rest of the class. I made some tea for her  while she worked which I served along with some sweet butter  biscuits. She happily thanked me, noting that she needed something to  hold her while we waited for dinner time.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  found myself watching her a lot, the way her eyes lazily gazed at her  books as she studied, the way that her lips curled as she would sip  her tea, the way she nibbled on each biscuit, the way she very lady  like sniffled a bored yawn, the elegant strokes of her pen, the  gentle and curious way she stared at me… <em>‘what?  oh my…’</em> I didn’t  realized it, I had been staring at her for so long that she caught  me. A very familiar smile of mischief crept up of her lips… the  very smile that cause countless moments of embarrassments and blushes  was now of all times oddly a welcome sight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  had opened her notebook again, and wrote; <em><u>“Hikari…  why are you staring at me?”</u></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…  uhh… umm…” I couldn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>“<em>You  have Otori-sama now. She’s pretty big catch, you most likely  wouldn’t need to cheat. But if you did you really shouldn’t go  for someone like me.”</em></u> She quickly wrote and showed me. Her smile weakened… I knew that  much without looking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I  didn’t know how but I lost it somehow the words cheat and what she  called Amane-sempai didn’t even register in my mind. It pained me  when I read the last sentence, she was demeaning herself, sure it  wasn’t all there but I knew she was trying to telling me that she  wasn’t special. And before I could really think about it… I said;  “How can you say that! Yaya-chan you’re special to me too!  You’re… you’re…” the mischief in her smile faded, the smile  itself was gone for a few moments, before being replaced by one that  I knew deep inside was genuine. It wasn’t a big smile, it wasn’t  bright, but it was Yaya-chan’s real smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><u>“<em>Thank  you… Hikari.”</em></u> She  quickly noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  like that all use for words seemed to have vanished. I found myself  throwing myself at Yaya-chan, she dropped her notebook onto the floor  in her surprise. I hugged her tightly by her waist while I laying my  head on her slim abdomen. Tears of mixed emotions just streamed from  my eyes, I tried my best at holding them back. But she didn’t seem  to mind. I could feel her gentle hand brushing my hair, just like she  had done so many times before. I slowly gave in to my tears. I was  happy; being here in her arms and the question why did not matter to  me right now. I was. And for now that was enough…</span></p>
