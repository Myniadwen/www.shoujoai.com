<p>“Hey. Hey, hey! Get up, you lazy girl.”</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi groaned as someone stripped her blankets away, hugging her own body tightly. “Cold…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. Just get up, already. This isn’t a good day to be late up.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  could be a little more kind, you know.” Momomi sat up and pushed her  hair out of her eyes, slightly amused to see Kaname firmly facing the  wall. <em>That’s good, I think. I want her notice when I’m half-naked. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you ever kind?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well. I’m never so cruel on such a cold morning…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not going to get warmer if you stay in the blankets, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know,” Momomi replied, smirking and wrapping her arms round her knees.  “I was hoping you could pass me my clothes so I could change beneath  the covers, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What am I, your mother? I’m not going to spoil you, you know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  Too bad. I wouldn’t mind being spoiled from time to time.” Momomi stood  and brushed herself off, putting a hand on her hip casually. “Now, you  go and wash yourself. I’ll pick out your clothes, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can do that myself, you know,” Kaname grumbled, glancing over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. I have a better eye for it. Besides, it’ll make me happy.” Momomi grinned. “Let me do this for you, for me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  doesn’t even make sense… but whatever.” Kaname flushed and turned away.  “Don’t dress me in anything stupid. And no skirts, okay. I don’t do  skirts.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t even buy any for you,” Momomi teased. “You’re  right. You don’t do skirts.” She watched her girlfriend walk away,  tapping her cheek thoughtfully with her free hand. <em>Is it perverted  to think that she looks good in just her underclothes? Not in a sexual  way, but the intimacy of it…the way she’s so ruffled and raw and  herself, unguarded, just after she gets up… and that’s something she  isn’t afraid to show me, even though she knows I look on her as more  than a friend…or something. I don’t know. </em>She cocked her head, smiling gently. <em>I like it anyway. When she’s so bashful and embarrassed, that probably makes me a bad person. </em>She  dismissed the thought, walking over to their much-expanded wardrobe and  flicking through a few of the hangers on Kaname’s side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This  would be a lot easier if I had a better idea of the program…oh, well.  Just something that goes well with anything, I suppose. And something  warm. Don’t forget that. </em>She ended up picking out jeans, a  long-sleeved shirt and a dark blue hoodie, folding them neatly and  placing them on Kaname’s bed. For herself, leggings, a knee-length  white skirt, a white blouse and a crème-coloured jumper. She stuck  those under her arm and picked up her comb from the table, waiting for  Kaname to come out. <em>I guess that makes me the ‘girl’ in our  relationship… no surprises there. It’s just funny that I’m the one who  always takes the initiative, when that’s the case. I suppose the moral  of the story is that gender roles mean nothing when the ‘man’ has no  balls. Literally and figuratively. I don’t think I have the patience or  inclination to conform to my role. It’s more fun to make Kaname just a  little embarrassed, but going along with things all the same…when I  went through the stress of the first confession, I think I deserve the  subsequent teasing. It makes things more fun. And I’m sure Kaname likes  it too, even if she’d never actually admit that to me. She’s not very  honest…</em>Momomi smiled. <em>In that respect, too, she’s very like stereotype’s man, though she’d hate it if I told her that. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname came out, frowning at her. “Not dressed yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shush.  Just get dressed yourself.” Momomi prodded her on the shoulder as she  walked past. “And don’t come in here under any circumstances, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Sure. Whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  wondered whether she had imagined eyes following her every movement as  she walked in and closed the door. She didn’t move her head to check. <em>After  all, the girl should play cool. No, I’m not playing by those rules, am  I? But I’ll stay cool, all the same, until I find an entertaining  moment to unbalance her. This will be done my way, and it won’t be  boring, either…I wonder whether Kaname knows exactly what she’s let  herself in for? </em>She placed her clothes in the corner of the bathroom and started to wash her face.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, what’s the program?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi poured herself a glass of water. “I’m not sure. Do you have any ideas?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope. I’d kinda presumed that you’d have it all figured out. You’re the forwards-planner, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I didn’t plan.” Momomi took out her toothbrush and applied paste. “How  about you? You’re the spontaneous one, and that’s the situation we’re  in right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,” Kaname said guardedly. “I could  come up with something. But we should sort out the financial thing  first. You know we’d only argue about it afterwards if we don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Talking  it out now, is it?” Momomi asked. “That almost feels too mature for us.  We normally just leave it until the last moment then have a shouting  contest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A chuckle. “Well, this is what couples do, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mature  couples,” Momomi corrected. “At our age, we’re supposed to have  shouting contests, break up after two weeks and then angst for about a  month about how our life has ended and no one understands are pain.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well. I’ve never been keen on stereotypes, you know. Let’s try for a little more than that, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, I agree. But how far things go, that’s your call, though.” Momomi  smiled. “We had a pretty stereotypical start, so I’m hoping for a less  cliché continuation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll see. But that’s not the point. The way I see it, I should pay for today. You paid for the last time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With my parents money, which I’m glad to waste,” Momomi pointed out. “I still have some left, burning a hole in my conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so. It’s your money. You can’t expect me to just sit back and do nothing, you know. I still owe you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not bothered. You don’t owe me anything.” Momomi sighed. “Seriously.  Besides, isn’t it more fun to splurge on our first few dates?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have my pride, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your pride is so difficult.” Momomi sighed. “Fine. Fifty-fifty?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you. I owe you for last time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well. You don’t have much in the way of spending money, so I don’t want  you using your lunch money out of pride. I’m the same, considering I  won’t go begging to my parents. We might as well spend the money we do  have first…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A sigh. “Well, I know that. But still… I’m not going  to be the kind of person who coasts on the richer partner’s money, you  know. I’m not ever going to be that kind of person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know  that, you idiot,” Momomi said affectionately. “You’re too proud. How  about this… I’ll pay for now, and you can keep track of the number of  times that happens. After that, you can treat me to an equal number  when I’m through.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine… but I’ll be holding you to that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. I will hold you to your promises, you know.” Momomi smiled.  “Now shut up and let me finish up here, okay? Stop distracting me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  the dates you’ll be paying for will have to be fairly modest affairs.  I’d better make sure we spend less time to break her into it. Well, it  only matters if we last that long…</em>Momomi shook her head. <em>I can’t  think like that. I don’t know how this will go, but I need to believe  that it will last. If I can’t do that even this early, we really will  be screwed.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She cleaned her teeth then dressed quickly,  letting everything fall into place. It felt strangely liberating to be  wearing something, anything but Spica’s school uniform. After that she  brushed her hair, working out all the tangles. She frowned at the  mirror and turned her comb back and forth, trying to work out exactly  where to brush to add the final touches. After a while, she gave up,  putting the comb down and looking at her reflection in the mirror. <em>Not  bad. Not the face that launched a thousand ships, but I think I could  put the wind in the sails of a frigate or two, which is about all you  can expected of someone my age. </em>She cocked her head, running a hand through her hair one last time before walking out the door. “Okay, I’m done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You took your sweet time, didn’t you?” Kaname was in her cool-girl pose, opening her eyes and looking up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry. But I’m a perfectionist.” Momomi swept her eyes over her friend. “As I expected, you look good in that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thanks,” Kaname replied, flushing slightly. “You too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I chose the clothes, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smiled. “You’re arrogant, aren’t you? It’s more the fact that you’re wearing the clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  felt her insides twist slightly. It wasn’t an unpleasant sensation.  “Was that a compliment from you?” she asked, covering herself. “I’m  amazed…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not particularly. Choosing clothes is a skill, but good looks is a matter of chance. Not something you earned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed. “Now, now, Kaname… you should never say that to a lady. They  get annoyed, because they struggle and toil for hours every day to  achieve those good looks you blithely dismiss as chance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well. That may be so. But you don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Well, I suppose so. But now you can’t expect me to do so in future, now can you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed. “I guess so. I’m going to regret those words when you come out in rashes and spots as a teen, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, come on. Being a teenager has bad karma as it is,” Momomi scoffed. “I don’t need you jinxing things for me even further.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry.  I wonder whether that’ll happen to you, though…” Kaname frowned. “I  mean, it’s hard to imagine that could ever have happened to the  Etoiles, for example.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder. But it wouldn’t surprise me, as  such…” Momomi grinned. “Cygnets become swans, after all. Don’t write  anyone off too soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Not even Shion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not even Shion.” Momomi frowned thoughtfully. “Well, except for the forehead. She’s probably stuck with that for good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re so unkind to her. And if it’s me saying that, things really are bad…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  a tough girl, she can take. To be honest, I think she enjoys the  attention.” Momomi opened the wardrobe again, taking out their coats.  “Here. I’m sure it’ll be cold out.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re probably right.”  Kaname caught the coat and shrugged it on. “Honestly, snow at Christmas  or the feverish summertime… those are the best times for romance,  right? Not the miserable spiral of autumn into winter.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? You  make it sound like you’re the one who reads my books.” Momomi shrugged  her coat on and opened the door. “Come on. Let’s get out of here before  Shion catches us and drags us into something…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m more worried about her stalking us. I swear she was in those bushes…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought something similar, but I’m sure we’re being paranoid.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s just what she wants you to think,” Kaname warned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  giggled. “Yes, yes. And she doesn’t want us to know she’s a ninja from  an ancient clan, either. Come on, let’s go.” She walked out the door.  “Now, let’s do our last minute planning. What do we want to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tennis?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’d murder me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay… swimming?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Nice try. How about something that actually involves leaving the school?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  pool’s reserved for the swimming team. But there is a leisure centre on  the far side of time. I’ve been there a few times.” Kaname frowned.  “Though we haven’t brought our swimming stuff…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly, do you  expect me to go on a date in the school swimsuits?” Momomi frowned.  “No, wait… we can go shopping for swimsuits, and then go swimming! How  about that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, god. You mean more clothes shopping?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  clothes shopping, bikini shopping! Completely different!” Momomi  grinned. “Besides, swimming is more your kind of thing. This way it’s  fairer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aren’t we a bit young for this kind of thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s no such thing. Call this practise for when we’re older!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  laughed. “Practise, eh? You know, that’s what my mother would call  this, after she’d stopped being disgusted. Girl-girl romance as a dress  rehearsal for real relationships, that’s a common concept here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  those kind of attitudes are correct, I’m going to feel pretty stupid,  aren’t I?” Momomi laughed. “I don’t think so, though. Either way, we  might as well have fun.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.” Kaname glanced at her. “You can swim, right!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  I can, damnit.” Momomi pouted. “We have a twenty-five meter indoor pool  at home, you know. Mostly for having, my family aren’t big at swimming  either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “What a luxurious attitude… I would have  killed for one at home. Literally. I loved it when I got to go, but  those occasions were few and far between.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. My family are  rich bastards, right enough.” Momomi nodded. “Shopping then swimming,  though. It’s settled. We’ll have to eat, though. Shall we have  breakfast in the canteen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shook her head. “I think it’d be better if we ate in town.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at her. “Okay, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname was looking elsewhere, silent for a few moments.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned, watching her trade girls with some first years. “What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Say, yesterday, did you get any… attention, from people.” Kaname shrugged. “You know, Amane-fangirl types.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  right… yeah. A bit. Staring and stuff.” Momomi laughed. “And this one  girl came up to me in the corridor and told me I was a dirty slut who  didn’t deserve Amane-sama’s attention. Her words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” Kaname snapped. “She said that? Who? I’ll bloody kill her for-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi put a hand on her arm, smiling. “Let me finish. I was going to say, so I laughed all the way to Geography.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so, no one has the right to talk to you like that.” Kaname snorted. “She’ll pay for that. That’s part of my pride, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  stuff your pride, you big oaf,” Momomi said affectionately. “I told  you, it doesn’t worry me. This stuff will blow over after a while. I’ve  been called worse on a daily basis, back in the day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By me,” Kaname noted, smiling at the memory.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I was going to say by my father. But you, too.” Momomi shrugged. “Well,  it’s kinda annoying, but I’m thick-skinned. In a way, it’s flattery. It  shows that people want to be me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well. That’s annoying as  well.” Kaname sighed. “It’s all Amane’s fault. If she hadn’t done  something so unnecessary, we wouldn’t have to deal with this crap.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s fine,” Momomi said. “Amane can do what she likes, and we will too. We don’t care what these people say, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. But still-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you really that bothered by the crowds?” Momomi teased. “You’re more sensitive than even I’d suspected…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  cool with it,” Kaname replied firmly. “I could care less. But you’ll  have it worse, and if you do get upset, I will hold people responsible.  Whoever did it, and Amane too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I let Amane do this, you know,” Momomi pointed out. “I can make my own decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so, she should be more careful…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bear responsibility.” Momomi folded her arms. “I’m smart enough to know what I’m doing, okay? So leave Amane out of this.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname looked at her, then shrugged. “Fine. If you insist. But don’t expect me to just take it if things get worse, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They’ll  get better. People have short attention spans, they’ll get bored  eventually.” Momomi spoke with more confidence than she felt. <em>I  hope so, anyway. If things do get worse before they get better, and  they get bad enough for Kaname to get angry, it’d be a problem. </em>“But I suppose there’s no point in telling you not to hurt anyone?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No point at all,” Kaname grunted. “That’s not negotiable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I thought so.” Momomi sighed. “You’re very troublesome, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is the one way I’ll spoil you. Enjoy it.” Kaname smiled at her. “After all, you can’t defend yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so,” Momomi agreed, smiling back. <em>But I suppose I wouldn’t change things even if I could. It’s her kind of caring, and I appreciate it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  took them some time to get to town, talking about nothing in  particular. The main recurring topic with Amane, who came up so much  that Momomi wasn’t quite sure whether she should be flattered of  Kaname’s jealousy or jealous herself. But that doesn’t bother me too  much. <em>More importantly, I’m in Kaname’s company again, aiming to  have a fun day with her, and this time we have the all-important couple  status. Mostly. I’m not going to think too hard about the caveats and  problems and weaknesses and everything else right now. I’m not in the  mood. Right now, all we have to is enjoy things, and let things come as  they come. That, in itself, is a luxury I intend to relish. </em>She watched Kaname, smiling. <em>She  really is quite beautiful, in a rough-edged kind of way. I’m amazed no  one else tried to date her, but I guess her personality was quite the  obstacle to most people. It surprises me that no one can see past her  façade and notice just how vulnerable she really is. To be honest, it’s  not the best façade ever. But I suppose no one thought to look that  close, in the same way I haven’t bothered to look at most of them. How  I despair of mankind…but it can’t be helped. No, this is good in a way.  I get her all to myself.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s up?” Kaname asked, glancing at her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shook her head innocently. “Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They stepped into the town proper. Momomi looked around then took Kaname’s arm in her own, smirking.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you think?” Momomi asked. “I’m making sure everyone knows that you’re my Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s rather the problem…” Kaname sighed as she gripped tighter. “Don’t you find it awkward?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really. You know how I am.” Momomi sighed. “I’ll stop if you insist, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.  It’s alright.” Kaname flushed slightly then recovered her poise. “Oh,  well. I’m sure this town has seen a lot worse in its time…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bet,” Momomi agreed. “I’d do this anywhere, though. It’s not like I’m ashamed of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well. Pride is good. It’s just that it’ll get you stabbed in some  places.” Kaname sighed deeply. “This isn’t an ideal world.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’ll worry about that when it becomes relevent.” Momomi shrugged.  “Besides, this could be construed as platonic. Just about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well. People aren’t very charitably minded…” Kaname laughed. “I wonder  what they’d all say, if they heard that I was dating another girl. All  those nutjobs back home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More or less the same thing my family would say if they knew,” Momomi replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  My lot would be less eloquent, though. But they’d both be violent.”  Kaname shook her head. “When you think about it, speaking purely  subjectively, it isn’t easy to live like this, is it? Society is a  pretty static thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, neither of us are good at easy, are  we?” Momomi smiled. “But it’s not like you to talk like that. You  should know how pointless it is to dwell on the what-ifs. For me, at  least, this-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“-is who I am,” Kaname finished. “I know. But I’ve  come a long way from where I came from. I suppose that was the point of  coming here at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you going to do? When you graduate, or whatever?” Momomi asked curiously. “Go back there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  for preference. But I don’t know. I don’t think so far ahead, but I do  know that places like that have a gravity to them. Dragging you in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? You’ve always made it sound like more of a repulsive force…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  a gravity of the mind, because it gets into your head. In the end,  you’re trapped in that kind of life. That’s why equality of opportunity  will always be a joke, I guess.” Kaname shrugged. “People’s minds are  difficult to deal with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you managed to come here, didn’t you? Isn’t that a good example of upward mobility?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Somewhat.  But I didn’t do well here, for a variety of reasons… but one of them  was the kind of person I am.” Kaname looked away thoughtfully. “I’m not  absolving myself of responsibility. But still, my there and your there  are pretty different.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The main thing in common being the fact  that both of us want to be here, not there.” Momomi chuckled sadly.  “Quite the pair, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Well, we should probably talk about happier things.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  went to a different café this time, eating a quick and cheap western  breakfast. Momomi was saddened by the loss of a good chance to feed  Kaname, but there was always lunchtime. <em>And every other lunchtime ever, more or less. If nothing else, she can motivate me to study…</em>She  settled for toying with Kaname’s hand after they’d finished eating,  rubbing her thumb over the knuckles and watching the girl blush. <em>I  guess this is a kind of studying too. Working out what’s fun to do,  what works, where the lines are…I guess that’s the point of being a  couple. It makes a lot more possible. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t look like we’re the only ones here from Astraea,” Kaname observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked around and nodded. “Yeah. Well, it makes sense, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wonder how many are couples, how many are friends, and how many are friends pretending to be couples…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As cynical as ever, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, I’m just telling it the way it is,” Kaname replied. “Let’s face it, the Etoiles kinda started a trend.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It seems like an odd thing to fake…” Momomi murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know how people are. I’ll bet you half of these girls will be in normal marriages by the end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kaname too?” Momomi asked teasingly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows?” Kaname smirked. “As far as I can tell, for my big dramatic this-is-who-I-am, I can play for both teams.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s pretty convenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  bloody weird, but I guess I’m not complaining now I’ve got the hang of  it.” Kaname smiled. “But yeah. My options are open. I don’t see myself  as the marriage kind of person, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll bet. You’d make a terrible wife.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, thanks… you, on the other hand, would make a great wife. If it wasn’t for one small particular, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  laughed. “Well, quite. I’d be a great wife to a guy who didn’t expect  me to do anything for him, with him or on his behalf.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think even I’m a great wife under those conditions…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess so.” Momomi made a face. “Let’s see… Kariya? Serané?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One  would commit homicide and the other would… hmm… I’m not sure.” Kaname  frowned. “Perhaps have a bunch of affairs with the maids. She wouldn’t  take it lying down… except with girls.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled. “My, my. You have a dirty side, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  yeah. I’m a teenager, too.” Kaname grinned. “But still, it is a funny  thought. Somehow, I can’t imagine those two being domesticated. They’re  too, well, too them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know. It’s a little encouraging.” Momomi smiled. “That’s why they’re called the Etoiles, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I suppose so. I don’t put much stock by that stuff, though. If you ask me, people find their own stars.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smiled. “Quite the romantic, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled and rooted through her purse, taking out the money necessary  to pay. “In any case, we’d better get on. Do you want to swim before or  after lunch?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Before, I guess. They say you shouldn’t eat on a full stomach, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stood and put her coat on. “You’re right. That’s as good a reason as any for going, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right.” Kaname followed suit, walking round the table and taking Momomi’s arm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked and glanced up at her, but Kaname just shrugged and started to walk. Momomi smiled and walked beside her. <em>She’s warm. It’s a good feeling. She’s strong, too, or stronger than me anyway. It’s a comforting thing.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, how long is this shopping thing going to take?” Kaname demanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi shrugged. “Who knows? That depends on how long it takes to find the right thing…” <em>And  those red eyes, too. I don’t know who has red eyes, but she does. I  like it. It suits her, dangerous but strong. They suit her when she’s  filled with resolve, but the blood turns to water when she’s wrapped in  the wavering uncertainty that’s very much her. And now I can look her  in the eyes, too, and I don’t have to be afraid.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine. Don’t be too much of a perfectionist, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry. There’s not much chance of anything being perfect on you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname laughed. “The same to you, but I take your point. Don’t forget it, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll remember. I could hardly forget.” Momomi grinned. <em>And her laugh, too. She doesn’t laugh a lot, but that just makes it more pleasant when she does hear it. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And remember, this is my favour to you, okay? I still don’t like clothes shopping. That hasn’t changed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All the more reason for me to work on that,” Momomi replied. “Couples are supposed to share their interests, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That doesn’t mean you can walk over me, either! Sharing means more than making me play dress-up, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right. I’m sorry.” Momomi closed her eyes. “So how about you choose mine, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What? That doesn’t even make sense… shouldn’t we choose our own?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s boring. Besides, everyone knows that this stuff is selected for other people, not yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s what I’m worried about. I don’t want to know what you’ll be forcing on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, don’t worry. It’ll be decent. I don’t want anyone staring too hard at my Kaname, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How fast the possessives slip in to conversation…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The same way you talk about protecting me, you mean?” Momomi teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname smirked and shrugged, closing her eyes. “I guess so. It can’t be helped, now can it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. I like it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  walked into the nearest clothes store. Momomi lead the way with some  confidence, threading her way through the aisles and arriving in the  enlarged girlswear’s section. However, while there was plenty in the  way of underwear swimsuits were distinctly on the thin side. To the  point of absence. Momomi looked around with increasing desperation,  then sighed and stuck her hands in her pockets. “Okay. I should have  thought of that earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “Well, I didn’t either, if that’s any consolation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Winter  and swimming costumes don’t go together, I guess. This is the fault of  our unromantic timing, like you mentioned earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, we can try another store.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess so,” Momomi agreed half-heartedly. She turned and headed out.  “But still, this is a definite argument in favour of forwards-planning,  don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It could be worse,” Kaname replied diplomatically. “Well, from my perspective, things could have gone according to plan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed weakly. “All the same, that’s quite a screw-up for our first proper date, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  think that’s a good sign. Serané talked about these things.” Kaname  frowned. “Something about how a bad date is always from a safe pair of  hands. The worse can of man always has it well organised, after all.  Well, I guess a bad date as a result of a second girlfriend turning up  is the exception to that rule…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that a danger for us?” Momomi asked, smiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Only  if Amane shows.” Kaname winced as Momomi punched her casually on the  shoulder. “Ouch. This is why you’re in no danger from me, you know. One  girl is more than I can handle, forget two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “Don’t make me sound too horrible… but what are we going to do now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows?” Kaname shrugged. “Well, I’m getting tired of standing up. So let’s rest at the park, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright.” Momomi flushed and smiled. “Really… what is it they say about best-laid plans?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We invent plans to discard them,” Kaname replied easily. “We’ve done it before, and we’ll do it again, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds very… unreliable.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yeah. But aren’t things more fun that way?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  ended up side by side on a park bench, looking at each other under a  cold wind. Momomi felt her lips quirk into a smile. “Well, here we are…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, I’m still surprised.” Momomi’s gaze dropped a little. “When I  first realised that I had feelings for you, I never dared imagine that  they’d be returned…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When I found out you had feelings for you,  I never dared imagine that I’d be able to return them.” Kaname shrugged  and smiled. “I think the lesson to take home from all this is that  we’re less smart than we like to think.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or that common sense is  indeed anything but,” Momomi agreed. “Still, though… things have  changed very fast. It’s hard to believe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s how people  work. We’re an adaptive species. We can get used to almost anything.”  Kaname sighed. “Well, I guess we should know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Accepting the  bad, failing to appreciate the good, all that. I know what you mean.”  Momomi ran a finger down her chin thoughtfully. “Romance is odd because  it can break that. By all accounts, people our age can lose all sense  of proportions over this stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname glanced at her seriously.  “Sometimes I think it’d be fun to feel like that, when times are good.  But stable emotions are better, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Well, you’re  not very stable at the best of times…” Momomi smiled nervously. This  was a bad time to realise that Kaname’s face was very close, her eyes  very serious.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you any different?” Kaname leaned forwards and  prodded Momomi on the nose. “That’s what I like about you. We’re  different and similar at the same time. Interesting and relaxing. That  should be a contradiction, but it isn’t. Somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  chuckled. “Somehow… you’re right, of course. I get the sense that this  shouldn’t work, that it isn’t meant to work, but somehow it does.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  stared into each other’s eyes for a moment, both acutely aware of an  increasingly awkward atmosphere. “It really is cold out,” Kaname  murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re right,” Momomi replied distractedly. Her gaze  dropped slightly, focusing on Kaname’s lips. She remembered herself and  looked up again. “I’m glad we brought coats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  looked equally distracted. Momomi tried to find something to say. “You  know… I’ve always wondered, if you were looking for something in life,  one thing, what would it be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned slightly, her smooth lips contracting. “You mean my purpose in life? Something like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess so.” Momomi shrugged and smiled awkwardly. The red eyes were  intense, marbles running with blood. “You know, I’ve never really  believed in a meaning of life, but people live in a certain way, aiming  for something or other- unless that’s just me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Kaname nodded slightly. “I know what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  me, well, I’m not sure.” Pale skin, red eyes, seashell pink lips… “I  guess it’d be freedom,” Momomi said hurriedly. “Of a kind. I always  wanted to know something or have something or believe in something that  wasn’t forced on me.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just nodded again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s not a  matter of guilt,” Momomi explained. “Nothing like misplaced nobility.  The poor won’t be fed if I starve myself. But for me, as a child, and  it’s a childish thing, I did want that. I still want that. To be able  to touch something and say this is mine, and mine alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There are worse aspirations,” Kaname observed quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For  me, it was something similar.” Those red eyes transfixed her. “Never  something I thought too hard about, never something I’d admit, but even  when I came here, in a way that was to make a distance from the past.”  Kaname smiled gently. “We must be quite weird, to think that way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably,” Momomi agreed. <em>It’s like an enchantment.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  a sense of belonging, after that. Even when I had independent things  here, it didn’t mean anything. Until you came and believed in me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No. That’s wrong. I want to fall under this spell…so I’ll let myself fall into its warm embrace. </em>“Kaname…”  Momomi tried to find the words, then gave up. Her face was too close,  her breath too warm, they were to completely alone in this little  corner of the park where no one watched or stirred. “Do you want to try  it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just nodded, leaning forwards slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  leaned in as well, heart racing. Her hair was getting in her face so  she pulled it from her eyes with one hand. She had to twist her spine  awkwardly and lean across her own body, and she wasn’t quite sure  whether you were supposed to close your eyes before or after you’d made  contact. Presumably the latter, otherwise you’d miss. Even as it was,  it was difficult to align herself with a taller Kaname, especially with  the other girl coming closer as well. Blood was pounding through her  ears, setting her skin on fire. Her breath came faster and her whole  body felt like it was just short of shock. And somehow, on some level,  she couldn’t believe that she was doing this. Their noses bumped  together awkwardly, their faces not quite fitting. Momomi raised her  other hand and steadied Kaname’s cheek, their lips meeting clumsily. It  was a brief, tentative touch, uncertain and ephemeral, like a blossom  of frost. Something so barely tangible and there that you wondered  whether it had ever been. All the same, for a single moment, she swore  her heart stopped beating, or else beat so fast it whined.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She pulled away, rubbing her nose and smiling awkwardly. “Well, that was… I enjoyed it, though…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname was breathing fast, her face flushed, her eyes soft as coral. “Yeah. Me too…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi wondered whether she looked so raw and vulnerable. “Feels like we have a way to go, though… want to try again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded mutely, placing a hand on Momomi’s cheek. They leaned in once more.</span></p>
