~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last Love Letter

      Sakuragi Kaori would not die with any regrets.  She had loved, and 
she had been loved. 

      So had Shizuma, and she was going to live on long after Kaori.  
Kaori&#39;s death was going to pain Shizuma greatly, and it could cause the 
older girl to close off her heart to any new love. 

      Kaori was not going to let that happen.  Otherwise, she would not 
be able to rest in peace. 

      She laid her hand on the window of her dorm room.  She was several 
stories up, and thus could easily see many other happy students under 
the bright blue sky.  The girls of the Strawberry Dorms could love so 
much, and that helped settle Kaori&#39;s heart. 

      Three beautiful schools with many, many beautiful students.  Kaori 
was so thankful that she had the chance to attend Miator and become 
close to Miyuki and Shizuma.  She truly loved them both, each in a 
different way. 

      Kaori went over to her desk and sat down.  From the top drawer she 
pulled out a pen and a piece of paper.  No letter would be able to truly 
convey her feelings, but this would help Shizuma overcome her grief. 

      Slowly, Kaori placed the pen over the paper and began writing.  At 
first she had been worried that she wouldn&#39;t know what to write, but 
once she actually started, every word came naturally.  That was good, 
she thought; this letter had to be honest as possible. 

      The door opened, and Shizuma stepped in.  Kaori hastily turned 
over the piece of paper as Shizuma came up behind her.  &quot;Oh, what are 
you working on?&quot; the older girl asked as she wrapped her arms around the 
younger girl&#39;s small shoulders.  Shizuma smelt kind of like 
strawberries, Kaori noticed. 

      &quot;Something important,&quot; Kaori answered with a smile.  &quot;It&#39;s a 
secret for now.&quot; 

      Shizuma chuckled.  &quot;I&#39;ll get you to confess soon, but not now.  We 
need to head to dance practice.&quot; 

      &quot;I&#39;ll be down in a few minutes.  I need to finish this first.&quot; 

      Shizuma kissed Kaori&#39;s cheek.  &quot;Okay, but don&#39;t be late.&quot;  She 
released Kaori&#39;s shoulders and started heading for the door.  &quot;See you 
later,&quot; she said before exiting the room. 

      &quot;I won&#39;t be long!&quot; Kaori yelled, uncertain if Shizuma would hear 
her.  Her smile widened and she turned her letter face-up. 

      This letter wouldn&#39;t remain a secret for long, Kaori believed as 
she continued writing.  Her feelings were already in the open, so its 
contents could hardly be considered &quot;secret.&quot;  Shizuma would find the 
letter and then be able to move on.  Once she did, Kaori would be able 
to rest in peace. 

      Kaori&#39;s pen had reached the end.  The lilies would be in full 
bloom soon.</pre>
