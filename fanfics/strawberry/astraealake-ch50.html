<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Apologies in  advance for exessive Kaname thoughts and Kaname swearing. She has a lot  to think and swear about. </span></p>
</span>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Kaname threw herself onto the bed, burying her face in the pillows. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hopefully,  no one will notice I’m not in my lessons, or if not, no one will come.  If they do, I’ll just say I’m sick. Maybe I am sick. I feel ill. </span></em>Kaname touched her warm face again. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  heat, and this agonising feeling… perhaps I have a fever. Can you get  that; illness brought on by too much emotion? I feel like I might  burst. Or is it the other way round; are there illnesses that cause  hysteria? Only mental illnesses, I think, but I’m no doctor. Nor do I  want to call myself a manic-depressive just yet. I’m pretty sure that’s  something different, as well. I’m no psychologist. But is it possible  to be manic and depressive at the same time? I don’t think so, so I  guess I’m just over-dramatising. What do I know about anything? Not  much, really. But enough to know I don’t like feeling like this. I  haven’t felt this messed up in the head since I had that huge row with  Momomi a while back. Why, though? That was a serious matter, because  I’d been betrayed… but this, what’s wrong with this, exactly? It isn’t  something I can put my finger on, but it is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.  I’m sure of it. I’m just not sure why it’s wrong. Which is infuriating.</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She crushed her pillow in her grip, deriving some satisfaction from the sensation. <em>Well,  I know why it’s wrong. That’s easy, right? It’s Amane. I don’t know  where that scary, obsessive freak came from but I hardly know her  anyway. She might well be that kind of demon, hidden behind her perfect  mask, just like Momomi. Only a lot worse. No, I wouldn’t put it past  Amane, to be an imbalanced stalker who’s just going to try and steal  Momomi from me. Why Momomi? Well, I think she has wonderful qualities,  but I’m pretty alone in that, now aren’t I? I refuse to believe that  Momomi’s dropped her guard around Amane so fast. Can Amane read her?  Even if she could, surely the very fact she has to is unattractive?  Honestly, that bitch has the entire school to choose from, more or  less, so why Momomi? I just can’t work it out. Especially when she  knows that Momomi confessed to me so recently and that she’s being used  for that. Is that it? The mystery and the challenge of it? Is she  trying to see if her power over people really is that strong? Or is she  out to get me, because this is a damn good way to cut me too the quick…</em>For the first time, a smirk cut through Kaname’s hazy anger. <em>Yeah,  right. Now that’s just delusional. I’m still not worth her time, I  could hear her thinking that. I’ll definitely prove her wrong.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname closed her eyes for a few moments. <em>Okay,  that’s phase one, nonsensical venting, out of the way. I feel a little  better now. Time for phase two, rational thought. Certainly, I don’t  like how she talks, but it’s not like I like Amane anyway. The problem  is, everyone else does, and half the school would die to have her talk  that way about them. Even Momomi finds her interesting, if nothing  else, and she shares my disdain for most of humanity. And where Amane  is antisocial out of choice, I’m antisocial out of choice and even if I  wasn’t I don’t have a choice. I’m an unpopular person, and even if  Momomi makes it sound like it would be so easy to change all that I’m  not so sure. But most of all, Amane is rich, refined, intelligent,  athletic, dignified, of the same aristocratic origins as Momomi, and  above all, beautiful. Her beauty could also be described as handsome,  just like my own. I may hate her, but I acknowledge those qualities.  That’s why she’s my rival. If I reduce it to that, it’s obvious that  she’s a good candidate. No, more than that, for Momomi as my friend to  attract the attention of such an outstanding and otherwise aloof  person, I should be glad. I’m not, I’m no saint. Neither is Amane, for  that matter. But we even look alike, and we’re not so far distant in  some aspects of our personality. Even if I’m sure of Momomi’s feelings,  which I am; she wouldn’t confess idly…there’s still the fact that we’re  similar. She might accept Amane’s advances to help her forget, or even  as a kind of substitute. I don’t like thinking she could be so fickle,  but she’s already playing games with me. It’s not like she’s not hurt,  so objectively it’s hard to blame her if she does what is necessary to  be happier again. </em>Kaname snorted. <em>Even so, that’s a pompous way  to think. If I was to ask anyone out there, the answer would be clear,  wouldn’t it? Amane’s superior to me, that’s what they’d all say. I hate  that. But when we’re so similar, comparisons will be made, and someone  like me will never come out favourably. I wasn’t chosen by birth. I’m  not Amane.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname bit her lip, rallying slightly. <em>But I’m  glad of that, damnit. I don’t have to apologise for not being her! Not  to Momomi, not to anyone! I don’t want to be an impassive person with  no energy and no sense of the real world outside her cosy aristocracy.  And anyway, Momomi says she prefers me, more or less. Because I got  here on my own, which I did, that’s something she admires. Sure, Amane  is admired for a lot of things by a lot of people, but I don’t give a  damn. With Momomi, it actually means something. And it was right, what  I said. I’m the one who’s stood by her. Even if that doesn’t mean I own  her, that means something. It has to mean something. We’re friends.  Close friends. We’ve worked hard and sacrificed a lot, and that’s not  usual because sincerity and earnestness doesn’t come easily to either  of us. But we’ve managed, somehow. That’s why. That’s why I’m not  ashamed of not being that Amane. It doesn’t matter to Momomi, and if  she likes me that’s enough. At the very least, it’s a lot better than  how things were before. Before, I didn’t really even like myself. What  was it? Cracked girl? Yeah, I was pretty miserable back then, I  remember. Well, thanks to her I’m fine, wherever I came from and  whatever I’m like. You don’t have to be a good person to have someone  who cares for you.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>On the other hand… Amane’s still the  all-around perfect girl. And she does have the same background as  Momomi. Momomi said that herself. When you look at it, wouldn’t they  have a lot more in common? No, it’s not like that…everything we’ve been  through is something in common unto itself, by now. And we always have  something to say to each other. When we talk, it flows, and when we’re  silent, it’s comfortable. That’s not a problem. Why would I lose to  someone like Amane? </em>Kaname shook her head. <em>Wait, why is it even  a matter of that? For once, this isn’t about a contest between us,  because we’re not even running for the same thing. I’m Momomi’s friend  and she wants to be her girlfriend. Those are different, even I know  that. And even if I don’t want Amane to be her girlfriend, it’s not  like Momomi’s choosing between us. I rejected her feelings, so she can  do what she likes. That’s fine. If she wants to date Amane, who am I to  stop her? </em>Kaname winced. <em>So why the hell does that sound so  painful in my head? Why can’t I accept that? Why am I suddenly  returning to the comparison game I stopped playing when I first got to  know Momomi? Why, on a fundamental level, does that bother me so much?  Even if she’s only calling me out, I’ve been called out, and I should  know why, but I don’t. I don’t want to accept that it’s for the reasons  she’d give if she was calling me out.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname rolled over and looked at the ceiling, stilling her body and trying to calm her chaotic thoughts. <em>Okay.  Slow down. Think about this. You aren’t stupid. One explanation… one  explanation which would explain a lot of things about yourself… is that  explanation. At least consider it as a hypothesis. Sometimes a lot of  people say the same thing and they’re being stupid, but that doesn’t  mean a lot of people saying the same thing is wrong all the time. And  sometimes I make mistakes. Of course. I’m only human. So think this  through. First of all. Why is this possibility to revolting for me?  Because it disgusts me? I don’t think so. A few of the things I’ve done  with Momomi have bordered on… weird, but none of them felt wrong. I  enjoyed it. And so, if I think about, hugging’s fine. Done that before.  Holding hands…done that. Feeding each other, done that. Kissing would  be…weird. That’s just freaky to thing about. Perhaps I was right after  all. But then again, if you asked me whether I’d enjoy holding hands  with her before the fact…I don’t know. I doubt I’d expect to like it.  I’d flush just to think of it. So, what, I can’t know whether I’d enjoy  kissing until I’ve tried it? That’d be way too… weird. Maybe. Or it  could feel right, which is an even scarier thought. So, I don’t know, I  really don’t. Once I’ve got after the shock factor, it’s not like the  idea disgusts me too much. I’ve had thoughts like that before, but only  as a teen. I think about boys a lot more, even though I don’t know any.  That has to count for something, right? Even if I want to believe that,  I came from a background even more homophobic than Momomi’s. Whatever.  But I let Momomi do a lot more than I would anything else, if nothing  else. Isn’t that what liking someone is? A unification of personal  space…or something. I’m not a marriage counsellor either.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No,  if I really did…like her, or even if I was capable of trying, like  Amiki said, I should be glad of that, and that thought. So, why does it  scare me? Wounded pride would be another good reason, for someone like  me. </em>Kaname smiled weakly. <em>I’m used to screwing up, but this  would be a big mistake even for me. Compare Momomi’s confidence with  this mental bungling around…I still I wish I had that, her certainty. I  wish I could thank her for her feelings and support Amane. I wish I  could take her by the hand and say I’ve made the biggest mistake of my  life, so can she forgive me and stay? One of the two. That’d be nice.  Unfortunately, I don’t have anything like that clarity. It’s taken me  this long to realise the depth of my own ambiguity. But even if this  would objectively be good news, it would make my life a lot more  complicated. I’d have to take Amane seriously as a love rival of a  kind, and she’s not an easy person to oppose. More than that, I’d have  to tell Momomi. Amane’s right about one thing…I’m not good at saying  things, I prefer to take, to feed off what Momomi gives me. But if this  true, I screwed up my chance to easily slide into this when I rejected  her confession. This time around, I’d have to say… it to her. And  considering the fact that I did reject her, and how complex things have  been since, there are new pressures. Of course, it should still be  easier than when she did it with me… she knew she had so chance. I  should be able to manage even a quarter of her courage, and that should  be enough. I know her feelings, so what would be stopping me?  Embarrassment? Pride? Don’t be stupid. There are more important things  at stake here. Much, much more important.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But what if her feelings have changed? What if she’d mad with me now? What if Amane’s already taken hold? </em>Kaname snorted. <em>Yeah,  right. That’s just plain stupid. But all the same, I’ve already wasted  time. Amane’s not going to mess around or hesitate, she knows she’s the  perfect one. The longer I leave it, the more dangerous things will  become for me, and the more chance there is that she’ll reject me. On  the other hand, wouldn’t a greater length of time between then and this  make me look like less of an idiot? As if I’d taken time to work it  out, or my feelings had changed, I could present it as that. On the  other hand, the longer I wait, that more that proves I don’t know my  own feelings. And that’s the problem. I still don’t know my own  feelings, I just know enough to take both possibilities seriously. I  can’t attempt to be decisive like this, but every day I spent working  myself out is a day working in Amane’s favour. What am I supposed to do  like this? Accept right now and play it safe? But I don’t think I could  bring myself to that unless I really was sure…and if we dated and it  turned out I didn’t… feel that way… after all, I’m sure she’d never  forgive me. That would just hurt her, and I don’t want that. Or step  back and let Amane make her play? Support Amane, even, as the other  just in case… don’t screw with me. I‘m not a tragic heroine and I’m not  in the business of martyring my own emotions. That kind of thing’s just  illogical, especially when she likes me. But still, I could let Amane  try and fail, that’d clear things up. Unless she succeeded. This is  hardly something I can take a chance over. But I can’t take a chance  with my ambiguous emotions, either. I can lean one way or the other,  but either way, I stand to lose. Is this what she intended? Did she  want me to feel this way, and be faced by these choices? I wish I knew.  But if there’s a chance she’s serious and I was wrong, I have to take  both as a certainty. I really can’t take a chance over this.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  then there’s one more thing. I still haven’t said it, have I? Not  properly. Stupid. If I can’t even say it to myself, I definitely won’t  be able to say anything to her. But it’s still weird. It’s still… hard  to grasp, and a wound to my pride, and not something I’m certain about.  But I’ve been ignoring the possibility, acting way too defensive and  denying even the chance that I miscalculated. That’s even more stupid,  and hurts my pride even more. I need to open my eyes. </em>Kaname folded her hands behind her head and sighed. <em>If  only I knew how to do that. But I can still say it. I might… like,  Momomi. I might have felt that way all this time, and I might want  myself, not Amane, to be her girlfriend. I wish I was certain. But  that’s the way it is. I like Momomi. I don’t like Momomi. I wish I  could say one or the other, because I hate to be confused like this.  But that’s the way it is. So, how do I find out for sure? I wish I  knew…I need to take this one step at the time. And I need to remember  that, in case I try to forget this moment, or dismiss it as pointless  uncertainty and angst. I’m sure it’s not that. It has to be. Liking  Momomi…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname closed her eyes and thought of Momomi and  Amane and her tangled, chaotic feelings, and tried not to notice the  passage of time. She also tried to work out what to do next, which had  something to do with Momomi, but she wasn’t quite sure what. <em>Apologise to her? Thank her? Kiss her? Warn her Amane was bad news? Try to explain? Act naturally and wait for confirmation?</em> There were a lot of possibilities, many of which made Kaname blush and  shudder, but she didn’t know which was the right choice to make. <em>Of  course. I can’t choose between two very simple states, so I’d stand no  chance at a more complex decision about this. But still, it’s a bother.  I have to do something. This is hardly something I can play by the ear,  though, is it? I could screw up so easily and mess things up even more…</em>Kaname sighed, looking back and wondering at that Momomi went through under similar circumstances. <em>But  still. Sitting around and moping in here won’t achieve anything. This  kind of situation calls for action. Probably. But I’m good at action,  so I’ll try that anyway. Action sounds good. It’s pretty easy to  understand. </em>She checked her watch, frowned, and rolled off her  bed, walking over to the dressing table and checking her reflection in  the mirror. Her hair was ruffled, so she brushed it as best she could.  Her face was paler than she was used to, or perhaps she was just  imagining things. <em>Looks like I used all my blood in my argument with Amane. Oh, well. I doubt anyone will notice. </em>She  self-consciously adjusted the set of her necktie, then checked her  watch again. It was fifteen minutes until break. She paced up and down  for two of them, then stopped herself. She leaned against the wall and  folded her arms for another three, wondering why she was so twitchy.  Then she snapped and left, heading for Momomi’s History classroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname arrived five minutes too early, scowled and leaned against the wall, folding her arms. <em>Right  classroom, check. Cool pose, check. Close your eyes and this will be my  everyday waiting-for-Momomi posture. Nothing suspicious at all. Except  the fact that I’m so damn early, but she doesn’t have to know that, now  does she? Everything’s normal. Heck, I don’t have anything  extraordinary to say anyway?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s eyes snapped open, looking up at the Superior. <em>Shit! Since when did she bother to leave her office? </em>“Me- I’m… uh…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You got sent out of the classroom, didn’t you?” The Superior sniffed. “What did you do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I-  uh… talking. I was talking too much. And making sarcastic comments. And  suchlike.” Kaname realised that someone caught out by the principle  shouldn’t sound so <em>relieved</em>, so she struck out for a tone of  wounded pride. “It wasn’t like it was just me, either. It was the whole  class, but she made an example of me! It’s discrimination, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  enough. You have a bad reputation as it is, Kenjou, I suggest you don’t  add to it. You’re disrupting the learning of the other students.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  well-” Kaname caught the glare she was receiving, and decided to stop  talking. “Sorry, Superior-sama. It won’t happen again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. And  straighten your posture! Don’t slouch like that! You’re being punished,  so don’t be that casual. Stand up straight.” The Superior glared at  her. “I’m tempted to go in and tell Kuroi-sensei just how feckless you  are about your punishments.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please don’t do that, Superior-sama,” Kaname asked with absolute sincerity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm. Well, remember this, Kenjou. Your behaviour has been improving recently, don’t ruin that progress now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes, Superior-sama.” Kaname watched her go with a deep sense of relief. <em>So  my behaviour’s been improving, has it? News to me. I guess I’ve been so  busy being obnoxious to other people that haven’t found the energy to  do the same thing with the teachers. Plus I don’t have to worry about  Olesa any more. </em>She frowned. <em>I’m surprised she noticed, though. I hardly see her around. Does Shion submit her reports? No, more likely the Etoiles…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bell rang, cutting through her thoughts, so she leaned back and adopted her <em>waiting-for-Momomi </em>position again. She closed her eyes and bit her lip. <em>Though,  when I think about it, this is pretty much a metaphor for my own  dishonesty. Even though I actually really want to see her, I have to  make it look like I just happen to be leaning against a wall thinking  about all the interesting things I could be doing instead of waiting  around for her. Of course, it’s not like that fools her or anyone else,  especially after… everything, really. But still, I try to keep up that  appearance. Even if I criticise Amane for abusing indifference, I try  and adopt that same careless, cool attitude myself. As Momomi would  say, I’m quite the hypocrite. </em>The other students of Momomi’s class  slowly passed her in their twos and threes. Kaname was used to their  complete disinterest in her presence by now, it was something common  and accepted. But this time, people glanced at her out of the corners  of their eyes and whispered. She opened her eyes and gave some of them  her special glare, which shut most of them up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But there was always the one person who wouldn’t shut up, with or without the death gaze. “Good morning, Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yo.” Kaname pushed off the wall and fell into step with Momomi, just like ever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t <em>yo </em>me,” Momomi teased. “Where the hell were you this morning?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I  had a cat-fight with Amane and she broke out the stalker talk about  making you hers. Stay away from her if you don’t want to be duct-taped  to a horse and sent bad places. </em>Kaname cursed her graphic imagination. “I was taking a walk,” she said evasively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Taking a walk?” Momomi asked, raising her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can, can’t I? You do too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. It’s a little odd, that’s all. You weren’t even in the canteen  when I got back.” Momomi narrowed her eyes suspiciously. “Say, did you  even eat breakfast?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.” Kaname shrugged. “Come on, are you telling me that’s a big deal?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course it’s a big deal! Didn’t your mother ever tell you that it’s the most important meal in the day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She never told me.” Kaname scowled. “I assume she thought that you would, instead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When I think about it, though, I’m not quite sure <em>why </em>it’s  the most important meal in the day,” Momomi mused. “Perhaps because  it’s the one that gets skipped most often by teenagers. But that’s not  the point! If you’re skipping breakfast, you need a better reason than  simply going for a walk.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was a long walk,” Kaname replied defensively. “I went into the forest and lost track of time, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Idiot.” Momomi rubbed her face. “You really are dependant on me, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut up! Like I said, no harm done. I’ve skipped plenty of breakfasts in my time, and at a younger age too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  a teenager now, you know.” Momomi pouted at her. “If you don’t eat  properly, your development will be stunted. If you know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname flushed. “Shut up. How about you? Did you manage to eat something in between flirting with Amane? Some hay, perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  actually. Unlike you, I have some time management, and I made it to the  canteen in good time.” Momomi glanced at her. “You hadn’t got my  breakfast, though. Amiki saved me there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname folded her arms. “Well, if you’re flying off to talk to <em>her </em>I don’t know why I should. And this shows you’re just as dependant as me, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  yes.” Momomi shrugged. “Well, you should go and eat now, if nothing  else. Otherwise you’ll be really hungry for the next two periods.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And have you skip off to Amane? </em>“I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Seriously. You may be fine now, but you won’t be. Mark my words.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “You’ll find I’m made of tougher stuff than you are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Fine, fine. Well, if you’re really set on being stupid, I can’t stuff it down your throat.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname didn’t say anything more, just watching Momomi as discreetly as possible. <em>Staring  at someone isn’t exactly careless and cool, after all. Quite the  opposite. But there’s not much to learn. Yeah, she’s cute and  dollfaced, I knew that since forever. The complete opposite of me,  really, even if she’s a little on the short side. But that’s kinda cute  too…it’s one of the reasons why I’ve always been hung up on protecting  her, I suppose. She looks like she needs it, even if she doesn’t.  Actually, those two qualities together must be quite useful for her…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at her curiously. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blushed and looked away. “Of course. I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi cocked her head. “You looked a little pale, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “I do? I didn’t notice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  you wouldn’t, would you?” Momomi prodded her friend on the arm. “Well,  there you go. Breakfast is important because you go pale without it, or  something. Though with your weird hair, anyone would look pale.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s eyes narrowed. “Well, thanks for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  no problem.” Momomi wrapped a curl of her hair round one of her  fingers, playing with it gently. Kaname found the gesture mesmerising.  “You spend so much time in your room, after all. I suppose it’s only  natural.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, right,” Kaname growled. “As if you’re any  different… you’ve spent pretty much your entire life being indoorsy,  from what I’ve heard. Apart from your damn horse riding, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like  I said, we were never really into that. Mother preferred gardening.”  Momomi shrugged. “I guess that comes to the same thing, though. But I  don’t think my complexion’s that bad.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then it’s not a matter staying indoors, is it?” Kaname said, feeling strangely defensive. “Besides, I’m a lot fitter than you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  probably right.” Momomi continued to twirl her hair round her finger.  “It’s a matter of being ill from the lack of food that does it. You  really should eat something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you,” Kaname growled. “I’m fine. Being pale never killed anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m just being considerate, you know. Someone like you would kill themselves out of stubbornness if I’m not careful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed. “Well, it’s not like I don’t know that. But no one died of skipping breakfast.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright. Whatever you say.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  released the curl of hair and smoothed it out with a casual gesture,  tucking it back into place. Kaname frowned at the sight. <em>She has very obedient hair. I’d never be able to get away with that, and mine is half her length…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  stepped outside, looking up and stretching her neck idly. “You know,  though, another thing… if you’re going to chew me out because I’m  spending all of half an hour a day with Amane, shouldn’t you at least  turn up for breakfast when we can talk?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did you miss me?”  Kaname asked, lips twitching into a frown. “Or did you turn up late  again because you were too busy with her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I missed you.” Momomi  closed her eyes momentarily. “If only because Amiki without you… well,  I suppose it’s like playing chess without my queen in the starting  pieces.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still just a piece on the board, eh?” But Kaname said that lightly, feeling a little reassured, all the same. <em>I’m used to people being dishonest, after all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, yes. Plus the aforementioned hypocrisy was annoying.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  come on. I made an honest mistake, already.” Kaname was beginning to  get uncomfortable with just how comfortable she was with that lie. <em>Besides,  I’ve kinda shot myself in the foot, haven’t I? I can hardly warn her  about Amane’s designs if I supposedly haven’t talked to Amane to know  them…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi gave her a vaguely suspicious look. “Well, it  can’t be helped, I suppose. I’ll forgive you this time around, so don’t  let it happen again.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right, right. And what are you doing now?” Kaname demanded. “Off to flirt with Amane again?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi quirked her eyebrows. “That word’s been coming up a lot, you know. Are you really that jealous?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname scowled. “Of course. Don’t get too cocky, damnit!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  rolled her eyes. “And I suppose yesterday’s debacle was to prevent me  from getting too cocky, damnit. Well, whatever lets you sleep at night.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  gritted her teeth. “Well, it’s not you. If you were as fickle as all  that I’d never forgive you anyway. But Amane worries me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Amane? Is this your rival thing, again?” Momomi sighed. “I do understand your feelings, but-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not that,” Kaname snapped. “What I mean is… well… that’s to say…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s to say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, what if <em>she </em>was to fall for <em>you? </em>Hypothetically.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  gave her a strange look. “Why on earth would that happen? This is the  probably-straight ice prince Ohtori we’re talking, you know. She barely  tolerates my presence as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, I know that,” Kaname said lamely. “It was just a hypothesis.” <em>Yeah, talk about shooting myself in the foot…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi frowned. “Why would that bother you anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>No, I should have saved that for now. </em>“Because  it’s Amane, of course.” Kaname glanced at her. “Besides, if she was to  be your girlfriend or whatever, you’d spent less time with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “You’re really one possessive friend, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“After everything, I think I’m entitled,” Kaname replied defensively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes,  yes. Well, at least I know you care.” Momomi glanced at Kaname. “You’re  going to be hell if I ever get a girlfriend, aren’t I? Amane’s not  going to be one, though. She’s herself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just… think about it. That’s all.” Kaname frowned and looked away. “It’s not like you’re an unattractive person…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked for a moment, then recovered herself. “Was that a <em>compliment</em>? From you, Kaname? Hell is suffering from inclement weather.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No need to be sarcastic. And don’t get used to it, either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Believe  me, I won’t. It’s not like you’ll give me the chance.” Momomi stopped  short as they reached the paddock. “Well… see you later, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just nodded and watched her leave.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I’m such a coward. But, for all that, I do think I like you, Momomi. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fuck.</em></span></p>
