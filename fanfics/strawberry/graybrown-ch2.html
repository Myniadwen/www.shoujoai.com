<h1>Blue-Haired Gray Eyes, Blue-Haired Brown Ones (part 2 of 12)</h1>

<a href="../strawberry/graybrown-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Besides representing Miator to the other schools within Astraea Hill, 
the Miator Student Council President also represents the school&#39;s 
student body to all external stakeholders, including parents, teachers 
and visitors from other schools...&quot;

Miyuki and Tamao are in the Student Council Room of Miator: Miyuki at 
the blackboard chalking key words and phrases, Tamao at the Council 
table taking notes. They have been meeting after school for several days 
now, with Miyuki explaining the various roles and responsibilities of 
the Student Council. Their regular interactions have only served to 
reinforce their mutual respect. Tamao suspects that Miyuki has not only 
carried out her many duties as Student Council President, but has 
discreetly performed several of the former Etoile&#39;s duties as well. On 
her part, Miyuki finds herself impressed time and again by Tamao&#39;s 
intelligence and insight: the younger woman had a photographic memory 
for facts that was surprisingly complemented by a keen understanding of 
politics. Today, feeling especially pleased with her pupil&#39;s progress, 
Miyuki decides to call for an uncharacteristic break.

&quot;Tamao-san, why don&#39;t we go out for a walk? The weather looks 
exceptionally fine today.&quot;

Tamao glances up from her notes, surprised by her mentor&#39;s spontaneous 
good cheer. She has grown accustomed to Miyuki&#39;s seriousness and 
reserve, and is therefore pleasantly surprised to see this unexpected 
side to the older woman. Also, she misses the Astraean scenery. Since 
Nagisa and Shizuma have started going out together, she has lost a 
favorite walking companion and has abandoned the pastime altogether. For 
the first time in a long while, a genuine smile of pleasure lights up 
the younger girl&#39;s face.

&quot;That would be lovely, Rokuj?-sama.&quot;

~~~~~

They walk in silence for a good while, simply enjoying the weather, the 
landscape, and the undemanding presence of the other. Tamao pauses on 
occasion to admire bits of scenery: an icicle, a snowflake, the remains 
of a snowman.

Miyuki marvels at the younger girl&#39;s quiet pleasure, a fact made more 
touching by her awareness of Tamao&#39;s private grief. It is this quality, 
Miyuki decides, that Tamao has in common with Nagisa. Both girls had the 
uncanny ability to delight in the simplest things despite the most 
painful circumstances - and to transmit that joy to others. Such a 
contrast, Miyuki muses, to how she and Shizumi had dealt with their own 
tragedies in the past or continued to deal with them in the present...

A sudden stinging sensation on her right shoulder jolts Miyuki out of 
her thoughts. Startled, she looks around and finds Tamao staring 
intently at a bush on the far side of the path, drops of melted snow 
clinging to her right glove. Miyuki&#39;s eyes narrow...

Thwaaack!

&quot;Rokuj?-sama!&quot; Tamao gives a yelp of surprise and rubs the side of her 
head. &quot;You didn&#39;t have to hit me back on the head!&quot;

To her own surprise, Miyuki finds herself laughing openly at Tamao&#39;s 
shock. &quot;Punishment for insubordinate behavior, Tamao-san. And, yes, I 
have a really good aim with snowballs.&quot;

In that one careless moment, with Miyuki&#39;s guard down and a smile on her 
face, Tamao thinks to herself with surprise, Why, Rokuj?-sama, you&#39;re 
beautiful.

~~~~~

They are strolling by the woods, their breaths steaming in the wintry 
air. Their afternoon lectures have slowly given way to afternoon walks. 
Miyuki still talks occasionally about the Student Council, to explain 
odd bits of fact or procedure. Tamao has noticed that whenever the older 
woman mentions the former Etoile, her hand reaches for her neck in what 
appears to be an unconscious gesture.

They are near the edge of the woods when they first hear the voices: the 
first a low, musical drawl; the second a bright, chirpy staccato. They 
look involuntarily at each other, and turn away just as quickly. Neither 
has anticipated the look of concern and sympathy on the other&#39;s face. By 
the time Shizuma and Nagisa come into view, they are both preoccupied 
with other thoughts.

&quot;Tamao-chan! Rojuk?-sama!&quot; Nagisa waves cheerfully at her best friend. 
It does not escape Miyuki&#39;s notice that the red-haired girl has moved 
slightly away from Shizuma&#39;s figure upon seeing Tamao.

Tamao smiles warmly at her closest friend and bows slightly towards the 
former Etoile. &quot;Nagisa-chan, Shizuma-sama. Have you been busy at the 
greenhouse?&quot;

Nagisa nods and shakes her head ruefully. &quot;Amane-san and Hikari-san 
aren&#39;t used to caring for flowers, so we&#39;ve been helping them out a 
bit.&quot;

Miyuki lifts an eyebrow at Shizuma. &quot;You didn&#39;t use to be so helpful, 
Shizuma. It must be Nagisa-san&#39;s influence.&quot;

Shizuma gives a lazy grin. &quot;I can be diligent when properly motivated, 
Miyuki.&quot;

The tension between the two older women does not escape their younger 
charges. Tamao hesitates, then speaks.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you and Nagisa-chan are eager to clean up after your work, 
Shizuma-sama, so we won&#39;t keep you any longer.&quot;

Tamao bows again to the silver-haired woman, gives Nagisa a small smile 
and continues down the path. To her relief, Miyuki has followed her 
lead. The older woman has a brooding expression on her face, and once 
again her hand is at her neck.  

~~~~~

It is nearly midnight but Miyuki cannot sleep. She stands by her window, 
her right hand absently rubbing the space below her collarbone. She 
remembers the key she carried for two years. I gave her back her heart 
after carrying it all these years - and she didn&#39;t even have the decency 
to give me back mine. But tonight, for some reason, she cannot muster 
her anger or her hate. She tries to recall all the times when Shizuma 
had twisted the knife-like edge of pain into her heart. But the only 
image that comes to mind is the look of concern on a blue-haired girl&#39;s 
face. Sighing, Miyuki goes to bed and closes her eyes. Dawn is a long 
way from coming.</pre>
