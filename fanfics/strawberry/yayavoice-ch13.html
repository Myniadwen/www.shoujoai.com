<p><strong>Yaya:  Taking a step forward? Or back?</strong></p>
<p>“Ow…  ow… What kind of girl cuts herself seventeen times?!” I scolded  myself for being so incredibly clumsy with a kitchen knife.</p>
<p>I  looked at my right hand, as my left hand was busy carrying my lunch  box, and there it was Eight of Seventeen cuts, Ten of Twenty Two  pieces of bandages, the other five is from that episode I had last  week when I went berserk in the art room, suffice to say that some of  them weren’t healing as fast. Not that it was anything new… mom  always said that my wounds always took longer than most people to  heal. But despite that, and the possibility of scaring my hands, I  don’t regret them… as painful as they are they felt like a small  price to pay.</p>
<p>The  ones I got from cooking, or at least trying to do so, I do very much  regret. I openly admit that I cannot cook to save my life. Hell I  probably can learn to cook if my relationship with Hikari depended on  it, which until a few days ago weighed heavier than cooking for my  life. But I supposed I should at least learn enough to live on for  the future or so I said to myself when I took Tendo-san up on her  offer to teach me how to cook.</p>
<p>Anyway…  I found myself walking towards the lake. It was just about lunch  time, or before lunch time… I’m not really sure because our  teachers gave us a bunch of free periods to start some preparation  for the upcoming school festival and I just decided to escape work  while no one was looking.</p>
<p>Soon  enough I found myself at the lake side. The trail was full of fallen  leaves and the wild grass was quite full, it was autumn after all,  which meant my steps were quite noticeable but since I didn’t think  anyone would be around to hide from at this time so I didn’t really  mind them. It was calming in a way.</p>
<p>It  was then that I saw someone I never expected to see there. “Ootori?”  I blurted out my words seconds before I thought of it.</p>
<p>She  turned her head ever so slightly to look from the corner of her eye  but suddenly turned her head to face me all the same saying;  “Nanto-sama…”</p>
<p>“Sama?!”  I exclaimed in surprise. “Not you too…” I’m sure my voice  sounded a hint disgusted when I had said that, it was a bit of a  shock for me but I got over it quickly after all… after the fans,  Tsubomi-chan and Hikari… no wait scratch that… I was very  shocked. Even Ootori was acting weird. And at that point maybe I  began regretting a lot of things, probably including my decision to  come here... and I’m not exactly sure if it’s just my current  local or the decision I made three years ago.</p>
<p>“You  have your voice back!?” she almost yelled out. She looked very  surprised. I wasn’t myself… because the thought of picking on  her, Ootori Amane-sama: Prince of Spica, sounded very interesting.</p>
<p>I  looked at her with a poker face to hide the intent to mess with her  head, though I’m not quite sure if I was able to completely hide  the hint of annoyance in my eyes, before I said, “Isn’t it  obvious? And shouldn’t the news have reached you already…  yesterday at the very latest?” It’s true anyway, news spreads  faster in Spica than the other two schools or so I’ve heard anyway.</p>
<p>She  thought about it for a moment before confirming my words with an “Oh  yeah… It did…” which didn’t sound very lively.</p>
<p>I  then walked towards her and sat close enough to say I was beside her  but far enough to make a point.</p>
<p>“Why  are you here?” I bluntly asked. I have only heard Hikari mention  her name just a handful of times in the past days since my return and  I have to be honest that it was quite bitter sweet. It made me wonder  if they’re arguing… but only for a flicker of a moment that makes  me wonder now why I bothered mentioning it at all.</p>
<p>She  answered quickly saying; “The school allotted time for everyone to  make some preparations for the festival.”</p>
<p>And  for a moment I lost my poker composure and harshly countered her  words; “That doesn’t really answer my question does it?”</p>
<p>“No…  I suppose it doesn’t…” she replied, obviously nervous.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…”  I wasn’t sure what to say… I’m good at teasing Hikari and  Tsubomi, but this girl was never on my list.</p>
<p>After  a short silence she said; “What are you doing here, if I may ask.”</p>
<p>I  wanted to say ‘no you can’t…’ but seeing as she had already,  I might as well say something. I quickly considered what would be a  ‘smart ass’ response which was: “Probably the same thing as you  are.”</p>
<p>“And  that would be?...” She leaned closer, why exactly was a mystery to  me for only a moment… when I realized what she was doing I copied  her and technically returned the question.</p>
<p>“I  don’t know. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>I  knew I won the moment she sighed. I watched her as she turned her  head towards the lake and said: “Thinking. I guess…”</p>
<p>I  continued to watch her as the light bounce with a soft gleam from her  odd crimson eyes. I wondered why I noticed that. I felt angry about  it for a moment but decided the less I pondered about things the  better… especially if it had something to do with Hikari or Ootori.  Yes… that would probably be best. Don’t ponder about them to  much.</p>
<p>Then  it just slipped out. “Nope! That’s not what I’m doing…” I  planned on ending the conversation and just going somewhere else. But  instead these words came out and got her attention.</p>
<p>“Oh?”  she said as she turned her attention towards me again. And I knew  from the look on her eyes she wanted me to tell her what I’m doing  here without her asking. But of course I didn’t and wouldn’t…  not even if she asked. “So… what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>I  looked up to avoid her gaze. I hate her eyes… Those red eyes of  this prince like girl… that made me want to answer her. And as I  was looking up I wished that the tree’s leaves would all just fall  and bury me right then and there. But what are the chances of that  happening…</p>
<p>“I  guess I’m running away from someone…” I answered.</p>
<p>“Eh?”  was all she let out as a response.</p>
<p>“Surprised?”  I looked at her again and immediately regretted it… the look on her  eyes screamed “Tell me about it!” only accented more by her face  that had curiosity written all over it. She nodded… once, a simple  run of a mill, dull and normal nod… but why did it feel like she  was begging me to tell her all about it.</p>
<p>“A  friend of mine confessed to me.” I answered her unspoken plea.</p>
<p>Well  it’s technically the reason why… but not the whole truth. You  see… After Tsubomi confessed her love and we got back from our  weekend trip… she’s been acting differently. I clearly recall  telling her that I’m not ready. But what does she do? She clings to  me any chance she gets. It was embarrassing. Just yesterday she  coincidentally met me in the cafeteria restroom and she stuck to me  like glue till lunch was over. This happened at dinner too and Hikari  was giving us this weird look that I’m not sure how to translate.</p>
<p>It’s  not like I hate Tsubomi’s attention, I just don’t feel  comfortable with Hikari being able to see her that close to me... not  to mention everyone else seeing her close to me. I know I shouldn’t  care… but I do. It’s just not normal! And I haven’t told Hikari  that she was with me when I went out last weekend… I don’t think  I can tell her either. I feel like I’m doing something wrong. Well  I shouldn’t worry about it too much, my business is my business…  unless I make it her business which would mean opening up to her  which I’m quite sure isn’t happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>Anyway…  Ootori seemed incredibly surprised and worried about it. She reacted  out with a very loud: <strong>“EH?!?!”</strong></p>
<p>“Hey!  Don’t shout! It’s not like it was Hikari.” I told her, which  only painfully remained me of the awful truth… But for some reason  she looked really worried. My mind wondered for a moment only for me  to mentally kick myself and stopped the wondering process. Then I  said: “Anyway… long story short… I just wanted to be alone, so  I thought of looking for some new place to hang around. This girl  knows all of the places I like to slack off on.” Just to cover the  short amount of time I held myself in thought.</p>
<p>“I  see…” she nodded and looked away, seemingly worried or  disappointed. Not that I should care.</p>
<p>“You  won’t tell anyone I’m hiding around here would you?” I asked  her, teasingly putting a cute expression on my face or at least I  think I did.</p>
<p>But  I got the response I was hoping for anyway so it was good. And oddly  I found myself teasing her again saying: “And no more holding me  down and kissing me against my will alright?”</p>
<p>Her  response was unexpected however. She turned a very deep shade of  crimson and looked very flustered. “Can we drop that… as  collected as I appeared back then, I’m very embarrassed about it  now.” She then looked away, her face glowing with guilt.</p>
<p>I  almost felt sorry for her... err no, that would be completely false.  I felt sorry for her. But I would not be stupid or brave enough to  admit it to anyone other than myself. I hated her so much… I  stopped considering her as a person. And I found myself thinking and  asking, “Really?... Why?” with honest and pure curiosity that  made me want to kick myself... hard.</p>
<p>She  answered me guiltily, honestly and very repentant saying that what  she did back then wasn’t like her at all. And I had to agree…  I’d like to think I at least knew her enough to not do something  like that. And for some reason… I found it funny that she admitted  to that, because I never thought she was the apologetic type. I burst  into a very audible laughing fit. She made no attempt to redeem her  pride even a little and she didn’t even try to stop my laughter,  which I’m sure I would have found a way to turn into another round  of teasing.</p>
<p>“No…  kidding…” I somehow managed to let out between laughs before  slowly stopping. We both looked away from each other and remind  silent. I took of my jacket because I was feeling a little warm from  the walk and laughing I did. I then found myself curling up, wrapping  my arms around my legs and letting my head rest on my knees. It  wasn’t the most comfortable of positions but I did it anyway and  just watched the water for a long moment.</p>
<p>I  spared a few seconds to take a short look at her. She looked…  confused…</p>
<p>Not  that I should care or at least that was what I told myself at the  time. I then had this feeling to be bad, I remembered the pack of  cigarettes I had kept in my pocket and took it out. While I was  rummaging through my pocket for the lighter I noticed that Amane had  turned her attention towards me and my devilishly forbidden item,  well at least it is in schools.</p>
<p>“Aren’t  you a little too young to smoke?” Her words sounded worried and  concerned… again not that I should care.</p>
<p>And  without really thinking too hard about what I was about to say… I  berated her for it in my own way, throwing in an angry voice and an  almost menacing glare.</p>
<p>“Okay…  I deserved that…” She cowered a little, her face full pained and  guilty. And for a moment I thought that she would start crying… not  that I should care.</p>
<p>I  lit my cigarette and quickly took a huff only to immediately cough  the smoke back out. I wasn’t used to it after all… I thought  after one pack it would become like drinking a strong carbonated  soda.</p>
<p>“Are  you ok?” She asked, sounding a little concerned.</p>
<p>“Yeah…  I’m just new at this…” I said as I pounded my chest a little,  which I soon learned doesn’t really offer any sort of relief unless  you’re choking on liquid or food.</p>
<p>“How  long have you been smoking?” she asked.</p>
<p>Oddly  enough I answered her honestly. “This would be the first stick of  the second pack of cigarettes I have.” I said before taking another  deep huff of smoke. I counted to three before blowing it out in a  long stream of smoke. I noticed that she was staring at me… or more  specifically, my lips. And of course I wouldn’t pass the chance to  make her squirm some more. “They’re dirty… but would you kiss  them?” I said to her adding a hint of seduction in my voice.</p>
<p>A  simple and dumbfounded “Eh?” was her only response. But when her  face turned as red as her eyes… I had to firmly hold my tongue  between my teeth just to keep myself from laughing.</p>
<p>“It’s  just a question, I’m not asking you to nor do I want you to…”  It was more or less the truth. I don’t want her to kiss me… I was  merely curious if she would even if my breath stank of nicotine laced  smoke. But to be honest, I had not meant to ask the stupid question.</p>
<p>“I  see…” I was a little relieved. She might just end the  conversation… or at least that odd thread. But she just had to  follow it with, “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>‘Why  did I ask?’ I asked myself. I just felt like it? It just came out  that way? I had nothing else to say? I wanted to tease her for  looking at my lips?... yeah that would probably be the best answer.  Not exactly something you says to someone who isn’t close to you  nor does it sound nice and in the end I didn’t say it. Instead this  was the answer that passed my lips, “I’ve taken the first kiss of  three girls.”</p>
<p>I  looked at her and she looked surprised but said nothing. She knew she  gave me her first kiss… she probably didn’t imagine I’d get  three.</p>
<p>“The  first one hated it… because I stole it.” I paused again and  looked at her. “Hikari has told you about our fight, I believe?”</p>
<p>I  wasn’t all that surprised when she nodded a second or two after I  had said that. She most likely knew or had been told of it by Hikari,  if not she should realize it now. I don’t think I can discuss what  exactly happened with Hikari… it’s just… too painful. After all  it had almost marked the end of our friendship. She looked unsure of  what to say or do… she looked away. I don’t blame her. If I were  in her shoes I’d have difficulty looking at me too.</p>
<p>I  tried to give her a smile but whether I succeeded or not, I’ll  probably never know. “The second one… I hated it…” I don’t  know why but I had forgiven her. I still didn’t like her very much  but… I forgive her. She did admit it was out of lust. I suppose it  was a complement… that the girl Hikari loved lusted over me. Yes,  I’ll take it as one.</p>
<p>“The  third one I did out of pity and gratitude… and though it felt good,  I don’t feel so happy that I did.” I said before I turned to my  cigarette and took in another huff. I decided to end it there… if  she wanted to make more of it… she’ll have to ask herself I’m  not about to reveal it all on my own.</p>
<p>“Why  not?” she asked, I supposed that she meant why I don’t feel happy  about kissing the third girl.</p>
<p>“Why…”  indeed… I took another breath of smoke, puffing it out into a quick  stream and gave a quick thought of how to phrase my response.  “probably… because I feel like it might be giving her false  hope.”</p>
<p>“False  hope?” She repeated in question… not that it was hard to imagine  that it be anything but a question.</p>
<p>I  nodded and puffed another stream of smoke. “Yeah… I don’t want  her to think that I might just fall for her eventually just because I  kissed her…” It was the whole truth… I had those same feelings  myself, I thought that Hikari’s feelings might change if she  realized mine... But I never really got to that part. Maybe my  approach or something was wrong… I don’t really know anymore. I  just want things to the way it was even if just on the surface, it  certainly would be easier to just go on with one’s life that way.</p>
<p>She  didn’t say anything after that. A few moments pass and my cigarette  was just about finished. I took a deeper huff than usual to just  finish it all quickly and light another one.</p>
<p>Then  out of no where she asked, “Why do you like Hikari?” which  sounded incredibly wrong, don’t usually people ask what one likes  about someone? And for some reason it annoyed me… and I just had  give her a painfully cheeky response.</p>
<p>“Why  do you have so many questions?” I blurted out angrily… I didn’t  really mean to though. The frustration is still there in my heart and  her question almost feels like putting salt on an open wound.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry…” she apologized, almost instantly. She cowered a little  and it almost appeared like she was cringing waiting for a blow from  me to come. If anyone saw us right now they would probably never  believe that she had the guts to forcefully kiss me last week. I  inwardly sighed… not that I made me feel better.</p>
<p>“Me  too… I didn’t mean it like that.” I apologized, more or less,  before taking another huff out of my cigarette… which oddly tasted  a little bitter than before. I puffed the smoke all out, creating a  think line of smoke that slowly dispersed in the air. I took a few  seconds to think about it… but nothing came to my mind. “I don’t  know anymore…”</p>
<p>A  soft, “Eh?!” came out from her lips which made me wonder if she’s  easily surprised or something else entirely, but I decided to ignore  it and go on with my point.</p>
<p>“Or  maybe I should say… I don’t know… why I like her… I didn’t  really need a reason why… she was Hikari.” It’s sort of true.  The way I fell for her didn’t require me knowing her. It was just  something my heart couldn’t avoid. I would have probably fallen for  her even if she had a sadistic personality. I’m sure I would have  fallen for her bad if she had A…</p>
<p>Anyway…  It was love at first sight. From the very moment I saw her singing at  the church’s backyard garden… I thought my heart stopped for a  few seconds, only to start up again to chase her… catch her… and  learn her name. I never truly thought about the future… my or our  future… I just wanted to be beside her. But I guess that will end…  or already has.</p>
<p>“That  didn’t sound as romantic as the thought could be.” she cheekily  said.</p>
<p>“It  doesn’t have to… It’s not like it’ll matter anymore.” I  felt a smile creep up my lips. I never thought to be romantic… I  always showed Hikari how I felt and acted like I had claimed her  already. She treated it like a joke and I never corrected her. As  stupid as it was maybe I was afraid of what she’d do if she  realized it… would she accept me? Or would she reject me? And when  I finally had the guts to try something, I made it flop badly.</p>
<p>I  sighed very softly. I could not look at her… my chest was a big mix  of so many feelings that it was hard to tell what exactly I felt. But  the silence made it easier to end the topic and move on which I  silently thanked her for then finished my cigarette. By the time I  had finished it, put the light out and threw the cigarette butt away  I realized something… I was hungry. And though I wasn’t exactly  looking forward to eating it… I just didn’t have it in me to just  walk up to a trash can and throw the lunch I made for myself away.</p>
<p>I  took it out from behind me; the bento box of death… wrapped in a  black bandana that made me feel less and less anticipating of the  meal. I didn’t know why I had two chopsticks at the time, but I  guess it was in case Tsubomi found me… maybe I was hoping my  culinary skills or the lack thereof… would make me less appealing  to her or return to the time she was tolerating my presence.</p>
<p>But  I opened it anyway… and I could tell that Ootori was looking at it.  Which immediately brought a new thought to sadistically punish the…  … to punish her. “You want some?” I asked as I held out a pair  of chopsticks for her to use.</p>
<p>To  my delight she took it and proceeded to take a sample of my  Tamagoyaki of doom and despair, yes a mouthful to say but that’s  what you’d feel if you ate it and I should mention it looked  horribly black and misshapen to start with, she ate it without  hesitation… which made me wonder why for a second before deciding  not to care. She grimaced and cringed..? It must have been all that  soy sauce that I accidentally spilled in the mixture.</p>
<p>It  was strange… she was suffering from the food I purposely fed her  and yet here I am not laughing at her misery. I didn’t wonder why.  Instead I said, “That bad huh?” and looked down on the food a  little disinterestedly. “I guess it’s to be expected.” I felt a  tiny bit depressed when I said that… I’m not sure why but when  she took the chopsticks from me and took the piece of food from the  box, I felt this small wish inside that wanted her to tell me it was  good… like that magical effect of love that makes anything made by  the one you like delicious beyond understanding.</p>
<p>“You  can just spit it out… there’s no need to force yourself for me.”  Oddly… I knew I didn’t mean those words that I said with so much  detachment. I wanted her to eat it all… suffer and in the end say  it was delicious and that it was the greatest thing she’s ever  tasted, eat every last bite of my lunch for me, then go to the  infirmary and tell the nurse to hide the fact that she threw up or  got sick.</p>
<p>It  felt like a needle prick my heart when she spat out the vile tasting  Tamagoyaki. I sighed… hiding it between her spitting and partially  choking out the disgusting food. I took a piece with my own pair of  chopsticks, swiftly bringing it into my mouth… was horrible and it  made me wonder, if I could eat this with a happy face if Hikari made  it for me…</p>
<p>And  the answer came to me instantly… I would. I found myself swallowing  and taking another piece, chewing, swallowing, taking another piece,  chewing, swallowing… I could taste all the things I placed in and  the things I accidentally added. It was enough to make your saliva  turn slimy and sticky. But when I imagined Hikari making something  like this, not that she would… I know she can cook. But really  making myself believe she cooked this… it made it easier to  swallow.</p>
<p>“How  can you eat that?” She asked… not the least bit holding her  disgust.</p>
<p>I  just smiled and said, “Like this.” Before doing what I had  previously done to the first few disgusting morsels, imagined that  Hikari made it for me then ate it. She looked like she wanted to  throw up just imagining how it must taste as I ate.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t  it taste bad?!” she asked… looking almost sick from just watching  me eat this.</p>
<p>But  I just smiled and said, “It was awful!” in an almost happy tone.</p>
<p>“Why  are you eat it then?” she cringed looking like she might throw up  soon.</p>
<p>I  just shrugged and said, “It’s not so bad…” I didn’t mean  it… It was absolutely horrible! It took a lot of my self control  and constant internal reminder about who I was to believe made this  to be able to eat it with a calm happy and contented smile. I took  out another stick of cigarette, lit it and took a huff. I choked and  coughed again… like it was my first time all over again. While  trying to relax, I proceeded to clean up after myself. It wasn’t  easy… there was no denying that what I ate wasn’t settling down  in my stomach like a normal meal, but I’d like to think that if I  can take this pain, hide it until it goes away… I can do the same  for my feelings.</p>
<p>From  the corner of my eye, I noticed that Ootori looked like she wanted to  say or point something out. I decided to let her… and be over with  it. “What’s on your mind?” I said.</p>
<p>“Ah…”  she paused… and seemed to be in thought for a while. She was  probably unsure of what to say or how to say it. I looked her way  soon enough to catch her absently nod to herself probably making the  decision to tell me what ever it was. She then said, “I think  you’re being self destructive…”</p>
<p>I  felt an inner me smile... when her voice sounded so concerned. ‘I  know that…’ was what I said to myself. I looked up to the sky  and said, “I think so too.”</p>
<p>I  felt empty… like the nearly cloudless sky or a plain white bread.  Anyway I just watched the sky; I didn’t feel like saying anything  more.</p>
<p>We  were quiet for a while. But the silence brought up sad and depressing  memories. Many of them… some of them recent… some were older  ones. But one memory stood out from the rest of them… and it was  Ootori’s kiss.</p>
<p>The  shuddering feeling of dread when I heard the first three words, “I  like you…” I wanted to hear someone say that to me and of course  the way Hikari did so before doesn’t count. But I never thought  Hikari’s girlfriend would be the first to say it to me… full of  that desire and passion that any girl had dreamed and wished for. I  don’t even remember what she said after those words. The kiss  though… I didn’t struggle from as much as my rationality really  wanted. I clearly remember letting her kiss me as tears of… dare I  admit it… joy fell from my eyes. I was happy that someone liked me  enough to do that… even if it was Ootori.</p>
<p>Who  would have thought my first kisses would be so memorable. I sighed  and was about to take out another stick when I noticed that she was  staring at me.</p>
<p>No…  not staring exactly… she had this absent look in her eyes like she  was thinking of something deep. I moved closer to her to check if she  was indeed not looking at me, just at my direction. “Hmmm…”</p>
<p>I  looked straight into her eyes… my face inches from her. If someone  saw us this would be in the bulletin board by tomorrow morning. But I  can’t possibly get anymore attention that I already want… or  don’t… and decided to do it anyway.</p>
<p>After  a few seconds, I noticed her eyes began taking notice of me before  almost jumping away in surprise. Seeing that she I had her attention  now, I decided to ask, “Are you ok? You look more troubled than I  do.” It was an expression of course… I can’t exactly tell how  troubled I look.</p>
<p>She  nodded and said, “I’ll be alright.” I looked at her once more  before moving away. I sat down, closer to her… I just felt too lazy  to move to far.</p>
<p>We  sat in a long silence again… that was when I felt strange. To be  more exact my stomach did. I curled up subconsciously maybe I thought  that doing so would reduce the pain I felt.</p>
<p>Then…  I just blacked out.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When  I woke up, I was drenched in a cold sweat; my stomach ached and was  incredibly dizzy. I struggled to get out of bed and rush out to a  nearby lavatory. But my balance failed me… and I found myself  crashing on the next bed with my hand on my mouth struggling to keep  whatever it was that wanted to come out through my mouth down.</p>
<p>I  soon heard footsteps and heard the familiar voice of the school’s  regular nurse, Anegasaki Tae. “Nanto-san? How do you… hang on for  a few more seconds!” she immediately rushed somewhere. She came  back three to five seconds later with a bucket, a good quarter of  filled with water and some sanitary chemical, and placed it right in  front of my face. And as if on cue I blew chunks.</p>
<p>A  few excruciating and disgusting minutes later, it all came out… I  must have regurgitated everything I ate, breakfast included.</p>
<p>“What  have you been eating?” she asked with a not so exaggerated gasp.</p>
<p>I  didn’t answer and just looked at the bucket, which was full of  something blackish brown and disgustingly bubbly, hoping that was  everything.</p>
<p>“How  do you feel?”</p>
<p>I  gave her a look… I’m not quite sure what kind exactly but it was  the best I could do with all my cheekiness and dignity drained out of  me for the time being.</p>
<p>“Sorry…  but really how or what do you feel?” she placed a hand on my  forehead to check my temperature as she asked, which I know was  partly concern but mostly because it was her job.</p>
<p>“I  feel like I ate a bunch of nearly expired sushi, drank soy sauce  green and slimy with wasabi and someone punched my gut making me do  it over again in one swallow.” I grimly described with all the gore  and cheekiness I could muster.</p>
<p>She  smiled and said, “If you can joke like that… I’m sure you can  make a complete recovery… in less than a day, probably a few hours  if you can get something proper to eat.”</p>
<p>I  rolled my eyes and said, “I hope so...” meaning something  completely different from my physical health.</p>
<p>“The  small fever you had while you were out is gone too.” She added as  she walked to the clinic sink to wet a clean towel and hands it to  me.</p>
<p>“I  had a fever?” I asked.</p>
<p>She  laughed a little and told me not to worry because it wasn’t high  and would be gone if I could get more rest. She then went away to  dispose of the bucket or to be more precise it’s contents. I laid  back down on the bed after wiping my face with a wet towel she handed  to me earlier. And I then wondered… how did I get there.</p>
<p>The  last that I could remember was that I was with Ootori back by the  lake… I felt pain then… I’m guessing I fainted or fell asleep.</p>
<p>The  nurse then returned with the bucket and a fresh batch of the water  solution which she placed somewhere safe and close by.</p>
<p>And  before she could say anything I asked her, “How did I get here?”</p>
<p>“Well  about two hours ago… I heard someone knocking by, what I would  guess, using one’s foot.” I was having a hard time imagining  Ootori doing some like that but I allowed her to continue. “When I  opened the door I found you cradled in Ootori Amane’s arms like a  princess.” I almost cringed at the image that crept up my thoughts…  Ootori’s Princess was one of the last things I’d want to be. “She  told me that one moment the two of you were sitting somewhere the  next she noticed you’ve fainted and she rushed to bring you here.”</p>
<p>“I  see.” I inwardly thanked Ootori for telling only enough detail to  explain how it came to be that she was the one that brought me there.</p>
<p>“Seeing  the two of you like that was so dreamy…” she looked a little  dazed like her mind was heading somewhere far away.</p>
<p>I  rolled my eyes again this time holding my tongue not that she’d  probably hear what I said. After a few minutes she regains herself  and tells me to rest for a while longer or if I wanted I could sleep  and she’d wake me when classes were officially over. I nodded and  decided to rest for a little bit more.</p>
<p>But  after a few minutes of lying down my stomach decided to lessen my  dignity even further and let out a loud and very distinctive growl.  Nurse Anegasaki held her laughter, for which I was almost grateful…  almost because she laughed loud and hard when my stomach repeated the  act five seconds later.</p>
<p>To  save face, I immediately stood up straighten up my uniform and  proceeded to walk out the door while she was busy laughing. But  before I could fully open the door she stopped me and said,  “Wait!!... Don’t forget your jacket.” as she pointed at the  hanger rack by the door. I took it and put it on immediately. I  walked out and half slammed the door behind me only to hear her still  laughing inside.</p>
<p>Deciding  that the best way to remedy this situation was to get something to  eat, and not berate the nurse, I quickly headed to the cafeteria for  a snack.</p>
<p>About  two minutes later, I was about two halls away from the cafeteria when  my eye spied a certain pink haired girl. I must not have been  thinking straight as I didn’t do anything to avoid her seeing me.</p>
<p>“Yaya-sa..senpai!”  she called out, trying to hide her mistake of calling me san with a  bright innocent smile.</p>
<p>“Hi…  Tsubomi...” I said raising my hand to give her a sort of hand wave  that I’m sure didn’t look quite right. “I’m in a hurry. I’ll  see you later.” I said as I continued to walk not bothering to wait  for her to respond.</p>
<p>“But  senpai!... where…?” her question died in the air as my stomach’s  growl echoing in the empty hall. “… oh…” was the only thing  she could say but it was evident with her wide eyes that it surprised  her.</p>
<p>And  then another event of me not thinking straight was when I said these  words… “Would you like to join me?”</p>
<p>She  blushed and nodded before walking up to me and joining my pace  towards the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Minutes  later, we shared a table… my side full of food as if I had not  eaten in days. I was about to put the third piece of BLT sandwich  into my mouth when I noticed that Tsubomi looked like she wanted to  say or ask something. And against a wiser judgment I said to her,  “What’s on your mind Tsubomi?”</p>
<p>She  swallowed nervously and audibly… she looked away from left to right  for a moment probably pondering if she should speak her mind or if  someone was there to listen in. Then she looked down and just said,  “It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>I  should have let the conversation die there but I was obviously not  myself today for I told her, “Spit it out already.” before taking  a big bite of sandwich.</p>
<p>Pouting  a little she looked at me like a child being forced to take a bath or  do a chore she hates… but then she gave me a sad look and asked,  “You know I love you right?”</p>
<p>I  choked… right then the bits of bacon decided to teasingly enter my  left lung while a piece of tomato the right and what I’m sure was a  big piece of lettuce stuck quite near my tonsils. I immediately took  hold of glass of water I had place beside my tomato soup and downed  it all in a few gulps then releasing a relieved sigh.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry…” she said looking down and depressed again.</p>
<p>There  was a part of me that wanted to tell her off and scold her especially  after the short suffering induced by a sandwich, but giving  consideration to her feelings and myself to blame for telling her to  just say what she wanted… it was partially my fault. “It’s ok…  ahem.” I coughed a little as a result of human reflex.</p>
<p>I  looked at her and tried to think of something to say. I know that  she’s resolved to get the two of us together… she has told me so  more than twice before. Her methods are questionable though… After  all I had told her straight that I cannot return her feelings.</p>
<p>… Nothing  came to mind and I proceeded to continue eating. She looked  desperate, I felt sorry for her… but of course I did not want to  encourage her behavior. I don’t want to deepen her heartache… but  I can’t think of anything that will discourage her from pursuing me  without breaking her heart. “You know, Tsubomi… that I don’t  feel the same for you…”</p>
<p>“But!-”  she tried to say something but I immediately silenced her with a  gesture.</p>
<p>“Now  I just want to tell you that if you’ve really set your heart and  sights for me… I won’t argue anymore. But acting like this… and  thinking I’m just about yours already isn’t really going to  change my mind.” I said to her with a soft calm voice.</p>
<p>“Then…  how?” she asked, her voice sounding quite desperate.</p>
<p>I  answered as best as I could without sounding inclined to break her  heart or encourage her to pursue her feelings for me. “I don’t  know… maybe you just have to be yourself? We’re great friends  even though we don’t always act like it… we get along well  enough…”</p>
<p>“And  maybe that will deepen for you someday?” she asked, almost  carefully.</p>
<p>Shrugging  my shoulders and gave her a ‘one can only hope’ smile as I kept  my eyes on her face as I said on word, “Maybe…”</p>
<p>“Was  that how you fell for Hikari-senpai?” she asked looking sad,  curious and with a hint of guilt… as if it was it was the most  scandalous topic in the whole world.</p>
<p>I  shook my head and said, “No…” with a soft, happy and proud  smile.</p>
<p>She  bent her head to the side, her eyes looking straight towards mine.  “Then how?”</p>
<p>I  smiled as I looked at her. Recalled the feeling that hit me the day  Hikari and I met. There were no words to describe how I felt that  day... I’d have to be a great poet or writer to even try… I  decided not to answer her.</p>
<p>Seeing  my silence she asked, “It was love at first sight. Wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>All  I could do was nod.</p>
<p>She  smiled… she seemed impressed or touched by the thought of a love at  first sight. But then she frowned, looked down again and said, “I’m  envious of her.”</p>
<p>I  smiled and told her, “I’m envious of you.”</p>
<p>“EH?!”  She exclaimed and looked at me with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>My  smile widened and I could feel my heart and cheeks warm up as I said,  “I wish I could have just told Hikari how I felt when I had the  chance…” paused and mentally berated myself with a short ‘You  know you had a lot of them before!’ speech in my head before  continuing, “and what ever her answer may be, still continue being  her friend. And if she rejects me; I’d tell her that I haven’t  given up on her and still show her how much I love her.”</p>
<p>She  blushed again… and I’d believe I had just given her a complement  then, and I hoped she took it as such. We were quiet for a while and  I was able to continue my meal. But when I had to get a fresh helping  of water, returned and saw that she had not move… I felt worried  for a moment. At least until she spoke again.</p>
<p>“So  have you picked a club to join yet?” she asked as she looked away.</p>
<p>“Huh?”  I heard the question but the long and uneasy silence had temporarily  dulled my response time.</p>
<p>She  looked anxious and had a tendency to wiggle from left to right. “Well  you know… You quitted the saintly chorus and I was just wondering  what you’re doing?” she was slowly starting to look and sound  like the Tsubomi I knew before I took her to that weekend outing.</p>
<p>“Oh…  I’ve become involved with Chikaru’s project for the festival.”  I could feel that I smiled warmly inside as I politely answered her  question. I know she still felt quite awkward, but I deeply  appreciated that attempted to try shifting her methods… that is if  that’s what she’s trying to do. I said a little uninterestedly.</p>
<p>“Really?  Is it a Lulim school project?” her voice hinting excitement.</p>
<p>“More  like a club thing.” I shrugged after I answered.</p>
<p>“What  are you all doing for the festival?” she asked, her eyes brimming  with curiosity.</p>
<p>“Hmm…  I’m not sure if it’s ok to tell. I’ll have to ask Chikaru, she  might be planning to surprise everyone.” I told her.</p>
<p>Then  we exchanged insults… starting from me being stingy and somehow  ended with her being born with a tomato colored cheek. Before we  laughed like we never had laughed before. It almost felt like we were  back to how it was two weeks ago… Bickering and annoying each  other’s heads off. I know I enjoyed those days... Tsubomi’s  company had always been my recluse from my feelings for Hikari. The  times where we yelled at each other were probably the only moments of  my days that my mind could not keep a picture of Hikari.</p>
<p>We  spent the rest of the time while I was eating to talk, she avoided  topics and things that might lead to a conversation about what  happened between us. And for that I’m very grateful. Instead she  focused on asking other things about me and telling me more about  herself. I found myself smiling inside… and almost saying, “I  just might.” to her out loud.</p>
<p>I  then checked the wall clock and learned that it had been about twenty  or thirty minutes since I came here with her. And just a few more  minutes before class officially ends and everyone will move to their  clubs. And I should get going to Lulim soon…</p>
<p>“Ne…  Tsubomi do you mind telling Hikari to bring my bag to the dorms with  her?” I asked, sounding a little more pleasant than usual.</p>
<p>“I  could just bring it myself if you want.” She suggested to me… But  I was sure that she was curious as to why I had asked when our  classroom was just a hall and a staircase away.</p>
<p>“Either  way is fine.” I said, hoping that would be the end of that topic.</p>
<p>“Ok…  but… why don’t you get it yourself?” she asked and I noted that  I was glad I anticipated the question early enough to think of a  decent lie.</p>
<p>“I  just don’t feel like climbing the stairs a-…” I found myself  hanging there for a second… <em>‘and  I don’t really want to see Hikari, or the other way around, right  now…’</em> the words I wanted no one to hear.</p>
<p>“…if  I can avoid it.” It wasn’t that bad or unbelievable a lie, I  think I sounded lazy enough to pull the words off. But the truth was  I had a feeling that Hikari would want to come and follow me to  Lulim, especially today since the saintly chorus wouldn’t be  meeting and since I believe I heard that the actors for the dorm’s  play were suppose to attend a meeting today. I had reasons not to  want to see Hikari, which is funny since I’ve always made anything  a reason to see her… where did the good times go?</p>
<p>“…” she  was silent for a moment and evidently scrutinizing my face. It looked  like she wasn’t going to believe me. But then she shrugged and  smiled. “Ok then…”</p>
<p>I  smiled thankfully and stood up to clean up the dishes I used. But  before I could head off… she said, “But what should I say if she  asks me where you are?”</p>
<p>I  turned back to her and answered, “Tell her that I was in a hurry  and you’re not really sure where… It’s almost the truth  anyway.”</p>
<p>She  frowned at that, probably noting to herself that she didn’t see me  as a person who could lie to the one I had feelings for. But she  nodded anyway giving me a soft, “Ok.”</p>
<p>“Thanks!  I’ll see you later.” I then turned and surrendered my dished to  be washed. I then headed for the door only to look back at Tsubomi  who was now half way out of the door opposite of the one I was about  to use. I was glad that she decided not to look back before she left  the cafeteria because I was not sure I could forgive myself if she  had a frown on her face.</p>
<p>Making  my way towards Lulim wasn’t difficult. It was probably about ten to  fifteen minute walk depending on one’s pace. I was on my way to the  music room that Chikaru had invited me to when I had this weird  “being watched” feeling. And for someone like me who was used to  getting looked at, because I was more on stage enough thanks to the  saintly chorus, this certainly felt weird and different. I wondered  if it was because I wasn’t in my own school or that maybe those lot  of days that I had not attended the choir made me feel less  impervious to this feeling.</p>
<p>But  as I was wondering this, I felt someone touch me with one finger from  behind. Normally that wouldn’t faze me, but… in this new  environment, new situation, the more or less awkward situation with  Tsubomi and Hikari… and the fact that who ever it was behind me had  coincidentally touched one few sensitive spots of my back that-  completely freaked me out.</p>
<p>And…  the only thing my instinct told me to do was to…</p>
<p>“<strong>IIIIIIIIIIIIIYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!”</strong></p>
<p>… scream.</p>
<p>Very  surprised and scared senseless to the point that I had panicked and  had somehow completely forgotten how to properly take a step, or how  to keep my balance at all, because when I tried to turn towards who  ever it was behind me I found myself falling painfully on my backside  cringing a little as it stung me a bit on the cold tile floor. And I  almost surprised myself for not yelling the pain out.</p>
<p>“Yaya-san!  Are you alright?”</p>
<p>I  heard and recognized the voice, looked up and saw that my guess was  right. “Chi-ka-ru…-san” I slowly muttered each syllable, I  almost regretted doing so as there was so much pain in the tone of my  voice.</p>
<p>She  knelt in front of me, worry written in thick bold letters in face.  “Where does it hurt?” she instinctively posed her hands in front  of me- completely unsure of what to do just yet.</p>
<p>“My  butt… but I’m pretty sure I didn’t break anything, except a  little piece of my pride.” I said jokingly, though my voice still  had a big hint of pain in it when I did.</p>
<p>Chikaru  smiled, she seemed quite relieved to hear me joke about my pride when  she was more worried about my physical well being.</p>
<p>I  looked at my behind instinctively… not a lot of people can look  behind them and see their own backside- or at least not that far.  When I turned my head back to face Chikaru I almost let out a yelp in  surprise when I saw her face was quite close to mine. She had this  smile that I don’t think anyone has ever deciphered or translated  its meaning… I wondered if she could teach me how to do that.</p>
<p>“Chikaru-?”  I called out to her when her gaze was taking too long and started  making me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I  can see why so many have set their eyes on you.” Her voice was  unusually soft and almost seductive that I was almost glad my butt  hurt enough that I didn’t shiver from the tone of her voice. I  swear her voice sound electrifying.</p>
<p>“Excuse  me?” I managed to mumble out without getting my quickening heart  beat to sound with my voice.</p>
<p>But  instead of answering she stood up straight and offered me her hand.  It wasn’t most excellent of evasions, I haven’t decided whether  I’d like to continue or let the topic die… but then again I don’t  even want to think about where the subject would lead to. I took her  hand and stood up, dusting and straightening my uniform as soon as I  regained my balance. I then turned towards her and opened my mouth,  my mind half heartedly set on following up the previous topic- when,  she quickly motioned herself behind me and playfully pushed me to the  direction of the music room.</p>
<p>The  rest of the meeting and practice goes without a hitch. Chikaru was  the most patient of tutors, Remon and Kizuna seemed to have this way  of properly rooting for a person- because I felt quite motivated the  whole time. I made a whole lot of mistakes with my notes, the two  extra cords that a violin didn’t have was a big change… not to  mention the size, weight of the instrument, and my freshly injured  fingers... But it was quite fun and the best part was… Hikari  didn’t come into my mind the whole time.</p>
<p>One  thing though- almost during the whole time I was in Lulim I felt that  weird feeling of being watched. I’m not sure whether I was  imagining it or something but it has not proved itself harmful to me  in anyway, just barely becoming an irritation… so I decided not to  tell Chikaru or anyone about it. I don’t wanna risk embarrassing my  self if it’s just my imagination.</p>
<p>Chikaru  had told me that I could leave first, but somehow I just wanted to  delay the day or at least the part where I return to the dorm if at  least for a while longer… so I volunteered to stay and clean up. I  soon learned why she told me to leave first though… you see,  although Lulim students are quite open to students from Spica and  Miator, it seems that some of their teachers aren’t. And I had a  front seat view of a lecture of the rules of Lulim… all forty five  minutes and twenty nine seconds of “the Lulim school rules (video  edition)”. I am now unable to use the “Ignorance: excuse. And  also I have a new found respect for Lulim Students, in particular can  now be seen in a different light through my eyes, Chikaru, their  student president especially… after all if they can have all that  fun and seem so free with all those rules, they deserve my respect  and adoration! I’m so glad I chose St. Spica.</p>
<p>Anyway…  I was lucky to return to an empty dorm room. If Tsubomi had indeed  brought my bag then she’ll either deliver it later or I’ll have  to pick it up at her room. And I’m hoping it’s the later…  anything to spend less time alone with Hikari. I can act it out all I  want… and I believe I can do it, but it’s quite painful even  though I’ve accepted it already.</p>
<p>I  decided to take a bath- I mean after all that sweat one can work up  playing an instrument, especially one as big and heavy as a guitar, I  can only imagine what kind of person doesn’t take one as soon as  ones able.</p>
<p>The  water stung my hands and it did little to dull the pain in my heart.  Minutes passed somehow I just didn’t feel like leaving the shower  at all, because for the next ten or something minutes I did nothing  but lean on the wall and watched the water that passed the drain. I  soon realized that I was doing something relatively stupid when the  warm water began to pass through my eyes and made them itch. I, of  course, scratched them and lightly cursed at my own stupidity before  getting out of the shower.</p>
<p>It  would have surprised me that Hikari wasn’t back yet, but I didn’t  notice it until I was dressed and my eyes stopped feeling so  irritated. I did some homework, playing the music that Chikaru had  lent to me, while waiting for dinner.</p>
<p>Hikari  came back just as soon as it was time for dinner. I dared not to ask  where she had been all this time, I figured the less I know... the  less I’d think about her. We headed down for dinner, the earphones  of Chikaru’s player still in my ears with its volume probably loud  enough to block someone calling for me.</p>
<p>Dinner  was uneventful, or should I say… I ignored whatever happened during  dinner, and since no one tapped my shoulder to get my attention…  I’m guessing that nothing that needed my attention really happened  anyway.</p>
<p>After  dinner I decided to get something I’ve been putting off since I got  back from my (our, if I count Tsubomi) weekend outing and that was to  make peace with Amane. Picking up the plainly gift wrapped parcel on  my table, I headed of to the senior’s floor of the building… I  was able to avoid telling Hikari anything about it because she had  chosen that time to take a bath. Though what really surprised me is  having avoided a conversation with her that long, since we entered  the classroom, and considering she was rather hard on me the last  time I avoided her… I immediately shook my head and those thoughts  with it.</p>
<p>I  stood in front of Amane’s room. Oddly… I expected fans who fancy  themselves as her body guards standing outside her door and blocking  everyone who might want to have a conversation with her. Looking  down, I frowned at the package and asked myself if I really wanted to  do this… and the answer was bafflingly uncertain. I did want to  show her that there were no hard feelings, but at the same time I  didn’t want her to feel close to me or something relatively close.  I can’t explain it… and I don’t think I’d want anyone to  explain it to me either.</p>
<p>Anyway,  before I could turn away or something… I knocked; I swear I didn’t  do it! But it was hard to deny that the hand that knocked was  connected to my wrist that was connected to my arm etc… etc…</p>
<p>And  soon enough I heard foot steps coming from the inside then soon after  that- “yee… Yaya-sama?!” Amane almost yelled out the honorific  in surprise when she saw me standing outside her door.</p>
<p>Embarrassment,  that I didn’t know was even there, and uncertainty was pushed aside  when my temper flared a bit when she called me with such a high  honorific. “Again… what’s with you calling me that…?” I  yelled, not quite loud enough to be heard by the neighbors but quite  enough to have a mean angry tone.</p>
<p>“Ah…  eh… It’s a sign of my complete and outmost respect for you…?”  I wondered why her statement sounded more like question, but I  decided to let it slide for now.</p>
<p>“Anyway…  Here.” I raised the hand that held the gift and offered it to her.</p>
<p>“What’s  this?” She asked completely awestruck.</p>
<p>I  didn’t really notice that I had a blush on my cheeks until later…  but I knew I was a little embarrassed to be giving her this present.  “It’s a peace offering and a thank you!... for helping me earlier  this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“It  was nothing… I just did what anyone would do.” She said as she  tentatively took the present from me with one hand while the other  scratched her cheek in a sheepish sign of humility. And humility had  got to be one of the things I thought wasn’t part of her character  or at least she wouldn’t openly show it like she’s doing so right  now.</p>
<p>“…” I  wasn’t really sure why but I didn’t like it. I didn’t like  seeing parts of her that made me think there was more to her than  just being ‘Spica’s Prince’, ‘The School Idol’ and ‘the  one who took Hikari away from me.’ I wanted to hate her, ignore  her, and show her that not everyone loves her… but what was the  point? Doing so would only make Hikari dislike me, it would require  some effort to actually show someone you hated them, and maybe I just  didn’t like hating people… a childhood friend of mine said it was  bad for one’s karma.</p>
<p>But  I’m sure that I don’t want to get any closer to her. That much at  least I will put an effort to starting now. I looked at her again,  bowed lightly and said; “Well… a have goodnight.” With that I  quickly turned and walked away. But as I did I suddenly felt  splitting headache and lost my balance. I heard her voice sometime in  that moment, but I didn’t have the time or I just wasn’t  listening as I was expecting to meet the floor and was I bracing  myself for the imminent impact with the floor.</p>
<p>It  never came. Instead I found myself in her arms… again.</p>
<p>“Ootori…”  I muttered without thinking.</p>
<p>She  blushed… then I felt I did too. She tried to look away, her face  marked with a guilty blush and her voice laced with the meekness that  I’ve heard in only one other person... “Are you ok? How are you  feeling?”</p>
<p>I  tried to force nod, but instead my hands shot up to my head and tried  to ease my own physical suffering. I could help but let out a hiss in  pain and a silent curse to the incredibly bad timing of the ailment.</p>
<p>Amane  helped me up to my feet and half carried half dragged my back into  her room… I unfortunately was not in the condition to resist. She  laid me down on her bed, which I was sure didn’t smell the least  bit like her… but it being the only bed in the room ruled out the  possibility that it’s wasn’t her bed.</p>
<p>She  knelt on the floor and critically watched my face with an unhidden  expression of worry on hers. After what seemed like an eternity of  pain… the headache eased and so did the tension I sensed from her.  “How are you feeling?” She asked in a soft tone of voice.</p>
<p>Rage  burned in me as soon as the pain disappeared. I wasn’t sure why,  but I was angry… at her and without thinking I said, “I don’t  need your help!” my voice sounded screechy and I couldn’t help  but looked away.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry.” she guiltily whispered.</p>
<p>I  said nothing and tried to sit up on my own.</p>
<p>“I…  never meant to hurt or insult your pride.” She humbly said looking  at me with guilt and worry.</p>
<p>“!”  It was then that I realized why I was so angry. I didn’t want to  appear weak to anyone… especially Hikari and her. It also explained  my hesitation into coming to see her. A rough and uncertain, “Mmmm…”  was all that I could give as a sure response.</p>
<p>“I’m  a fan of yours. I love going to your recitals and choir concerts.”  Her words sounded passionate and all but something told me it wasn’t  true.</p>
<p>“It’s  mandatory for all students...” And even worse yet I surprised  myself that I played along with her lie. Well I can’t truly be sure  if it is a lie on gut feeling alone… but it did irritate me.</p>
<p>She  reasoned back saying, “It’s a luxury to me!” with enough zeal  that it almost sounded convincing.</p>
<p>“…” and  I didn’t know what or how to react to that. I was silent for a bit…  my brewing anger faded all that was left was confusion and  embarrassment. I looked away, I was sure my cheeks were quite red and  warm. “…why are you telling me this.”</p>
<p>I  felt her smile, I don’t know why but I’m quite sure she did.  “It’s the only way I can say that I…”</p>
<p>And  suddenly I felt like I knew what was coming and to prevent more  embarrassment or weird feelings… I turned to her, my eyes now too  held the warmness that was spreading to the rest of my face, and  yelled out, <strong>“Wait!  Don’t you dare say it!”</strong></p>
<p>She  stopped, smiled at me with her eyes glowing of mischief that you  never thought would look good on her… until you see it. Looking at  me straight in the eyes, the timid and apprehensive Amane was no  where to be found. She leaned forward, just a tiny bit… a masterful  touch I tell you and finished her sentence, “…Like you.”</p>
<p>My  heart raced… and I cursed out loud, turned my head away from her to  hide what ever color it was that my face had taken up. “I told you  not to say it…” I scolded her, my with teeth grit together but my  tone probably wasn’t at all near convincing. I cursed myself  silently, I hated that she made me feel this way. She wasn’t even  my type.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry.” Her apology sounded rehearsed, like she had played it over  a hundred times in her mind, chose the best tone and feeling that  accompanied it before it came out from her mouth.</p>
<p>But  even so… it made my heart beat unsteadily. I really hated that she  made feel this way… I mean why her?! Of all people! Tsubomi I’d  be ok with… Hikari I’d be so happy I could probably die… all  those silly fans of mine I’d even consider- but Ootori?... I don’t  know what to feel.</p>
<p>Feeling  that my blush had eased a little I turned to her, but just enough for  me to see her from the corner of my eye, and examined the expression  on her face. I frowned, seeing that the guilt and truthfulness that I  heard from her voice was nowhere near her face. And with a harsh, “No  you’re not.” I tried to save what little pride I had left in her  eyes.</p>
<p>It  disappointed me that she wasn’t the least bit affected by my stern  retort. Instead she smiled, no grinned, playfully at me and said,  “hmmm… Half?” in tone so mischievous I was beginning to wonder  if this really was Ootori Amane.</p>
<p>She  leaned closer… and instantly I began to worry. An instinctively  bite on my lip… paused her advance but only for a very short  moment, which would have surprised me if I had not thought she’d  feel even a bit guilty of what she was doing. “I’m going to kill  you…” I wanted to declare the outrage I felt, and I never meant  those words more than today... But those same words kept dying behind  my throat.</p>
<p>Her  hand reached out and cupped my cheek, gently urging me to face her. I  did so… but I could have sworn I told my body not to budge. In a  few heart choking seconds… there her eyes were… in front my own.  Staring at me with the deviousness that… I never thought she could  pull off.</p>
<p>She  leaned even closer… and I knew what was about to happen next. I  didn’t want it to happen. But my body wouldn’t listen to me.</p>
<p>My  eyes closed, on its own, and I realized that my body wanted this… a  part of me, a strong part of me, wanted this. There was something  about the way she made me feel that my body wanted… and I think she  knew that, and that is why she was able to keep up this strong and  courageous charade. I tried to muster my will to lash out to her,  anything at all… it didn’t even have to make sense, so long as  it’ll confuse her and stop her from doing what I feared she was  going to do.</p>
<p>But  nothing came- my voice just wouldn’t come at my will… my body  didn’t listen and fate decided nothing would stop her.</p>
<p>I  could feel her closeness... her lips just almost touching mine. Her  breathing tickled my skin. And the scent of lemon soap that  surrounded the air she occupied filled my lungs. I swallowed, or my  body did… god knows that I have lost control of my body moments  ago.</p>
<p>She  kissed me, softly… with the tenderness that I dream someone would  give me or I’d give Hikari. Her lips caressed mine, sensually  warming them and coating them lightly with her taste. My left eye  opened and immediately closed shut, not wanting to believe how  beautiful she looked right then. A free hand lightly rubbed the full  of my back- gently, teasingly, sensually... The hand that cupped my  cheek had moved up, and gently brushed into my hair… I never  thought such a simple act could feel so incredible.</p>
<p>The  kiss gave me a mix of heaven and hell. Heaven because it had felt so  wonderful… hell because I hated that I enjoyed a kiss from her. And  when she started withdrew... I hated the part of me that kissed her  back and stopped her. Yes, I kissed her! And when I found myself  slipping my tongue into her mouth to deepen the kiss, I wanted to  bite it off… right then and there. But I didn’t…</p>
<p>I  felt lost… my kiss was a misplaced passion, misplaced because I  didn’t want to feel passion for her. And it ate at me, gnawing at  my soul daring to rip out my heart.</p>
<p>Our  lips parted… and as much as it pains me to admit it most of the  effort of doing so was hers. I slowly opened my eyes and watched as  she slowly withdrew from me and stood up from the bed. I noticed,  thought it was barely discernible, that she had difficulty keeping  herself balanced… and it would have made me smile, had she not been  who she was.</p>
<p>I  was somehow able to regain some of my control and composure. Although  I wasn’t quite sure if it was enough… but I decided to risk it  anyway. I had to get out of there. My happiness and Hikari’s was in  the balance. I will not be a part of the reason Ootori breaks her  heart!</p>
<p>My  legs moved and my feet had landed on the floor. I praised myself  inwardly. It almost feels like I had lost control of them for so long  and I’m so happy to gain them back.</p>
<p>Next,  my hands and knees helped me up to my feet. I nearly smiled when my  eyes saw the bewildered look on Ootori’s face. Then before my body  gets the chance to betray me again, I stalked out of her room-  mumbling, “I have to go…” in a grungy voice.</p>
<p>A  hand that I was sure I was controlling grabbed the knob of her door  and twisted it opened then I walked out. I did not give her the  chance to react as I slammed the door behind myself loud enough that  I’m sure a neighbor or two heard it.</p>
<p>I  found myself taking deep breaths, my face still felt flashed from the  enrapturing kiss we shared and my heart still beat in it’s unstable  pace.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry.” I heard her say to the door. Part of me wanted to say  something and it was that same annoying part that kissed her earlier.  I didn’t give her a reply.</p>
<p>I  looked around, and was almost relieved that no one decided to bother  checking on who slammed who’s door. Taking a step, a slow pace at  first before quickly increasing into a soft sprint I rushed away from  the senior’s floor.</p>
<p>Where  my feet took me surprised me. Room 119… Tsubomi’s room. I’ve  never been here before… I just know the room number. But why I was  here, was simple… I had to erase Ootori from my body or at the very  least, erase the feeling her kiss gave me.</p>
<p>I  raised my hand and hesitantly knocked. The response was nearly  instant. Tsubomi let out a kind yell, “Just a second! I’ll be  right there.” I never was quite literal with that statement myself…  but oddly today I found myself counting just how many seconds it was  going to take her to open that door.</p>
<p>I  reached twenty two before Tsubomi opened the door with surprised  gasp. “Yaya-sem…-” she looked around the halls before,  “Yaya-san, is something wrong?”</p>
<p>My  body reacted and let out a seemingly forced half smile. It made me  feel good that she was able to somehow determine that something was  wrong without me telling her. And for now I needed something from her  and I didn’t have the time to explain it. I grabbed her wrist and  gently dragged her out of her own room with only a quick, “Come  with me.” were my only instructions.</p>
<p>She  came, without the least bit of a struggle. I escorted her out of the  building and into the dorm’s garden. I searched for a blind spot…  anywhere that we wouldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>I  pushed her behind a tree and held her tight. She lets out a soft  gasp, but her voice didn’t hide her surprise. She looked up to me;  her lemon colored eyes nervously shook and glistened in the bright  moon light, her face flushed a shade darker than her sakura colored  hair, and her usually pale and unpainted lips looked quite delicious  and pink as a pale red rose. I could feel our hearts beat faster from  where our breasts touched. My hands moved and found hers, entwining  each finger around hers.</p>
<p>I  leaned down and said, “I have a lot to explain and maybe apologize  for… but for now-” I paused… I could barely hold myself. I  wanted to, No, I needed to kiss her so badly. I swallowed the knot  that formed in my throat and continued “-for now, I need you.”</p>
<p>I  immediately closed the gap between us and crashed my lips onto hers  into a deep rough and passionate kiss. And to my surprise she wasted  no time and immediately kissed me back with nearly the same vigor.</p>
<p>I  could feel my body exhibiting the same passion and similar emotions I  felt minutes ago in Ootori’s room. No one could possibly imagine  the relief I felt in my heart when I felt them stronger at Tsubomi’s  presence and hands. I let myself go and kissed Tsubomi in a way that  I’ve only dreamt of kissing one girl. I devoured her, savored her  taste, pushed her out, and tasted her again before consuming her once  more. It was a mind numbing kiss that simply turned one’s whole  body into gelatin… and by the time we finished I think I forgot how  to stand.</p>
<p>The  kiss ended mutually. Our breaths were deep and hungry just like our  eyes. I watched her lick her lip and couldn’t help but feel  appreciated maybe even loved and not dirty although desired. My hands  let go of hers and found each other on her back, my chin rested on  her shoulder and my ear barely but sinfully touching hers. I wrapped  myself on to her and tried to relax… and I could say she tried to  do the same, but I could feel her stiffen, probably unsure of what to  do next, and her heart race to a really excited pace. A smile broke  out from my lips…</p>
<p>‘This  is where I’d rather be.’ where the exact lines on my head during  those moments; sitting there, with and in Tsubomi’s arms, pinning  her to the tree of an undetermined genus (not that I cared or that it  mattered- for now), enjoying the afterglow of a mind blowing kiss.</p>
<p>Moments  past and the heat of the moment dissipated by the night’s cool  breeze… I decided it was time that I return her to her room. And  the least thing I could do after dragging her out here was to escort  her back all the way- just in case the sister in charge tonight  decided to take her patrol tonight seriously. I stood first and  helped her up, giving her a wordless peck on the cheek. The blush  that had disappeared a while ago had decided to return to her face  with a vengeance… it was so amusingly cute.</p>
<p>We  quietly walked back into the dorm. Luckily, we didn’t run into the  sister in charge and I was saved from partially lying to a servant of  God. When we reached her door… she seemed hesitant to open the door  and enter.</p>
<p>“Tsubomi?”  I called out, a hint wonder and worry wrapped with my voice. She  turned to me and looked like she wanted to say or ask something. And  I’m sure it had something to do within the lines of our  relationship.</p>
<p>I  kissed softly on her forehead and wished her a good night. Giving her  a warm smile I opened her door for her which I gently pushed her  through and sneaked my head in. I asked for my bag, which she  immediately nodded on and turned to her desk to pick up, while my  eyes quickly scanned if her roommate was present and my inner smile  turned to one of mischief when I found that she wasn’t. Tsubomi  returned handing me my bag and in one swift move I opened the door a  touch wider took a small step in and quickly stole a kiss from her  lips.</p>
<p>She  blushed, surprised… I’m sure I wouldn’t have been, but I found  it cute nonetheless.</p>
<p>I  then said to her, “Let’s go out again sometime.” in a soft  secretive whisper and winked my left eye, with held more than enough  mischief that she’d probably have trouble sleeping, before I closed  the door as soon as my head had cleared the door frame.</p>
<p>I  didn’t move at first. Probably I was expecting that she would rush  out and ask questions… but she didn’t. Instead…</p>
<p>“<strong>YES!!!”</strong> I heard her yell out quite loudly.</p>
<p>She  repeated the word about more than a half dozen times, the sound of  her feet landing on the floor with a few dull thumps- a sign of an  excited hop- before a louder thump and some springs which I’d guess  would have been when she jumped on her bed. A snicker escaped my lips  but I was somehow able to maintain control of myself and all that  came out was a sound almost like a soft choke. I quickly made my  escape back to our room.</p>
<p>When  I got to the second floor I was force to wait for a few minutes,  because the sister was lecturing someone at the other end of the  hallway… either for being noisy or some other infraction…</p>
<p>I  sneezed silently. It was then that I realized that I was starting to  feel a little chilled. And of course, I would be considering I was  wearing the smallest of clothes in my dresser. I had not expected to  take too long with my small excursion after all. It was just suppose  to be an apology, gratitude and a gift drop off… but what did I  get? I get molested, technically speaking, by Hikari’s suppose to  be girlfriend no less, which would have been enough of a reason to  kill her… I’ll have to talk to Hikari about her girlfriend’s  “tendencies” if I ever get the chance and courage too.</p>
<p>The  sister was finally done lecturing the occupants of a room and slowly  continued her rounds, which… much to my dismay too longer than I  would have liked it to be. And when she was finally done and moved up  to the third floor rooms I rushed to our room as quietly as possible.</p>
<p>When  I entered Hikari looked at me, her face had questions all over it…  most of them I’m not sure I could answer with honesty. She opened  her mouth to say something but then… I sneeze, loud and strong.</p>
<p>“<strong>ACHOOO!”</strong> suddenly I didn’t feel so good. That headache earlier returned with  a vengeance and now brought some reinforcements in the form of what  I’d say was a cold. I cursed inwardly, feeling stupid for getting  sick…</p>
<p>I  didn’t see Hikari move and only noticed that she was close to me  soon after the first sneeze. She was holding a box of tissues to me  at looking at me with an examining eye. Her lips slowly turned to a  frowned before she said, “I think you have cold, Yaya-chan.”</p>
<p>“Really?”  my voice made it sound like a bad thing… not that it wasn’t. But  was almost funny actually… I was feeling so hot earlier after all,  who would have thought… I’d catch a cold after all ‘that’.</p>
<p>Hikari  leaned closer and placed a hand on my head but quickly lifted it away  then said, “You’re burning up!” she sounded almost lecturing.  Yet for a moment… her comment on what should have been my fever, my  beginning to be delusional brain took as the complement: “You’re  hot!” of course I shrugged the silly thought almost instantly after  I heard my inner voice giggle.</p>
<p>I’m  not exactly sure what happened after that. I couldn’t recall any  memory of what happen between that and finding myself on my bed. The  room was dark, cold and oddly dank. And it made me feel horrible. It  was that hateful feeling of being hot yet at the same time very cold  that I hated from feverish illnesses, colds and the flu most common  of them. I sneezed again… and again and again…</p>
<p>A  lamp from Hikari’s side of the room lit up and I immediately heard  her sheets flying. She rushed to my side with the tissue box on one  hand, which she wordlessly offers for me to use. A very welcome  gesture. I quickly sat up grabbed a few pieces from the box and blew  my nose. I think I swore just then, that this day couldn’t get any  worse but then it donned to me… it was early morning. I swore again  inside, this day could get worse.</p>
<p>With  a sigh I laid back down only to miss my pillow just enough to hit my  head on the head board.</p>
<p>“<strong>IIIITTTAAAAaaaaa….”</strong> I screamed, hissed and winced. Tears of pain daring to trickle from  my eyes as both my hands shot up to the back of my head and tried to  eased the suffering… (Again)</p>
<p>I  heard a giggle, a very soft and muffled giggle. And with no else in  the room… I’m sure it was Hikari. I turned to her and true enough  she was hiding her smile behind the box of tissue. I just looked at  her eyes with a bit of resentment and dropped the issue before it can  begin. My lungs were disgusting, my head ache and my whole body was a  mix of overheating and near clammy cold parts. And I just that didn’t  feel up to lecturing her.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry. Yaya-chan, that was mean of me.” she apologized anyway,  which surprisingly made me think of the pain a touch bit less. She  then moves away and takes something out of the cupboards. I am a bit  surprised when she returns with a glass of…</p>
<p>“Orange  Juice?” I looked at her in disgust. I hated orange juice… I have  no idea why, but I do. I gently placed my hand on hers and tried to  push it away.</p>
<p>“I  know… But it’s good for your cold. I’ll give you some water to  wash it down with after you drink some medicine.” She said in a  calm sweet voice, that I’m sure was all in my head. In my head I  swore and hope the medicine was strong enough to kill the taste of  the orange… because it seems like Hikari wasn’t going to take  “No” for an answer.</p>
<p>I  took the glass from her hand; stared at the tangy looking liquid  inside… and noted with growing disgust that its pulp was still  there. I felt sicker. I turned to Hikari and asked, “Do I really  have to?” in a whiney voice.</p>
<p>She  just looked at me knowingly, trying not to smile at my futile  attempts to get out of drinking the damn thing.</p>
<p>I  sighed in defeat. “Can’t blame a sick girl for trying…” I  looked at the liquid again and summoned all my courage, in one swift  move I place the glass on my lips and did my best to finish the damn  thing with as few gulps as possible before my taste buds kicked in.  And when it was done, Hikari was laughing at my disgusted expression  as I scratched and rubbed my tongue onto my teeth trying to remove as  much of the foul liquid from it.</p>
<p>She  takes the glass and hands me smaller glass that we usually save for  measuring small liquids, like the nearly transparent purplish liquid  medicine in it now. I took it without being told and drank… almost  savoring its taste for it sure tasted better than the orange to me.</p>
<p>“Here’s  some water.” she hands me a small bottle of water, whose contents  was emptied down my throat. She quickly takes the glass and the  bottle from me and tells me to get back to bed. I complied after a  weak and brief nod. Once I had lain down and Hikari had placed the  glasses I had use into our small sink she heads back to her bed and  turns off the light.</p>
<p>I’m  not sure how long my consciousness lingered before I fell asleep. But  hours later… I woke up breaking in a fit of dry and hoarse coughs.</p>
<p>Hikari  rushed to my side, still in her pajamas, with a worried look on her  face. “Yaya-chan?!...” She looked around before asking, “Would  you like some water?”</p>
<p>I  nodded very weakly. I would have preferred some tea or hot milk…  but I didn’t feel up to making a request and was just glad she  didn’t offer the orange juice. She lifts my head a bit and slowly  makes me sip the lukewarm liquid. I gag a little when it passes the  wrong way once in a while but I managed to drink the whole serving.  Hikari then moves away, after gently setting my head back on my  pillow, and I slowly found myself sipping to unconsciousness.</p>
<p>But  before I could, Hikari sakes me awake. I looked at her weakly, one  eye barely opened, she was kneeling on the floor holding another  glass of water and a serving of the medicine again. “Yaya-chan! You  should drink some medicine before going back to sleep.”</p>
<p>I  just shook my head. I didn’t want to drink anymore. But she raised  my head, and placed the glass near my lips. I refused to drink the  medicine. It was hard headed of me… but I didn’t think I could  bare anymore liquid slither down my throat.</p>
<p>My  persistence paid off… Hikari’s voice sounded lecturing and a  touch angry… but I wasn’t really listening. And she took the  glass of medicine away from my mouth. I thanked someone… who in  particular escapes me, but let’s assume its God anyway. But then  something happens that I certainly never saw coming.</p>
<p>Hikari  presses her lips into mine…</p>
