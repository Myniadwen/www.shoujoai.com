<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p>Momomi looked out of the window, resting her head on her hand and smiling. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yeah,  I’m gone in the head. This is overwhelmingly the portrait of a girl in  lov- lust. Lust is safer, and probably more accurate to boot. This is  another one of those many things about my life that has changed very  fast very rapidly, but I’m happy about it. Everything I do with Kaname  is just- fun. That’s about the long and short of it. Especially, well- </span></em>Momomi  clamped down on that thought before she flushed and completely gave  herself away. She schooled her expression into something approaching a  sombre, mature frown, just in case anyone was watching. <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she’s  very cute, if that’s a word that can be applied to Kaname. The gap  between her words and her thoughts, the way she never gives up, never  lets it happen, always verbally fencing with me even when we kiss, I  like it all. She’s something, a paradox, difficult to describe. Strong  and weak at once, always covering her own weaknesses no matter what,  but with care for me even in the heat of her fury. She’s always  dishonest, but that just makes her truth more fascinating. She wants me  and doesn’t at the same time. She’s something I can hold but not seize,  letting me feel comfortable without ever letting me feel secure. She  lets me come on and do everything, but somehow she’s still the one who  feels in control, somehow, for all her fractured feelings. I know I  need her, but even though I know she wants me she’ll hide that badly,  for her dignity. And if I don’t respect her dignity, she’ll step back,  however much it hurts her. That should frighten me, but I find it  exciting. After all, I have advantages as well, starting with the  physical and mental initiative. We aren’t something so static as a  solid, mutual relationship. This is something else, needing and yet  confrontational. In a way, it hasn’t changed since we first met and  argued. It’s something I’ll relish and enjoy, for now. I wonder whether  that’ll ever change?</span></em></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi smirked, watching her shadowy reflection in the window look back at her with amusement. <em>Who knows? Right now, I have only a loose apprehension of the future. That’s fine until I know what the present is. </em>She ran her hands through her hair, adjusting it slightly where Kaname had ruffled it. <em>But  we really are a little contradictory. I remember being so angry with  her, busy in our struggle over such stupid little things, and that was  so amazing frustrating. I couldn’t really believe that she would be so  jealous. But once we’d moved on, we moved on. It’s not like I  apologised, and nor did she. It’s not like we’d concluded the matter in  hand, that’s also beyond people like us. We’re far too stubborn for  that. We just step past the issue, put it behind us, and get on with  things. That’s good, I think. If we had a proper tiff for everything we  hard to argue about, we’d never get anywhere. Like this, things are a  lot easier. And it definitely suits someone like Kaname, who would  rather bang her head against a wall than admit she’s wrong and  apologise. For the most part, anyway. </em>Her fingers traced little loops in the mist of the windows. <em>Either  way, we ended up in each other’s arms. I can’t really stay angry with  her for very long, least of all about the stupid things. It’s easier to  be comfortable and happy. All the same, irritation and affection,  repulsion and fascination, that kind of contradiction… that’s who we  are. To kill and to kiss. Very dramatic. I should write a story about  it sometime. </em>Momomi grinned. <em>But meanwhile, in the land of  sanity, I’ll just enjoy things as they were. I understand Kaname to a  degree, her frustration and jealousy, but she does need to get used to  this stuff. Like this is better than an outright confrontation, and we  can end on a good note too. It’s not like we have to agree on  everything, after all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed at her reflection, smiling wanly. <em>It’s  too bad she’s not more confident, though. But she’s always been the  more insecure one, somehow. I guess I can wait for her, and enjoy this  in the meantime. </em>She returned her attention to the lesson at hand  briefly, only to find that the teacher had gone on a tangent.  Minami-sensei was reliable in that respect, if no other. Right now she  was busy talking with a few of her favourite pupils about the state of  government in Africa. <em>Under those circumstances, I’m definitely  excused from paying attention. Kaname worked me harder, though probably  not as hard as she had intended what with my way to fill the time. It’s  okay, I think. We can worry about that stuff later, but our new  relationship needs lots of work right now. Perhaps. That kinda sounds  like an excuse not to work, though. Albeit not one I’d use on the  teachers. ‘Excuse me, sensei, but can I give you that essay a week  late? I’m practising kissing with my girlfriend. We’re both  inexperienced, you know how it is.’ </em>Momomi rested her chin in her hands, incidentally hiding her mouth. <em>Yeah,  I don’t think that will make the cut. And it won’t work on the  scholarship exam, either. I should probably let her work us harder, but  it isn’t my fault! Working jointly in privacy and close proximity,  eating our lunch together in the gaps, it all screams study date. And  after a while I remember the second bit, while completely forgetting  the first. But that’s perfectly normal, I’m sure of it. And I know  Kaname enjoyed it too, whatever she may say. That’s important as well,  of course. Being happy to be with the one who you can offer  happiness…no wonder people go on about romance. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That’s  what I’d like to say, anyway. The truth is far more complicated, and a  little discouraging, even for me. What does she think of me? Even if we  have the same feelings, are they balanced? Does jealous Kaname like me  more than I like her, or does the Kaname who lets me take control like  me less? Is that a problem, even if that is the case? Am I giving her  too much attention, or too little? Does she enjoy the physical aspects  as much as I do, or does she merely put up with them for my sake? When  we have those arguments, does she let things slide as easily as I do,  or does she bear troubles that she’s too shy or bloody-minded to share  as a result of my casual words? Can this happiness last? How far does  her vision go? Will she get bored of me by the end? Or will I get bored  of her, as my childish infatuation wears off? I know that feelings  which are so concrete in moment can become so much gloop the next,  washed away and replaced by the next novel person. I don’t want to be  that kind of person, but is it really a bad thing? If you experience  that, is there any point in pretending and maintaining a sham of a  relationship, or is it healthier to move on? If that does happen, will  we ruin our friendship? What would I say or do if she did that to me?  And- </em>Momomi smiled and closed her eyes. <em>Okay, too many  questions. And for some reason, looking for those answers from books  and the internet is stigmatised, isn’t it? So I suppose I’ll have to  find all the answers myself. But I’m feeling optimistic now, for all  those doubts. I’m willing to take things as they come.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kiyashiki! Pay attention!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded, trying not to snort. <em>Hypocrite much? </em>She  listened to Minami-sensei drone on and wondered just how interminably  long the minutes would become and how deep in boredom she’d be before  she could finally see Kaname again.<em> Even if you’re in love, some things don’t change. Tedious Geography lessons are definitely immune to Cupid’s spawn camping.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Much  later, Momomi shouldered her bag and headed out, stepping past the  Minami-sensei after school debating society who were crowding around  her desk and throwing their banal opinions in her face. <em>And she likes it! I don’t understand that at all, I admit. </em>She  shrugged the thought away as she walked, along with reflections on the  pain of double Geography in the afternoon. A few people asked her  questions, but she’d mastered the smooth, shallow reply. A whole lot  more stared, and she just enjoyed that. <em>I’ve never been that  self-conscious, unless it’s with Kaname. And I find it very easily to  take this for granted whatever their intentions towards me. It’s  probably in the blood, but it isn’t something I can be proud of.  Especially after Kaname’s rivalry with Amane, and everything she thinks  about that…I don’t want to be like Amane. Which is ridiculous, as  Amane’s so perfect and embodies my own goals anyway. Leaving me in  something of a pickle. Ha, like the pickles she doesn’t eat. She’s  happy with her fundamentalism, but the tough decision, like umeboshi,  falls to me to chew over and swallow. And she’s definitely made things  more complicated, but that’s nothing new. </em>Eventually, she reached the Church, looking round and finding that Kaname had arrived first.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The blue-haired girl nodded, pushing herself off the wall. “Hi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi put a hand on her hip, smiling. “As ever, you’re posing away, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As if you’re any different.” Kaname snorted. “When I first met you, your personality was nothing but pose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve worked on that, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah. Now it’s all poise, which is even worse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi giggled, walking forwards. “You’re very mean, you do know that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“An appeal to pity doesn’t really work when you have an ego the size of the Eiffel Tower.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  must be why you never appeal to pity, then.” Momomi hugged her briefly.  “It’s too bad, as I’d be quite happy to pity my cute Kaname if she  wasn’t so noisy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname’s red eyes flickered slightly, trying to take in anyone who could have seen them. “Momomi…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know.” Momomi sighed. “But hugs are platonic, you know? It’s nothing to be ashamed of.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even so what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname gestured vaguely. “This school is this school. There’s been too many troublesome rumours as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  folded her arms. “You do know that some public displays of affection  would be a good way to resolve some of those rumours, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  so, I have my pride, you know.” Kaname prodded her on the forehead,  smiling slightly. “It’s fine, isn’t it? I’m sure you’ll be able to  struggle through a few more hours without sucking my blood or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  pouted. “That’s easy for you to say, coming straight from French… I had  double Geography. After that, a girl wants some touchy-feely moments  just to remind herself that life’s worth living.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“As dramatic as ever. Well, don’t die on me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should sound more concerned. If I died I would definitely haunt you for all eternity…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  wouldn’t be the first, either.” Shion waved as she crossed the floor,  walking towards them. “But I’m the third here, it appears. That’s  unusual.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “Don’t you have something to do? To do with your precious play, or whatever?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course. I have it in my bag,” Shion replied, slapping it. “I’ll work on  it while you toil away, but that sight is way too funny for me to pass  up, whatever the circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shook her head irritably. “Oh? And are you telling me you never had to do anything like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s a secret,” Shion replied. “I’ll leave you to guess about that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.  Looks like we’ll have to talk to your peers,” Momomi mused. “But from  what I’ve heard of you, you were probably scrubbing floors a lot in  your first year.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not a lot,” Shion replied. “I didn’t get caught as much as you two do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very  convincing,” Kaname muttered dryly. “Well, if you’re experienced, grab  a mop and help out already. Consider it rent for the entertainment we  apparently provide you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, now, Kenjou-kun, it wouldn’t be  right of me to deprive you of part of this important learning  opportunity.” Shion scratched her cheek, grinning widely. “If you acted  badly in the future as a result of that, I’d never forgive myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t  cry yourself to sleep at night about subverting an outdated, tedious  and ineffectual punishment.” Kaname stuck her hands in her pockets,  looking at the ceiling. “Not that big a deal. More importantly, where  the hell are the other two? We can’t start until they get here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Technically, I don’t think that’s true,” Shion observed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Morally,  that is.” Momomi leaned against one of the seats, sighing. “We can’t  deprive them of an important learning opportunity, after all.” She  folded her arms. “What did you mean just now, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You wouldn’t be the first, either. Something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  right.” Shion shrugged. “A throw-away comment, based on my new  research. I’m looking at a very interesting thing right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Kaname asked, disinterest plain on her voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Seven Mysteries of the Strawberry Dorms,” Shion said dramatically, raising a finger.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?  Ghost stories?” Kaname rested her head in her hands. “Give me a break.  Even if she’s dead boring and stalking people is weird, at least  Amane’s weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I’m not actually looking for ghosts,  you know.” Shion sat, resting her bag on her knees. “This is an  exercise in the psychology of our school-fellows. The kind of story  they’re interested in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are Catholics even supposed to believe in ghosts?” Momomi asked dubiously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably  not.” Shion closed her eyes and shrugged theatrically. “But Catholic  girls aren’t supposed to go all the way on a regular basis with another  girl, and that’s our Etoiles. We’re flexible, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To the breaking point,” Kaname said. “This is why atheism is easier. It doesn’t pretend to be internally consistent.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  unlike you to run away from a challenge. But you’re you, after all.”  Shion looked up. “In any case, it’s made for some light relief in  between worrying about homework and the play.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever makes you happy,” Momomi replied.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I was wondering… would it be possible to make a mystery?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname blinked. “Say what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  mysteries are basically good ghost stories based on the Strawberry  Dorms, right?” Shion looked at them enthusiastically. “So if you want  to add a mystery, all you’d have to do is come up with a convincing  ghost story assigned to a good location and spread it. I’d love to see  whether we could actually do that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded slowly. “You know, unlike most of your plans and intentions, that actually makes a twisted kind of sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The  next time we’re not doing anything else, we should definitely do that.”  Shion grinned. “Or whenever inspiration strikes. Wouldn’t that be fun?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t think you can just make an extra story up,” Kaname noted. “It’s  always the seven mysteries, right? That’s stupid in itself, but still,  you take my point.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll just add an eighth, that’s all,” Shion replied easily. “That’ll confuse things even more, which suits me just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ow! Let go of me, already! I can walk, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi looked around and sighed when she saw the origin of this particular non sequitur. “You’re late, you two!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki  stuck her feet against the ground and pulled back, trying to resist  Kariya’s iron grip on her arm. “I said let go! This is abuse of  authority! Assault! Rape!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname sighed and shook her head. “As ever, a graceful entrance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up with the lame sarcasm already!” Amiki snapped. She was finally  released, stepping away and rubbing her arm. “Ow! That really hurt, you  know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m crying,” Kariya snapped. “You’re way too late. And you two should have started as well!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now,  Kariya. It’s okay, isn’t it? They still have plenty of time.” Serané  stood by her partner, Olesa walking demurely by her side. “Besides,  this way things are simpler, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It shows a lazy attitude, though,” Kariya replied, looking at them distastefully. “I don’t approve of that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More importantly, why are you two late?” Kaname demanded. “And why are you with them?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s been a while, Kariya-sama, Serané-sama,” Shion said politely, bowing her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And why did Amiki get dragged while Olesa walked?” Momomi inquired. “That hardly seems fair…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shut  up!” Kariya drew herself up, regarding them with irritation. “You’re  all far too noisy. Remember that this is, and continues to be, a  punishment. And on that note, get to work. You’ll have to miss the  first few minutes of kendo as it is, and it ends up worse than that I  won’t even let you in!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I got it, I got it,” Kaname said. “We’re getting the mops, already! No need to glare!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But seriously, why did you get to walk?” Momomi asked as she walked with Olesa.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was more graceful in complying,” Olesa replied blandly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And why are you late?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something came up. We were discussing it while we walked, then we happened upon them. Mere bad luck.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi stifled a laugh. “I see. That’s too bad. Kariya looks even more pissed than usual, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s understandable.” Olesa shrugged. “Due to circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Circumstances?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“God, you’re so loud! Just shut up and get to work already!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed and got to work, initially in silence. It wasn’t like her to  feel oppressed, but somehow all possible conversation dried up before  it could reach her lips. Instead, she trooped towards the taps, trying  not to look at Kariya. The red girl had folded her arms, fuming  silently. It wasn’t until they’d scurried outside when Momomi found  herself able to breathe again. “What is with that atmosphere? She’s  like super-hyper pissed off right now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think that’s her  killing intent,” Olesa replied seriously. “Well, more properly, her  Kokyu as a practitioner of kendo. It has intimidating properties.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not sure about that…” Momomi muttered, waving a hand vaguely. “But that’s not what I meant, anyway? Why is she so annoyed?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You did?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was… due to circumstances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s not an answer!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They  interrupted a conversation of ours,” Amiki explained, leaning down and  filling her bucket. “But more importantly, we interrupted them, getting  pretty… personal. So she’s all bitchy now. I think it’s to do with  hormone imbalances.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shush, not so loud!” Momomi warned. “If she hears you, we’re all dead!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname frowned. “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not at all,” Olesa remarked, just as Amiki said “Pretty much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  dropped her bucket and stared between them, placing her hands on her  hips. “Now you’re just being confusing! Which is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  right,” the two said at once. They stared at each other in puzzlement,  then Amiki closed her mouth and Olesa sighed. “Amiki’s basically  accurate. We found them kissing. Enthusiastically.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s strange,” Kaname noted. “They never show public affection.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  it wasn’t exactly public.” Amiki stepped back, blushing at a memory.  “It was a private kind of place. We just got really, really unlucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  is that, anyway?” Momomi scratched her cheek. “It’s a little odd,  coming from them. Their not exactly insecure in their relationship, or  lacking in confidence otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably Serané’s demure bearing,” Amiki guessed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or in deference to the reputation of the school,” Olesa suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  sounds like them.” Momomi leaned forwards. “So, where did you find  them, anyway? The Etoile’s favourite make-out spot… we could advertise  it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ask Shion, she probably already knows.” Kaname picked up  her buckets. “In any case, get going before she comes out here and  drags us in there.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, looking down at her empty bucket. “Sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  they returned, Shion was in conversation with the Etoiles. “What a  suicidal girl,” Momomi whispered. “That takes real courage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite.” Kaname grounded her mop. “More importantly, we should get to work.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They  spread out and started. Momomi smiled as she dropped the bucket and  wetted her mop, getting to work. She looked up, glad to see that Shion  had succeeded in moving the irritable Kariya away from them. “You know,  even over this time, I’ve got a lot better. I don’t struggle so much  with the bucket, for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. You’re not there yet.” Kaname snorted. “You’ll lose everything you’ve gained the moment you stop.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? Are you seriously suggesting that we should carry this on after we’re finished with the stuff we absolutely have to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.  But still, that’s the way it is.” Kaname sighed. “Beyond that, washing  floors isn’t something you do much in real life anyway. So it really is  pointless.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, thanks for the morale boost.” Momomi pouted  petulantly. “Wasn’t it better when I thought there was a purpose to the  exercise?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The purpose is to grind us into dust. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi chuckled. “Ever the optimist, my Kaname.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that point aside, it’s been a while, hasn’t it?” Amiki mused. “How long do we have left?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “You knows?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’d  be better if we did know,” Momomi said cautiously. “For all my tough  talk, I don’t want to do this any more than I have to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure we all share that sentiment,” Olesa replied. “But we’re still stuck here for now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, it could be worse, I guess.” Momomi smiled. “At least we don’t hate each other now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Speak  for yourself,” Amiki quipped. “I’m just glad we have kendo, because  otherwise I’d be fighting Kaname already, mop-bo style.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Any time you like,” Kaname retorted. “I don’t much like you either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  sighed and rolled her eyes. “Fine, we don’t genuinely hate each other  now, even if it’s cool to pretend. So much for self-assessment.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The past isn’t too important,” Olesa remarked. “Who are now, and where we stand now, are the things we care about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi blinked, then looked at her carefully. “You’re right, I guess. That’s how it is, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good afternoon, everyone.” Serané smiled at them. “Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re fine,” Momomi said. “Don’t worry about us. It’s Shion who needs rescuing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s  very cheeky,” Serané observed, playfully poking Momomi on the forehead.  “They’re discussing Tomori-san’s play, actually. It sounds like it  should be very interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname groaned. “I should have known… when it comes to self-promotion, she never misses a trick, I’ll give her that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s  just enthusiastic, which is good. I’m looking forwards to it.” Serané  smiled, pushing a wave of blonde hair out of her eyes. “In any case,  I’m sorry for Kari-chan’s anger. It wasn’t strictly deserved, but she’s  had a very hard day.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing important. Just  showing some of our sponsors around, and one of them was the most  frightful bigoted boor…” Serané shrugged. “Well, you aren’t here to  listen to our worries.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Giving a tour, huh?” Momomi shook her head. “You two really do everything, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  more authentic this way, I think.” Serané glanced at Amiki and Olesa,  cocking her head and smiling sweetly. “But an especial apology for you  two. You saw something that we don’t like to show off… and we saw  something we weren’t supposed to see either.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amiki flushed. “No… it’s nothing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?” Momomi’s lips curled into a cunning smile. “What’s this, what’s this? What kind of conversation were they having?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My,  hadn’t you better get on with your cleaning, Kiyashiki-san?” Serané  asked innocently. “If you took too long, Kariya really will be very  irritated. And I don’t want her to be any more agitated right now. Her  life is stressful enough as it is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right, right.” Momomi shook her head mournfully. “You know, Serané-sama, you’re an extremely cruel tease…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh?  Really?” Serané touched her chin thoughtfully with a single finger.  “I’m not sure what it is I did to warrant such a reputation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname just snorted derisively.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané clapped her hands. “In any case, isn’t it a little inefficient to be working like this?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  have to do the Church and the tower, right? So why not split up and do  them both at once?” Serané smiled. “That would be faster, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure about that.” Momomi shrugged. “Besides, every time we try  that, we end up arguing about who goes where and nothing actually gets  done.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you and Kenjou-kun can do the Church, while Rivera-san and Perez-san can do the tower.” Serané smiled. “Sound fair?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds arbitrary,” Kaname quipped, washing her mop in her bucket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, that’s what I say, and I’m the Etoile. You should get to it, okay? Work hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Very well.” Olesa knelt, picking up her bucket. “We’ll take our leave.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, this is hardly fair,” Momomi complained. “They’re only going to slack off in there, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, quit your whining,” Amiki said. “That goes for you two as well, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In the same room as the fear and terror of absolute death over there?” Kaname laughed derisively. “Somehow, I don’t think so…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Kenjou-kun, don’t make me make you suffer.” Serané smiled brilliantly. “That wouldn’t be nice, now would it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, ma’am…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, I’m sure those two can be trusted. They won’t be able to leave until they’ve finished, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Theoretically,  yes. Practically-” Momomi turned, only to find that the two Spanish  girls were already ten meters away. “Never mind. They got away.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  hope you don’t mind too much. I have my reasons, that’s all.” Serané  rested her chin on one hand. “As you know, those two have a lot to  think about.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Leaving the school?” Momomi folded her arms. “I  hope they don’t. That’d be really annoying, after I went to all this  effort civilising them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d be the only kendo regular my age, and all.” Kaname sighed. “That would be pretty inconvenient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  glad you agree, but wouldn’t it be better if you’d told them these  things?” Serané looked thoughtfully at the now-closed door leading to  the tower. “Until you do, they won’t realise what you think of them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We might have told them,” Kaname retorted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, no, but how do you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I know you two.” Serané shrugged. “In any case, they’re strong,  independent girls. They can come to their own decision, about this and  everything else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well… they’re like us.” Momomi smiled  wanly. “They’re slow to understand that what they do will affect their  friends, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané raised her eyebrows. “Oh? Is Kiyashiki-san admitting she has friends?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course. I’m not the person you knew before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané chuckled. “No, I suppose not. You’ve come quite some way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you’re going to stop bothering us now?” Kaname asked hopefully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nope.” Serané waved a finger. “You two aren’t normal just yet. You’re still problem children.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  know, that title’s a badge of honour from you.” Kaname smirked.  “Problem child… it has a nice ring to it. Apart from the child bit.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How are you two doing, anyway? Everything going well?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Sure. Kendo’s good, we’re revising hard, she’s even doing her damn script…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not quite what I meant, but I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s just teasing you,” Momomi said dismissively. “We’re getting on just fine, thanks. We’re going out again on Saturday.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really?  That’s nostalgic. However many times I see it, there’s something very  endearing about young couples like you two.” Serané shrugged. “And  there really is an unexpected number of them…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve popularised it, that’s the problem here,” Kaname commented. “So don’t look at us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, that being as it is, a lot of them end in disaster.” Serané  sighed mournfully. “That’s the less enjoyable side of this job. Kariya  even reckons she’d prefer it if there wasn’t any romance at all…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Honestly,” Momomi sighed. “Everyone’s so encouraging, isn’t it wonderful?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané  laughed. “Don’t be too discouraged. Personally, I think it’s good. Even  if it’s painful, you’ll learn from it, and it can work. We’re more or  less the embodiment of that hope, ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Right, right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of  course, we’ve had our fair share of rows and more than a couple of  major crisis situations.” Serané smirked. “They keep a relationship  fresh, I think. But that’s something for you to look forwards to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Tch.  Who cares about you two? We can manage very well by ourselves, thank  you very much.” Kaname shook her head irritably. “No need to be too  dramatic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well said,” Serané agreed. “I’m sure you two will get on just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Definitely. So don’t worry about us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  make sure you don’t get so caught up in each other you forget your  friends,” Serané began. “I’ve seen that a fair few times, and it’s a  classic error. Especially for you, with your block about socialising…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shizuru!”  Kariya shouted from across the room. “Stop fraternising with the  criminals and get over here! We need your help with staging  arrangements!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Coming, Kariya.” Serané waved cheerfully, walking gracefully across the church. “Good luck, you two.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi watched her go, elegant and beautiful. <em>No matter the surroundings, Serané is something else…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s so whipped,” Kaname muttered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>So much for grace. </em>Momomi snorted. “Considering how bashful you normally are, you can be pretty blunt at times, can’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I just said what you were thinking. Admit it, already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  doesn’t make it normal to say it, you know.” Momomi shrugged. “And  you’re right in a way, but I’ve always wondered whether that’s how it  is, or if it’s the other way round…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who knows?” Kaname shrugged. “Well, I’m not Shion. It’ll keep.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess so.” Momomi sighed thoughtfully. “But what I was actually  thinking… will I ever be as beautiful and graceful as she is, one day?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.” Kaname grounded her mop and folded her arms. “Probably not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi slapped her forehead irritably. “Even if you think that, idiot, you don’t have to say it so firmly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ll  be something quite different, and rather more calculating. But that’s  fine, isn’t it?” Kaname folded her arms. “You’re an individual, and a  smart one, not an idiot aspiring to be exactly like the current Etoile.  When you’re a woman, it’ll be in your terms. And I don’t think you’ll  measure yourself by anything so simple and trivial as beauty and grace.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi actually blushed. “You know, that was almost sweet… how about you? You’ll be the same?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname nodded. “Definitely. Just wait for me, I’ll be a magnificent adult before you know it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I bet you’ll still look like a boy, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, yeah. That suits me just fine. I like being this way, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  you do, you’re awful insecure about it.” Momomi smiled. “But even if I  can intellectually acknowledge that we’ll grow, watching those two,  it’s so hard to remember…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We won’t rush towards it. There’s no need to aspire. That’d just be a waste of effort.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “You’re right, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But,  one day, we’ll be better than those two.” Kaname folded her arms. “I  guarantee it. We don’t even have to worry about it. That’s simply how  it will be.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “You’re hilariously arrogant, aren’t you? Those are the Etoiles, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  what?” Kaname closed her eyes and smirked. “If it’s me and you  together, it’s definitely a feeling I get. Perhaps I’ll be wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ll  see, shall we?” Momomi ran a hand through her hair. “But it would be  nice if that came true someday. For antisocial and unpopular people  like us, that’s just a dream, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Swans come from signets. That’s how the story goes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Signets  aren’t actually that ugly, you know. That’s just an old story.” Momomi  glanced at her. “Besides, should someone so scared of a play say things  like that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname snorted. “Whatever. The important thing is  that you notice they aren’t so special. They aren’t anything we should  worship on bent knees.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “You’re right, again. But aspirations are nice.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname  nodded. “Aspirations are good. But you should aspire to things, not  people. It’s best to be yourself. I wouldn’t be anyone else, not for  anyone’s convenience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed. “That’s too true. So what do I aspire to?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looking at these two? What else?” Kaname grinned. “To be the Etoiles.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi laughed again. “Now you’re just being delusional…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged and smiled. “Perhaps. But it sounds good, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suppose so. That’s good enough, isn’t it?” Momomi offered her hand.  “How about it? I’ll chase that dream if you’ll chase it with me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why  not? I can’t back down, if I raised it in the first place.” Kaname took  her hand, and they smiled at each other, eyes glittering with amusement  and affection. “Together, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi nodded. “Together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kariya waved irritably. “Hey! You two! Lovey-dovey moments won’t clean the floor, you know!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serané smiled affectionately. “You’re ruining the ambience, Kariya… can’t you be a little more considerate?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s just damn inappropriate, in the middle of a Church.”</span></p>
