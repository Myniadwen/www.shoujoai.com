<p>“So, your story,” Kaname said.</p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My  story,” Momomi said. “Well, you got to use a pseudonym, indicating your  insecurity of choice. Call it the story of a girl who was always  everything people expected her to be and was never allowed to be  herself. A girl trapped in the expectations of others. Made by the  expectations of others. A mirror girl, pretty much. Glass and silver  backing, and a world of illusion behind that. Just a trick of light,  with all the soul of such a thing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My, my,” Kaname said, looking up at the sky. “That’s an entire month’s worth of self-pity, contracted into a few sentences.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You were no different,” Momomi said. “Remember?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Granted,” Kaname admitted. “More fool you for listening, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, if you don’t want to hear, I won’t say it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kaname shrugged. “I want to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Alright.  But it really begins with my or her parents, I suppose. Her father’s an  aristocrat of the old school in Italy. A dying breed. Kept afloat by  rent on land and smart investments, and fabulously rich as a result of  a greedy person taking everything they could as soon as they could,  long ago. They still have servants, they’re that rich. And they’re  good, impeccable Catholics, and casual racists. So it was pretty  unfortunate when my father married a Japanese woman.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How did that happen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“He  want to Japan to oversee something or other. I forget. He was only  second in line, with a married, perfect older brother. I remember my  grandparents. They weren’t afraid of saying that my uncle had deserved  to take all, and that my father was a failure, and my mother… well, it  can’t be put politely, so forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re rambling a bit,” Kaname said. “I say that by way of making conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“More digressions, more information for you?” Momomi asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Something like that. I’m enamoured of understanding what makes you, because you’re very weird.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  just wish I knew where that eloquence goes when you’re talking to  others,” Momomi said. “You only manage stuff along the lines of the  final clause. But never mind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She raised her hand to eye level  and inspected it thoughtfully. “In any case. Father, like all our  family, had a lot of language education. More than enough to get by. So  he chinwagged with some of the aristocrats here. I think some of their  daughters go to this school, actually. The old Japanese families. All  about business and diplomacy and the price of a decent horse nowadays.  That reminds me. Amane’s family, too. The Otori are famous.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not always in a good way,” Kaname noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  darling Amane’s on the wrong family line,” Momomi said. “She won’t be  poor, by any stretch of the imagination, but she’s inheriting a living,  not an empire. I think she’s consciously chosen to be out of the muck,  by her or her parents. Otherwise, she’d be at that other posh private  school. The mixed one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For once, this isn’t about Amane,” Kaname said. “You don’t have to bring everything back to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  don’t have to be eternally annoyed with me mentioning her,” Momomi  said. “She’s a good point of reference. But I’m on a tangent again,  I’ll admit. At some point, father met mother. A very beautiful, very  weak woman who can’t do anything but be ornamental and useless and rely  on father and defer to his every decision. I can only hope that he saw  something other than the obvious in her, but as far as I can see she  lacked, and lacks ambition, talent, drive or intelligence. I hate  people like her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That seems pointless,” Kaname said. “I’d congratulate her on using so well what she did have, in such a circumstance.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  how father walked over her afterwards that irks me,” Momomi said. “But  that’s an aside. Mother wasn’t what I’d call poor- you’d call her rich-  but she wasn’t what you’d call one of the elite. She did do well, apart  from everything else that ever happened to her, ever. But their  marriage was her one moment of triumph.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So the child of a moderately racist aristocratic family married a woman below him? Can we recap that?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  shrugged. “Well, he wanted to do that. His parents decided that as he  was the second son they didn’t care enough to stop him. From anyone but  my parents, it would almost be romantic. A tale of forbidden love and  rebellious children. As it is, he’s the most unfaithful bastard you’ve  ever met and he hates her. She doesn’t hate him, but only because she  lacks the strength of character.” Momomi sighed. “It’s a pretty  depressing lineage, really. I hate my mother, but my father more.  Whatever she had, he killed it in her. I’m stronger than she is, so I’m  never going to let anyone do that to me. Love and romance and fairy  stories sound great, but life’s a lot less pleasant and messier. It’s a  show of human optimism, or folly, that they’re still so idealised.” She  sighed. “But I guess I’m not telling you anything.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s for sure,” Kaname said. “Be glad your mother isn’t a whiny Catholic.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your  mother sounds strong, in a stupid kind of way,” Momomi said. “I’d  prefer her. I’m sure she’d hate my father beautifully. But love’s  pretty ridiculous. We can accept that someone can love someone else,  but not that they could love two people. And the idea that love is any  weaker if someone’s married and they’ve fallen for someone else is  stupid. It might even be stronger than the love before. I’m not  defending my father, though. He’s just weak, and I suspect he’s not so  fussed as to demand he’s in love with them all. That kind of action  shows no determination on any long-term scale. But falling in love  before marriage is the same damn thing. That romantic love is no guide  at all as to whether anything can work long-term, but in the estimation  of many it’s the only way marriage should be conducted. Arranged  marriage makes just as much sense. That’s to say, none at all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  amused that you, the aristocrat who resents the fact she’s destined for  it, constructs a defence of arranged marriage,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  arranged marriage is stupid,” Momomi said. “And I hate it. But only  because it takes the choice away from the person, someone like me. That  doesn’t mean the person is any better at making a decision. But at  least that way they know it’s their own damn fault when it all goes  wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about you? Can you decide better?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I told  you,” Momomi said. “I’m not going to let anyone do to me what they did  to mother. On the other hand, I’m not going to let my life be defined  by father. So I guess I’ll just act on whatever whim pleases me, like  everyone else. It can’t be helped. Whatever I choose, I doubt it’ll  please my parents. That’ll be the closest thing to confirmation that  I’ve made a good choice I’ll ever have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“For all those books you read, you’ve got a dark attitude on all this,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you any different?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not really,” Kaname admitted. “I don’t think I really care. It’s never been relevant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve  been a kid,” Momomi said. “A tough one with more claim to independence  than almost anyone else. But a kid. But the way people work, I’m sure  someone will see that you’re pretty and miss that awkward personality  of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What kind of person do you see me with, then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess, the helpless type, who likes abusive girls for as long as they  protect them,” Momomi said. “You’re the kind that likes to thing you’re  strong enough to protect more than just yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d only protect someone worth protecting,” Kaname said. “I’m more likely to hate someone like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How  about me?” Momomi asked. “You try and invent someone I could stand for  more than five minutes. Or who can stand me for that duration.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  the latter case, much the same person, I suppose,” Kaname admitted  “Perhaps someone who preferred being patronised in words than in deeds.  As for someone you could stand… I’m sure even the finest specimen of  humanity couldn’t satisfy your demands.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I couldn’t stand a perfect person, yes,” Momomi said. “But some kinds of imperfection can be interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not sure how long that could last,” Kaname said. “But you expect that.  You’re so dreary about this, dear Momomi, I’m sure I’ll be forced to  read some of your nauseating novels.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You agree with me. I just put it into words first.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps,”  Kaname said. “I’d still love to proved wrong. If you agree with me,  though, then I’m more afraid that I might be right.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,”  Momomi said. “I guess we can both dream, and then see. More thoughtful  than you normally are, though. I thought you’d damn love.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  only ever read and heard about love, of any kind,” Kaname said. “So I’m  just curious. Cynicism requires actual experience of the topic in hand,  on some level. But my parents sure as hell are no example at all.  That’s pretty irrelevant, though. You haven’t weaselled out of you  finishing your story.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sorry,” Momomi said. “I feel our random  speculations are more interesting, though. My life story’s fairly  boring. Compared to yours, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say that too much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  still true. I admire you for what you come from, to where you are, and  I hope that’s not patronising. The end product I admire somewhat less,  of course…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t let you patronise me, after all,” Kaname  said. “But I don’t think my story’s inspiring. Only if the works of  those random Russian authors are inspiring.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In any case, we  learned a lot of languages,” Momomi said. “I think I can hold my own  conversing in French, German, English and Chinese, since we were taught  that often at the exclusion of other subjects. Our tutors also worked  us harder than we would be in normal education. But our mother taught  us Japanese as a second mother tongue, and we speak it as well as we do  Italian. My sister and me. We never spoke it, though, until I came  here. Now it feels more like my language than any other does. But only  because my presence here is the first time I’ve felt freedom. So I use  my mother’s name and speak her language, even though I hate her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re  still skipping a lot,” Kaname said. “We managed to get from some time  after your unspoken birth to your sudden and singular presence here,  while your sister remained behind.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Most of that time, you can  guess,” Momomi said. “I was raised to be an aristocrat, eventually to  marry. As second daughter to the head of the family, that’s it. My  uncle died before I was born. Some kind of heart disease. It was pretty  sudden. So the grandparents were left with two choices; make his widow  the heir or else entitle my father, and his Japanese wife, instead. I  suspect that was a very hard choice for them, and that they berated  themselves for letting my father marry my mother. Regardless. They kept  it in the bloodline. I should have said that sooner, but I’ve said it  now. We’re now set to inherit from our parents, or more precisely my  sister. Actually, my nephew is older than use and quite liked by our  parents. But that’s my sister’s worry, not mine. The inheritance won’t  go to me, and I don’t want it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d guess that your sister would  be rather kinder in providing for you, though,” Kaname said. “It sounds  like you have something of a rapport, in the interests of survival if  nothing else.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d rather not rely on that, though,” Momomi  said. “You may not believe it, but I don’t want to be a privileged,  useless aristocrat forever. I don’t want to end up like mother. So I’ll  have to stand alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Have you any idea how?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m thirteen. Cut me some slack.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. And I thought you were the long term planner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have any suggestions?” Momomi asked hotly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not  really,” Kaname said. “Come back to me in two years. And I’ve no ideas  what I want to do with my life, either. I’d join the army, probably,  but they patronise women. I’d never be treated like a man. Pisses me  off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You want to be treated like a man?” Momomi asked wryly. “You’re such a feminist.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not a coherent ideological position,” Kaname said. “I’ll just break the  face of anyone who says I can’t do something because I’m female.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I can tell you that because you’re a woman the army will never let you  be a frontline soldier,” Momomi said. “Besides, I think you’d be wasted  on the army. I don’t know… I can’t see you easily fit into any career.  But you’re too orientated on the physical. Sure, you’re strong. But  you’re smart, real smart, do something with that instead. It pays more.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I come alive when I’m using my strength, not my mind,” Kaname said. “The latter’s just a means to an end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll change that. There’s so much more you can do with your mind. You’d enjoy it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Off-topic,” Kaname murmured. “You’ve got a knack, I’ll grant you that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t mean to. But whenever I talk to you, I always come up with  something more interesting than the actual point in hand,” Momomi said.  “Beats awkward silences, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re silent all the time,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  it’s not awkward. I can’t think of some stupid excuse for that, it just  is. But whatever.” Momomi sighed. “In any case, where were we? Well, I  flatter myself that I can almost pass for a Japanese native. Not quite,  but close, and I’m getting better. That was all mother had to give us.  She’s hopeless. Even so, father didn’t really approve, and he still  doesn’t. But he was away so much he couldn’t stop it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve  noticed that,” Kaname said. “Well, that you’re very Japanese. You  pretty much had me fooled, though I’m not very observant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  people can be as different as you and Amane, from the same country, I’m  sure I pass,” Momomi said. “I’ve mentioned my loathing of my life  before, though. Father is not a pleasant man. Mother’s not perfect. She  used to snap at us, because she couldn’t snap at him. One day, when she  attacked me, my sister stood up and… well, it’s kinda embarrassing. My  father thrashed her. But mother never snapped at us again. Depressing.  The point is that we had to be exactly what people expected us to be,  to survive. When the mask cracked, we got hurt. My sister was always  more herself. I relied on her, and my own ability to conceal my true  self. At the same time, though, my sister liked her life, and continues  to enjoy it. I hated everything, from the dancing to the manners to the  pleasantries to the conventions and rules. I supposed you’d call her  the stronger one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds to me like they just did a better job  on her,” Kaname said. “I’m not sure whether you’re seeking assurance or  not, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t know,” Momomi said. “I should know better than seeking sympathy from you. But the point is that I hated that life.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  pulled free a tuft of grass, and shredded it silently. “So, you also  have to imagine my world. For twelve years, I’d lived in our house,  pretty much. Occasionally we’d go on a trip, or on holiday. More when I  was younger, less as I grew older. But my teaching was done in the  house, with tutors, and I never saw much of the outside world. Oh, we  had those balls and everything else. But that doesn’t make me anything  more than a sheltered upper class aristocrat. That’s pretty much what I  was. Am. I go to this school.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So do I,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Point  taken. But I was sheltered, trapped, caged, and knew it. So perhaps one  can characterise my actions as the desire to be free.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And your actions were?” Kaname asked patiently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nothing  too exiting,” Momomi said. “I have to say that over and over again. But  you’ll just tell me to carry on, and I will. In any case, I took an  increasing interest in the outside world. That would be a year ago,  maybe. It’s not that we didn’t get to go outside. But I suppose I had a  morbid interest in the bits that we never got to see, probably because  it was forbidden. I made all the excuses I could and manipulated and  smiled and did all the stuff I do best, and got to see something of  that world. Your world, maybe. It seemed very bizarre and quite  frightening to me, but I was really quite morbid. You’d call me  patronising, but I was mostly just impressed. It’s pretty terrible to  say, but seeing people living in poverty, whenever I could find them,  only increased my understanding of father and how he acted. Of course,  they weren’t exactly friendly to me either. Who would be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re honest, anyway,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When did you realise that people could be as rich as me, anyway?” Momomi asked. “Just out of curiosity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“When  I came to this school,” Kaname said briefly. “But I wasn’t too  surprised. You all act in a very disgusting way, but that’s okay. I  don’t mind inequality. I have and intend to continue to become the very  best. Not an aristocrat. But look at this way. I’ve risen above my  birth. If I was born rich, I wouldn’t be able to do that.” She closed  her eyes. “I believe in having a superiority complex.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  you’re very true to your beliefs,” Momomi said. “And I’m much the same.  But, really, neither of us have very much to be proud of. When my  father found out, he forbade it, because I enjoyed it. But it wasn’t  very safe, anyway. Again, these two facts only encouraged me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m amazed you survived.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me  too, actually. Especially when I took to sneaking off in the middle of  the night,” Momomi said. “I got caught a lot. Suffice to say I wasn’t  best pleased with my parents, and they me, at that time, for that  reason and for others. More adultery, argument and the rest of the  house’s tedious routine. So wandering outside when I shouldn’t be was  both a rebellion and a relief. I had a couple of close escapes, but  that didn’t stop me. Call it a deathwish. And then, there was that one  time which was very nearly an actual death…” Momomi’s eyes went distant.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Which was?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There  was a guy called Garen,” Momomi said vaguely. “He wasn’t very nice, but  seemed nice. At first he saved me, and I was very grateful. We talked,  and agreed to meet up again. I saw him a few times. Told him some  stuff. Then he… well, pretty much tried to kidnap me. Only I’d followed  the advice <em>he’d </em>given me, and brought a dagger from back home.  It was sharp. I’ll tell you something, Kaname. Anyone is in real pain,  whoever stabs them, if they’re stabbed while their guard is down.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that,” Kaname said. “But slow down. Who was this guy? What did he  save you from? How old was he? What was he like? Why did you trust him?  What exactly happened?” She sighed. “The rest of your narrative is  rambling, but detailed. You seem to have skipped that here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like to talk about it,” Momomi said. “That’s enough, isn’t it? What do you want to know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m also amused you call that a dull story,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I doubt it was news to you, that kind of thing,” Momomi said. “Besides,  it was really a stupid bratty kid being stupid. Not that exiting. The  police dealt with the rest, and I had a pretty hellish few days. Mother  was in tears pretty well continuously. Sis was initially critical, but  quickly came round on my side when she realised how much everyone else  was being critical. Father was… oh, do I even have to say the words? I  hate him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So you got sent here,” Kaname said. “In brief. As a punishment, or to protect you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Punishment,”  Momomi said. “I mean, if I really wanted to get myself killed all I  have to do is pick a direction and walk, around here. Town’s not too  far away, albeit smaller than Venice, but probably still with its poor  areas. If they really just wanted to protect me, locking me up at home  would work a lot better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That figures.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But there was  some politics to it, too, so to speak,” Momomi said. “You’ll have  gathered that me and Sis were always covering for each other. We were  both good liars, smart and strong. Well, we still are. I think father  wanted to be rid of that, for now. Said I was a bad influence on my  sister, which isn’t really true. I never really influenced her, as  such, she was too strong for that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You like your sister, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  don’t like how she uses her energy,” Momomi said. “She’s like a less  naïve Serané. It’s all about the title she’ll hold one day. But less  family love. Even so, yes, I admire her. I guess it’s natural for the  first child to act like she does, and the second to act as I do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re lucky,” Kaname said. “I never had anyone to admire. Anyone from my family I in any way liked.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  I’ve been separated from her,” Momomi said. “At first, that was hard.  But now I’m used to it. My mother begged and cried and… ugh… well, she  made father send me here. That’s the only thing she’s ever done for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d like to meet your mother,” Kaname said. “It sounds to me like you’re unfair to her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh,  you say that, and I sound that,” Momomi said. “But she’s so annoying.  You’d never stand her, not for five minutes. You don’t exactly tolerate  weakness yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll grant that,” Kaname said. “But when I  hear about you…” she folded her hands behind her head, closing her  eyes, “I realise everything I missed out on. It sounds pretty  dysfunctional and messed up, but you have a real family. All I have is  a mother who wishes I was dead. At the same time, you’re not lucky.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Garen  was the hardest thing,” Momomi said. “I’m not really going into that.  But you understand now. There’s a reason why I’m so alone here. It was  my choice. I could have lied my way into the social hierarchy, I have  that potential. But, for a start, I’ve always known that I would have  to leave, sooner than I’d like. And after that… well, I wasn’t very  inclined to count on anyone. I’m still not.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Welcome to my world,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  I trust you,” Momomi said shyly. Kaname blinked. “That’s the weird  thing. It makes me feel pretty stupid. So much for my resolutions, so  much for me learning my lesson, and especially when you’re so- like-  him, relative to everyone else here… it’s hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is that so?”  Kaname said. “You really shouldn’t trust me, of all people. But I  suppose I’m in some small way glad. Or something. Whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi  placed a hand on her shoulder without meeting her eyes. “Right. I’m  glad you’re glad, because it’s getting important for me, especially  now… whatever happens. I want you to stay with me while you can. While  I can, really.” She felt a shock run through Kaname, and closed her  eyes. “I know I’m sounding stupid. I feel stupid. So forget it…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shouldn’t be a problem,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi glanced at her, and saw that she was still looking at the sky. “Are you blushing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“At least I’m still linguistically coherent,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re <em>never </em>linguistically coherent,” Momomi said. “But as long as its only us making fools out of each other, that sounds okay to me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And here I was thinking that you’d invented our awkward silences,” Kaname said. “But you’ve found way to fill it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Momomi sighed. “Yep.” She hugged Kaname lightly. “How about now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Did that when I told my story,” Kaname said. “I should be hugging you, but that’s not my style. Lying down makes it hard.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You probably prefer it when you can remind me that you’re taller than me,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Precisely,” Kaname said. “Is that a bad thing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Probably just a thing,” Momomi said. “Even so, it’s very you. You identify in very masculine ways.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  identify in manners associated with power,” Kaname said. “It’s not my  fault that the behaviour of dominance is classically associated with  men.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wouldn’t call you dominant, though,” Momomi said. “If  that was the case, you’d be the one saying the awkwardly embarrassing  things. If you want to do that, be my guest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>This is how our worlds shift.</em> Momomi smiled slightly in the momentary lull, glancing at Kaname’s composed face. <em>Those  strong aquiline features, framed with her mannish blue hair… she’s such  a tomboy. So much so she’s almost a caricature of it, but it’s still  cute. But this is our way of doing things. And it could be worse.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  any case, that’s satisfied my curiosity for now,” Kaname said  eventually. “We can’t afford to loaf around. We need to discuss our  next move.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Right,” Momomi said. “Well, as I said, we need to  get the Etoiles on our side, if at all possible. I’m not sure how to do  that, though.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It pains me to admit it,” Kaname said. “But if we  have a choice, we should approach Kariya-sama first. She’s a more  natural rebel. I doubt I’ll do too much with her, but you’re the kind  of twit who can provoke a reaction from her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Like Serané, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s far more graceful,” Kaname said. “And also rather older.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, quite. But they’re together a lot of the time, anyway,” Momomi said. “So I’ll just play it by the ear.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.  The Sisters aren’t likely to be any help at all. But I suppose we could  try with some other people, too, the student council for Spica and so  on. But I wouldn’t be too hopeful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know, though, I was thinking…” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The Etoiles really have a powerful position, don’t they?” Momomi said. “Even Serané was talking back to the Superior.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  not really the position,” Kaname said. “It’s more the power they gain  from the students. A cult of personality. You’re all very suggestible,  you aristocrats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I guess it’s a romantic dream, really,” Momomi  said. “They embody a story, a fantasy tale, and because we don’t have  much freedom outside the world of Astraea Hill, we like to sit and  watch that fantasy. The Etoiles embody our own wish fantasy, and so we  love them.” She shrugged. “Or maybe I’m just overanalysing. Certainly,  our class should generate the most charismatic of individuals, and  Serané and Kariya are both that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Whatever,” Kaname said. “It’s  never concerned me, except when Kariya takes an over-lively interest in  me. I’ll admit it, Serané’s a dreamer, but you don’t want to mess with  her knight.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,” Momomi said. “I’d like to know how it’s done, though. That’s what I call power. If only they thought to use it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not inclined to poetry, but maybe they have it because they won’t use it,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  that’s easy. You just pretend that you won’t use it, either,” Momomi  said. “It’s interesting, though… hmm. I’ve had a thought. Remember that  creepy stalker girl? And not you, either. The other one. The third  year. Shion, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That’s right,” Kaname said. “She’s an odd one. What about her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think I might go to her for help,” Momomi said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What help’s she? She’s a nobody!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There’s  several reasons,” Momomi said. “First, she knows this school a lot  better than us, as she’s been here longer and takes more interest.  Second, she’s somewhere between the Etoiles and us on the front of  manipulative scheming, so I think she’ll go with us easier. Thirdly, we  have some easy leverage over her. She wants us to help her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You don’t suggest we go through with her games?” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  suggest exactly that,” Momomi said sweetly. “I can’t be picky. And in  any case… if I really can stay here indefinitely, if I win, half the  reason for this perpetual isolation will be gone. I don’t see the harm  in getting just a little involved.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t like it,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,  Amane can just attract attention without trying,” Momomi said slyly.  “We’re not so lucky. A little work couldn’t harm us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t mock me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perish  the thought,” Momomi said. “But really, genuinely… this is all getting  kind of tiring. I can understand for as long as I wasn’t sure how long  I would be here. But you, and me too, perhaps, if we’re here for  duration-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or until we fail the scholarship exams,” Kaname said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Or  until we fail the scholarship exams,” Momomi conceded, “I don’t think  I’d be patient with the way we live now. People either look down on us  or don’t think of us, and they’re far less bright than we are.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’ve changed,” Kaname said. “Before, you’d be fine with that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re probably right,” Momomi said. “Well, fine, I don’t have any plans yet. I guess I’ll concentrate on one thing at a time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s alright for you, though, to say you can be popular,” Kaname said. “That’s not my area.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I know,” Momomi said. “Just listen to me, if it comes to that. You’ll get the hang of it soon enough. But one thing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She grabbed Kaname’s hand. “I want you to promise me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Promise you what?” Kaname asked slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That you won’t get into any more fights,” Momomi said. “If you do that, then <em>I’m </em>the one who’ll be screwed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ha. Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Plus, you do have to look after yourself more.”</span></p>
