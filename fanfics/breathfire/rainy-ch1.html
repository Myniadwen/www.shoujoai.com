<h1>A Rainy Night</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../breathfire/index.html">Breath of Fire</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nobaka.html">NoBaka</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The rain pounded at the windows. It was one of those days. Katt put 
down the nail-file and pulled her feet of the desk in Nina&#146;s room. 
Nina was reading a book on her bed, feet up in the air. Katt looked 
around the room, at the mess they&#146;d made, and let out a sigh of 
frustration, then put her feet back up.

They&#146;d played every board game in the house, dusted everything they 
could lay their hands on, snoozed, even played some bizarre video game 
Bow had salvaged from the great Machine. Something called Breath of 
Fire II: The Destined Child; playing it gave Katt the creeps. There 
was a cat-girl like her in it, but she was a total dunce. Anyway, they 
were back in Nina&#146;s room, just chilling, waiting for the rain to stop.

Ryu and Ray were out of town, and the rest of the guys were stuck at 
the bar next door, the rain was so heavy. Deis had vanished somewhere, 
no one knew, no one cared. It was just a lazy, slow, boring day.

&quot;Auggh! I&#146;m so bored!&quot; Katt finally exclaimed, standing up and 
stretching. Nina barely even glanced away from her book at her 
friend&#146;s outburst. &quot;Isn&#146;t there anything we can do?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m open to suggestions.&quot; Nina said, uninterestedly.

&quot;I got none.&quot; Katt grumbled, crossing her arms and leaning back 
against the chair. After a moment of thought, she came up with 
something. &quot;You know Ryu loves both of us, right?&quot;

Nina put down her book. &quot;Yeah. I don&#146;t think he wants either of us to 
feel unwanted or unloved.&quot;

&quot;And we want him to be happy, right?&quot; Katt said. She thought for a 
moment, and then chuckled slightly. &quot;Naw, you ain&#146;t like that. . .&quot;

&quot;Did you say something?&quot; Nina asked. &quot;What&#146;re you laughing about?&quot;

Nina&#146;s voice seemed to break Katt out of a memory reverie. &quot;Hmm? What? 
Oh, nothing. Just remembering someone from a while ago.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Nina shifted foreward on the bed. &quot;Come on. Tell me. You&#146;ve 
told me everything else. . .&quot;

&quot;Oh, just a fellow nightclub dancer.&quot; Katt reminsced. She smiled. &quot;I 
met her when I was just a rookie in the nightclub scene. She helped me 
get through the first shaky months. And she taught me things. . .&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot;

&quot;Well, you have to see this from my point of view.&quot; Katt explained. &quot;I 
was scared, at first, and I couldn&#146;t stand having the men leer at me. 
But at the same time, I needed someone to love me. That&#146;s where my 
friend came in. . .&quot;

Nina was aghast. &quot;You were a lesbian?!&quot;

The Woren girl made calming motions with her hands. &quot;Easy, easy. . . 
I&#146;m not a lez. I love Ryu, and that&#146;s proof enough. I just. . . 
dabbled. Anyway, she was my lover for a long time before she left for 
Windia, and never returned. I never knew what happened to her. But 
then I met Ryu, so all turned out well.&quot;

&quot;What made you think of this girl?&quot; Nina asked, intrigued.

&quot;Well, for one thing, the rain. We used to kill time on rainy days by, 
er, having fun. Another is you.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Katt nodded, mouth a tight line. &quot;You&#146;re about the same height 
and body type as her, but only your hair is different. And you&#146;re a 
Windian. She was human.&quot;

&quot;Creepy.&quot;

Katt shrugged. &quot;I guess. I just kinda miss her right now.&quot;

There was an awkward pause as both girls searched for something else 
to talk about. Finally, Nina said the only thing on her mind.

&quot;So, what&#146;s it like?&quot; She asked. &quot;I mean, with another woman? I&#146;ve 
never even thought about that sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#146;s like. . .&quot; Katt paused, at a loss for words. &quot;I mean. . . 
It&#146;s sorta. . . Crap. I can&#146;t explain it. I mean, it&#146;s sex, but it&#146;s . 
. . better.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#146;t tell me much.&quot; Nina pointed out, drawing her knees up 
and wrapping her arms around them. &quot;Isn&#146;t there anyway you can tell me 
what it&#146;s like?&quot;

&quot;Not really. I guess the only way for you to know is. . .&quot; She turned 
bright red with embarassment. &quot;If I showed you.&quot;

&quot;If you showed me?&quot; Nina&#146;s fine eyebrow went up. &quot;You mean. . .&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. You aren&#146;t into that kinda stuff.&quot; Katt turned away. 
&quot;Just. . . Forget I said anything.&quot;

&quot;Katt. . .&quot; Nina got up and walked up behind her. She placed one hand 
on Katt&#146;s shoulder. &quot;I want to know. I want to try this.&quot;

The shorter Woren girl turned, her eyes probing Nina&#146;s for some sign 
of falsehood. &quot;You want to?&quot; She asked unsurely.

Nina nodded and gave a sheepish smile. &quot;I might never experience it 
otherwise.&quot;
Katt inclined her head slightly, and let her eyes roam the room. 
&quot;Well. . . If we really are going to do this, I suppose we should get 
comfortable.&quot;

&quot;The bed?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, let&#146;s go there.&quot;

***

So, there they were, sitting on the bed, glancing from each other to 
the floor and back. It was very awkward. Both girls were sort of 
embarassed, or nervous, but everyone was like that their first time, 
right?

Katt coughed, to break the tension. Didn&#146;t work. Another few minutes 
of uncomfortable silence; Katt&#146;s tail swung back and forth anxiously 
on the bedspread, and Nina absently ran a hand through her hair, 
brushing an errant lock of gold away.

Finally, Nina had to ask. &quot;So. . . what do we do first?&quot;

&quot;Well, the old saying says &#145;It all starts with a kiss&#146;. . .&quot; Katt 
replied. She gave Nina a strange, seductive look, and then leaned in 
and kissed her.

It wasn&#146;t a light peck, or even a short kiss. It was a delicate, soft 
kiss. The kind that slowly evolved from being close mouthed to open 
mouthed, from being chaste to uninhibited. As they kissed, Katt 
reached up to touch Nina&#146;s cheek, and Nina responded by clasping her 
arm at the wrist.

They interlinked the fingers of their raised hands, and lay down 
beside each other on the bed, not separating as they descended. Katt 
moved her hand from Nina&#39;s cheek to around her waist, and Nina moved 
her hand up Katt&#39;s arm to near her shoulder.

Finally, they stopped kissing, and Katt smiled. Nina smiled as well, 
and, disengaging her hand from their hold, reached over and brushed a 
forelock from Katt&#39;s face, letting her hand trail through her hair and 
tracing a line around the rim of her fur-covered ear. The Woren girl 
responded by turning into Nina&#39;s hand and letting the soft skin of her 
hand caress Katt&#39;s cheek and face. She let out a &quot;mmm. . .&quot; of 
pleasure as Nina touched her face with lightest of touches.

They lay there staying into each other&#39;s eyes, not saying anything. 
Katt curled her tail around to slide it up and down Nina&#39;s bare leg. 
Seeing the Windian&#39;s obvious shiver of pleasure work its way up her 
back, Katt switched her tail&#39;s tip for her hand, trailing her fingers 
and the palm of her hand lightly along the same range of movement. But 
where she let her tail only move along Nina&#39;s leg and hip, she allowed 
her hand to travel even further up Nina&#39;s body, above the hem of her 
dress to her side, and then stroking down her front, across the taller 
girl&#39;s smooth belly.

Nina looked down Katt&#39;s body. &quot;That belt. . . Isn&#39;t it uncomfortable?&quot;

Katt&#39;s hand paused in its gentle sweeping as she thought about it. 
&quot;Well, it&#39;s mainly for show. It does get itchy though. . .&quot;

The blonde girl smiled and reached over, giving the top of it a tug 
with her finger. &quot;Doesn&#39;t look easy to wear.&quot;

She reached around and unlatched the make-shift buckle on the side. 
The original buckle had been destroyed by Ryu in the Coursair Arena, 
so Katt had to make do with a simple string knot that tended to come 
apart quite easily. As was the case.

With no effort, Nina undid the knot with one hand, and then tossed it 
aside. Katt&#39;s midriff was now bare, revealling pale skin and the 
very-rarely-seen bellybutton. With a single brush of her cool hand, 
Nina gave Katt goosebumps.

&quot;. . . Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot; Katt pointed out, and Nina nodded. She 
rolled over so Katt could reach the buttons that ran down the back of 
her blue dress. Katt carefully undid each button, and when she was 
done, just to see Nina&#39;s reaction, she brushed her fingers down her 
spine, from back of the neck down to the edge of her exposed rear. The 
effect was instantaneous as Nina gasped and arced her back, wings 
fluttering a bit.

&quot;You&#39;re ticklish, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She asked playfully, unclasping Nina&#39;s 
brasierre, the silk undergarment dropping away. &quot;That&#39;ll make things 
more interesting. . .&quot;

Nina laid back down, bare-topped but still wearing her panties, and 
looked Katt in the eye, arms crossed to cover herself. &quot;What about 
you? Are you ticklish?&quot;

&quot;Me? Well I. . .&quot; Katt tried to think up something. Nina just smiled 
and laid back down next to her. She ran her hand up from Katt&#39;s hip to 
almost under her arm, and then, seeming to want to slide her hand back 
to caress her breast, but instead slide it around her back. She had to 
shift foreward, closer, to get her arm totally around Katt, bringing 
them so close together that she could feel Katt&#39;s warm, quickened 
breath on her bare chest and neck.

This close to her, Katt could see a rosy blush to Nina&#39;s cheeks, as 
well as the rapid beating of her own heart. They were only scant 
hairbreadths apart; if either of them shifted, they would end up 
brushing bare skin in many places.

Nina&#39;s hand slowly travelled around Katt&#39;s side and back, and along 
the way, found the clasp that held the lower part of her tunic 
together, the top half being held by her collar. Once it was undone, 
she lightly pulled it towards her, and away from Katt, and then let it 
drop, still attached to Katt&#39;s collar.

&quot;Take off your collar.&quot; Nina told her. Katt reached back to undo the 
collar. Then she paused. In the process of her reaching back, the last 
portion of cloth fell away from her athletic bosom. She stared at Nina 
for a second, hands at the latch on her collar, and then pulled her 
hands away, leaving it still on.

&quot;You do it.&quot;

Nina&#39;s breath caught a bit, as she realized that to do so, she would 
end up in complete bodily contact with the young Woren. After a 
moment, and a slight hesitation, she said &quot;Alright.&quot; and carefully 
reached around Katt&#39;s neck with both hands, to undo the single latch 
that would render Katt naked.

As Nina&#39;s hands went around her neck, Katt immediately saw an 
opportunity, and slid right into Nina&#39;s arms, bringing the two of them 
into such close quarters that they were face to face. She also slid 
one softly furred leg between Nina&#39;s to twine with them, and allow her 
to bring waist into contact with the Windian&#39;s hip.

Nina froze when she felt Katt&#39;s body against her, but after a moment, 
and a glance at Katt, continued in trying to undo the latch. The link 
was proving to be exceedingly difficult to unhook. . . And her mind 
was constantly drifting back to Katt, and the leg with which she was 
using to caress Nina&#39;s bare leg.

Katt could see how Nina&#39;s cheeks flushed when she moved in like that, 
and smiled a bit more. Her right hand slid down and around Nina&#39;s 
side, to the waistband of her panties, and she slipped a finger under 
the edge, and then a few more. As she began to slide the soft panties 
off the taller girl, she also ran her hand over the gentle curve of 
her rear, and then down the back of the milky thigh, pulling the 
panties with it.

But that just slid the back of the feminine undergarment off. Katt 
deftly slid her hand around the alabaster thigh and onto the front of 
Nina&#39;s panties, where she gently
caressed her through the silk.

The gasp Nina let out, and the almost spasmatic twitch she did 
coincided with the moment the latch on Katt&#39;s collar came undone. When 
she had gotten over her initial shock of Katt&#39;s gentle caress, she 
took the collar and tossed it behind her, onto the floor beyond the 
bed. With the collar went Katt&#39;s tunic-top.

Katt was slowly caressing the silk front of the panties, not making 
any movement to remove them, and was watching Nina&#39;s expression go 
from a kind of shock, to building arousal, to near ecstasy. She gave a 
kind of teasing look as she whispered, &quot;This silk is quite. . . soft. 
. .&quot;

The Windian girl regained a little bit of her composure. &quot;Uhh. . . 
yes, it is. . .&quot;

She reached down with both hands, touching and guiding the smaller 
girl&#39;s hand in its movements, her breath quickening with each stroke. 
On one particular stroke, her hand brushed against Katt, and she 
immediately felt the Woren&#39;s warmth and dampness through the girl&#39;s 
soft fur. She smiled a bit, but went back to what she had been doing; 
taking Katt&#39;s hand, she used the girl&#39;s fingers to slid the panties 
farther down, almost to her knees, before bringing them back up.

Nina gasped softly a few times, as Katt&#39;s thin fingers found very 
sensitive spots on the way up, spots that had been covered by the silk 
until a moment ago. She stopped moving Katt&#39;s hand, and held it in 
place. Katt picked up on the sign, and gently slid a finger in, a soft 
probe.

The more Katt probed, the more ragged Nina&#39;s breathing became, until 
she found the spot she was looking for. Nina&#39;s response was 
instantaneous; Her back arched, and her wings fluttered, and she 
opened her mouth as if to gasp in surprise, but nothing came. Thoughts 
whirled through her mind, disjointed and disconnected, as wave upon 
wave of ecstasy passed over her: [I-incredible!. . . Oh my!. . .How 
does she know that . . . spot?. . .]

That&#39;s when she realized there was a warm spot on her hip; With her 
sudden arching, she had inadvertently shifted foreward, bringing 
herself into full contact with Katt. Even at the heights of pleasure 
as she was now, she could see how flushed Katt&#39;s face had become, and 
how anxious she was. In fact, the younger girl was biting her lip, 
trying to control herself. Seeing Nina like this, and in this way, 
must have turned her on quite a bit, because Nina could practically 
feel the heat rising of her little body. [Her need must be so great 
right now that it&#39;s practically painful!] Nina thought to herself.

And indeed, Katt&#39;s face was quite flushed. She was breathing heavily, 
even though nothing had been done to pleasure her. Nina couldn&#39;t 
exactly say anything even if she had anything to say; being in the 
position she was in, the only sounds she could manage were gasps and 
quiet moans.

But then, Katt paused, and after Nina gave her a curious look, asked. 
&quot;Nina, I was wondering if. . . I could do something special for you. . 
.&quot;

&quot;Special?&quot;

&quot;. . . Yes. . . Special. . .&quot; Katt took a deep breath, calming down a 
little bit. She was still quite flushed, and apparently the more she 
thought about this &#39;special thing&#39;, the redder she turned. Her 
expression seemed to plead [Please. . .] 

Nina thought about it for a moment, studying the Woren girl&#39;s face, 
and then nodded slowly. &quot;Now, don&#39;t worry. . .&quot; Katt told her calmly 
as she slid further down the bed, until she was facing Nina&#39;s waist. 
&quot;Just lay back, and I promise you&#39;ll enjoy this. . .&quot;

She gently turned Nina onto her back, and then, spread the blonde 
girl&#39;s legs. Nina felt a twinge of fear as well as a touch of giddy 
excitement. She knew what Katt had planned, but. . . she allowed it. 
She even felt, deep inside, that perhaps she even wanted it.

Katt laid her head just above Nina&#39;s pale patch of pubic hair, and 
closed her eyes, sighing. She gently stroked the fine hair, almost 
languidly, like it was the soft pelt of some friendly forest creature, 
and said softly. &quot;So very soft. . . How do you do it, Nina? How are 
you so soft?. . .&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Nina said a bit breathlessly, still sensitive there 
from a moment ago. &quot;Uhh. . . Good conditioner?. . .&quot;

Katt chuckled a little, and kissed abdomen, below the belly button. 
Then she began a slow series of kisses south from there, where she 
stopped at the first sign of pubic hair. She looked up at Nina, across 
the length of the girl&#39;s body, and gave her a half smile. &quot;Are you 
ready?&quot;

&quot;. . . .&quot; Nina nodded.

She moaned softly, and closed her eyes as Katt lowered her head 
between Nina&#39;s legs and began to slowly lick her there. She couldn&#39;t 
believe that this was actually happening, nor could she believe how 
agile Katt&#39;s tongue really was. Nina&#39;s back arched when Katt did a 
particularly deep probe with her tongue. Almost by reflex she reached 
down and laid her hand on top of Katt&#39;s red mop of hair; the universal 
sign of please, continue.

Katt continued to lick softly, hesitating every time Nina shuddered 
with pleasure, and then returning to that spot, to flicker her tongue 
as best she could. She stopped for a moment when Nina touched the top 
of her head, but then when Nina applied the smallest pressure, she 
recommenced her tenderly caressing with her tongue at Nina&#39;s most 
sensitive skin. The Windian girl was moaning quietly, and Katt 
couldn&#39;t help smiling a bit.

She knew Nina was near the Moment, but when Nina suddenly pulled 
Katt&#39;s head away before she could finish bringing her to climax, Katt 
wore a confused expression. Nina smiled, and shook her head. Without a 
word, she pointed one direction with one index finger, and another 
with the other. Then she arced them, one over to where the other had 
been, the other one arcing under to where the first had vacated. 
Switch. Katt blinked as she realized what Nina was suggesting.

Nina turned onto her side, as Katt scooted up the bed beside her. When 
she was up far enough, Katt asked. &quot;What are you going to do?&quot;

All Nina did was smile gently, and lean in, as if to kiss again. Katt 
closed her eyes and moved foreward to accept Nina&#39;s soft kiss, but 
instead found herself kissing empty air; Nina had changed direction 
slightly, and now began to kiss her neck, causing goosebumps wherever 
her the blonde girl&#39;s tender lips touched.

Katt moaned with pleasure as Nina worked her way up her neck to one of 
the Woren&#39;s furry ears, which she kissed the lobe and gave a devilish 
lick to, feeling it grow warmer against her lips. Nina&#39;s hands 
travelled down Katt&#39;s back, one to the base of her tail, and the other 
down her front, fingers brushing the very sensitive nipple there. She 
hooked one of her wings around at just the right angle, and with 
enough delicacy to simply brush the back of Katt&#39;s calf, gently 
ruffling the fur there.

The younger girl giggled a little at the tickling, and squirmed a bit, 
farther up the bed and out of reach of Nina&#39;s wing. But not out of 
reach of Nina. Katt&#39;s change in position had inadvertantly brought her 
chest to Nina&#39;s head level. Somewhere in the back of her mind, Katt 
wondered did she plan for that?

Whether she did or didn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t matter; Nina took advantage of 
the situation, brushing her fingers across Katt&#39;s raised nipple, 
before bringing her mouth and tongue to it. Katt gasped as Nina&#39;s 
tongue swirled lightly around the tip, and moaned as Nina gave it a 
tug with her lips, before going back to licking over and around the 
nipple. . .

***

Over the next few hours, while the rain poured down outside, Katt and 
Nina caressed, kissed, and they both learned something about each 
other that they never knew before. And in each other, they found 
something infinitely more precious.

In the early morning, Ryu crept into the apartment building in the 
hopes of not waking anyone. He knew the guys had crashed at the bar, 
but when he checked Katt&#39;s room, he found that the little Woren wasn&#39;t 
there. Wondering where she was, he checked on Nina, and discovered 
that the two of them had fallen asleep together, beneath the blankets 
on Nina&#39;s bed.

Ryu&#39;s first, dark thought was [They had lesbian sex!] but he quickly 
came to his senses, and came up with an explanation that satisfied 
him. [One of them was scared of the lightning or thunder, and wanted 
company. And they just. . . fell asleep together. That&#39;s all. . .]

*****

As the years passed, and the final Battle with Death Evans came and 
went, Ryu and Nina were married; Prince of Dragons, and Princess of 
Windia. Ryu kept Katt on as his personal confidante, advisor, trainer, 
and secretly, as his concubine, but he had no idea Nina had a secret 
of her own. Katt was not only Ryu&#39;s concubine, but also Nina&#39;s 
personal, secret lover. No one would know that the Woren shared the 
bed of the Prince and the Princess until many, many years later. . .</pre>
