<h1>Revelation of Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../breathfire/index.html">Breath of Fire</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/argoth.html">Argoth</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#39;The first time I saw her was at the Magic Academy in Hometown, that was 
when it started.  I think thats probably why I wanted us to go rescue 
her from the Jokers.  Why won&#39;t it go away, this strange feeling thats 
in my heart.  I wonder what it is? It only happens when she is around 
though. Even when we were in that battle against Joker, every time I 
looked over at Nina, that feeling showed up.  And when the Joker was 
about to attack Nina, I don&#39;t know why but I had to protect her. &quot;No, 
don&#39;t touch her!&quot; I shouted as I leaped in front of Nina, with my arms 
out.  I still don&#39;t know why I did it, something just took over, as if I 
had no control over it.  It was a good thing I did that though, because 
it completely surprised the Joker long enough for Ryu to come around him 
and slice his head off. Then, when we went to Windia...&#39;

Suddenly, Katt&#39;s thoughts were broken by Ryu saying, &quot;Katt, are you 
listening to me?&quot; &quot;Huh, I&#39;m sorry, what did you say?&quot; asked Katt, still 
not paying much attention to Ryu. &quot;I said that we are almost to 
Simafort, aren&#39;t you just as excited as I am?&quot; said Ryu anxiously. 
&quot;Yeah, sure&quot; Katt replied. &quot;Hey, where did Nina go?&quot;  &quot;Huh, I think she 
went off somewhere to get some firewood, we&#39;re gonna need to camp in 
awhile, it&#39;s almost about to get dark.&quot;  &quot;Which way did she go?&quot; Katt 
said, almost shouting. Ryu answered &quot;Um, I think she went that way, why 
are you so concerned about her?&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s nothing, so just shut up!&quot; Katt 
walked off to where Ryu had pointed to earlier. &quot;I wonder what that was 
all about&quot; was all that Ryu could say.

Why did I burst out like that to Ryu, he didn&#39;t do anything wrong. What 
came over me, and why am I so concerned with Nina? Dammit, there goes 
that funny feeling again.&#39; &quot;Hey Katt over here!&quot; shouted Nina.  Katt had 
finally found her, she ran over to where she was and started to talk to 
her.  &quot;There you are, I thought I&#39;d never find you.&quot;  &quot;Sorry Katt, I 
just had to get away from everyone for awhile.&quot;  Katt replied, &quot;Oh, I 
can understand that, I feel that way too sometimes.&quot;  &quot;Hey Katt, since 
you&#39;re here, can you help me with something?&quot;  &quot;Yeah sure what is it?&quot; 
replied Katt.  &quot;Will you help me take a bath?&quot; Katt was embarassed at 
the thought of it.  Her cheeks turned red as she asked Nina,&quot;Why do you 
need my help?&quot;  Nina replied,&quot; Because I need you to help me scrub my 
back.&quot; &quot;Oh, ok, I can do that&quot; replied Katt, somewhat relieved.  &quot;Can I 
ask you something Katt?&quot;  &quot; Sure Nina, what is it?&quot;  &quot;I was just 
wondering, do your cheeks always turn that red?&quot;  &quot;What!?!&quot; was all Katt 
could say. &quot;Hehehe, just kidding, I&#39;ll be over there getting undressed, 
make sure nobody comes over here alright.&quot;  &quot;Alright, sure&quot; replied Katt 
with her face as red as ever.

&quot;Alright Katt, I&#39;m ready&quot; said Nina from behind the trees.  Katt started 
to walk over to where she was and started thinking again.  &#39;Why was I so 
nervous when she asked me to wash her back, there isn&#39;t anything wrong 
with that.  We&#39;re just friends, thats why she asked me, yeah, I got 
nothing to worry about.&#39;

When Katt got over to the small spring where Nina was waiting for her 
she could feel her face getting red again, because there in front of her 
was the young, beautiful Windian princess, completely naked in the 
water, waiting for her.  &quot;There you are Katt, alright, there&#39;s a 
washcloth right beside, go ahead and start when you&#39;re ready.&quot;  Katt 
walked over to the water, trying to calm herself down.  When she got 
there she picked up the washcloth and got to work. &quot;Mmm, that feels real 
nice Katt,&quot; said Nina.  &quot;Um, yeah, thanks.&quot; Katt&#39;s thoughts kept turning 
to that funny feeling that she kept having, even though she kept trying 
to block it out of her mind.  Katt decided to go ahead and start talking 
in order to keep her mind off of it.  &quot;So, umm, did I mention I think 
your wings are beautiful?&quot;  &quot;Really!  No one else has ever complimented 
on my wings before, most of the time people only talk about my wings 
because of that stupid curse.&quot; &quot;Well I don&#39;t care what anybody says, I 
think they are the prettiest wings I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;  &quot;Thanks Katt, that 
means a lot to me.&quot;  Katt and Nina kept talking as Nina finished up her 
bath, and the two of them went back to where the guys had set up camp.

When they got there, they saw that Ryu and Jean had already started to 
fry up some fish that they had just caught.  &quot;Where did you two go, I 
thought you were just gonna get some firewood?&quot; asked Ryu.  &quot;Uhh, we 
just got lost, thats all,&quot; was what Nina replied.  &quot;Oh, ok, well, the 
fish will be ready in a few minutes, so we&#39;ll just sit around while it 
cooks.&quot;  The gang just sat around and talked while the food cooked.  
After they all ate, they set up their tents and went to sleep for the 
rest of the night.

The next day they packed up everything and went on the boatride to 
Simfort.  The ride there was pretty much uneventful, but things wouldn&#39;t 
stay that way for long.  When they arrived at Simfort they inside the 
castle.  Almost immediately their newest companion Jean was arrested and 
said to be executed the next day.  &quot;There has to be something we can do 
Ryu,&quot; said the concerned Nina. &quot;There&#39;s not a whole lot we can do about 
it, unless we go down there and break him out of jail,&quot; replied Ryu.  
&quot;Well then lets do that,&quot; said Nina.  &quot;Alright, but it might be 
dangerous so I&#39;ll go down there alone and check to see how we can get 
him out.&quot;  &quot;But what are we supposed to do?&quot; asked Nina.  &quot;Just hang out 
in the inn till I come back, alright?&quot;  &quot;Alright,&quot; said Katt and Nina at 
the same time.

As Katt and Nina went to the inn, Katt could begin to sense that feeling 
coming back. &#39;Damn it, that feeling is back again, and now I&#39;m stuck in 
a room with Nina all by myself.  Nah, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking 
about, there&#39;s nothing going on between us, we&#39;re just friends, I don&#39;t 
know why I&#39;m even thinking about stuff like this, I sound like I&#39;m in 
love with her or sumthin.&#39;  As Katt was thinking this she immediately 
froze in her tracks.  When Nina asked Katt if something was wrong she 
simply replied,&quot;Nah, it&#39;s nothing, nothing at all.&quot;  &#39;What the hell am I 
thinking, I must be crazy or something. I just need to focus on 
something else.&#39;  Just then Nina asked the absolute worst thing that 
wouldn&#39;t keep Katt&#39;s thoughts on Nina.  &quot;Say Katt, since Ryu might be 
gone for a good while, would you mind giving me a back rub?&quot;  &quot;What? No, 
of course not, I would love to give you a back rub.&quot; replied Katt, 
obviously ignoring everything that she had just thought out. 

&#39;Crap how did I get myself into this?  Every time we are alone, 
something like this happens... What in the hell am I thinking about?  
Theres nothing wrong, nothing at all, I should just not worry about it 
and just try to enjoy myself.&#39;  &quot;Are you ready, Katt?&quot; &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot; 
Nina then began to undo the back of her dress when Katt shouted 
out,&quot;What are you doing!?!&quot;  Nina simply replied,&quot;Undoing my dress so 
you can rub my back,  why, did you change your mind?&quot; &quot;No, it&#39;s just... 
Nah, nevermind it&#39;s nothing, I just been kinda stressed lately.&quot;  &quot;Yeah, 
I&#39;ve noticed, you&#39;ve been acting kinda strange for the past few days... 
Hey! Tell ya what, how about I give you a massage, it&#39;ll make you feel 
better.&quot;  Katt started to feel a little nervous, but then decided to go 
ahead with it and said,&quot;Yeah, I bet your right Nina, that&#39;s exactly what 
I need, thanks.&quot;  Katt began to lie down on the soft bed and Nina 
climbed up on top of her and began to massage her back.  &quot;Mmm, this 
feels great Nina, I haven&#39;t felt this good in a long time.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m glad 
you&#39;re enjoying it,&quot; replied Nina.  Nina continued to massage Katt&#39;s 
soft, furry red back.  

Katt just layed there enjoying the massage when Nina stopped and said, 
&quot;Now take off that shirt-thing.&quot;  &quot;WHAT?&quot; was all that Katt could reply 
with.  &#39;Dammit, there I go overreacting again.  What&#39;s wrong with me.  
Why do I always get nervous like this...&#39;  &quot;Katt, aren&#39;t you listening 
to me? I just need you to take it off so that I can rub the lotion onto 
yer back.&quot;  &quot;Oh, right, the lotion, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, 
nothing at all, hahahaha.&quot;  Katt turned around and quickly and began to 
undo her tunic.  After she pulled the garment off, she quickly layed 
back down onto the bed so that Nina wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t see her bare 
chest.  &quot;Alright, please continue,&quot; said Katt in a tone that kinda 
confused Nina.  Nina thought nothing of it and continued the massage.  

As Nina continued to rub Katt&#39;s bare back, Nina could her Katt mutter 
little &quot;mmm&#39;s&quot; and &quot;ahh&#39;s&quot; every now and then.  She took very little 
notice of it, thinking she was just trying to enjoy the massage.  This 
continued for a while when Nina began to yawn.  As she yawned, her hands 
began to slowly slip down Katt&#39;s back until she was nearly rubbing 
Katt&#39;s rear.  Katt felt what she was doing, but instead of trying to 
move around or stop her, she let out a deep, &quot;Puuurrrrrrr.&quot;  Hearing 
this, Nina was kinda surprised and asked, &quot;Katt, did you just Purr!&quot;  
Katt&#39;s faced turned red and before she could answer her, there was a 
knock at the door.

&quot;Girls, you in there.&quot;  It was Ryu&#39;s voice. Nina called out, &quot;We&#39;ll be 
out there in just a minute.&quot;  Nina turned over to Katt and said, &quot;Come 
on, put your top back on.&quot; Katt just nodded and got up to get dressed.  
When they exited the inn, Katt walked over to where Ryu was with Nina.  
&quot;Well, they had Jean locked up in the prison, but they agreed to let him 
go...&quot;  Nina said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s good, right?&quot;  &quot;Well, sorta, but there 
is some bad news...&quot; replied Ryu  Katt shouted out, &quot;Well what is it?&quot;  
Ryu and Nina both looked over at her, confused at why she was so 
furious.  &quot;Well, the only way we could get Jean free is if we agreed to 
a cooking contest, so we need to help Jean win it, doesn&#39;t that sound 
like fun?&quot;  

Nina could see that Katt was tensing up again, she kept wondering why 
Katt was so edgey lately, and it appeared that Nina&#39;s nice massage went 
to waste.  &quot;Why can&#39;t we just beat some people up to get him out, this 
is so stupid!&quot; Katt shouted out again.  Ryu could tell that Katt was 
upset about something, but couldn&#39;t think of what she could get so mad 
about.  He decided to continue with his explanation.

&quot;We can&#39;t just bust him out because Jean said that since this is his 
home, he doesn&#39;t wan&#39;t us to make a big commotion because people might 
get hurt.  Anyways, what we need to do to help Jean is to go down into 
the underground dungeon of this place and get him some ingredients.&quot;  
Nina&#39;s face went kinda pale as Ryu said this, and then Nina asked, in a 
soft tone &quot;w-w-what do you mean, like flour and eggs n&#39; stuff?&quot;  Ryu 
just looked at her plainly and said, &quot;No, we need to get worms and 
roaches and stuff like that.&quot;  Nina just stood there silently for a few 
seconds, then Katt went up to her and asked, &quot;Nina, is something wrong?&quot;  
Nina closed her eyes and loudly shouted out, &quot;I HATE BUGS!&quot;  Practically 
everyone&#39;s eyes in the whole room were on her.  Most of the people in 
that room just jumped when she yelled out, but since the people of 
Simafort are frogs, some of them looked at Nina like she had just 
insulted them.  Ryu had that dumbfounded look on his face again and 
asked, &quot;Nina, you ok?&quot;  Nina sat down, trying to calm herself down. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been scared of bugs ever since I was a kid.  When I was growing 
up, the castle was always kept really clean, so I rarely saw any bugs.  
Whenever I saw a bug I always freaked out and started screaming till it 
went away.  I thought to myself, &#39;If I was strong, I wouldn&#39;t have to be 
afraid of bugs.&#39;  That&#39;s one of the reasons I tried so hard at the magic 
school in Hometown.&quot;  Ryu just shook his head and said, &quot;Right, so lets 
show those bugs who&#39;s boss.&quot;  Nina now looked angry, instead of nervous 
and upset.  &quot;Didn&#39;t you listen to me!  I said I&#39;m not going down there!&quot;  
Nina stormed off and went back to their room at the inn.

Katt told Ryu that she would go talk to Nina and walked over to the inn.  
Katt sat down on the bed next to Nina.  Nina then layed her head on 
Katt&#39;s shoulder and began to sob quietly.  &quot;Why can&#39;t he understand that 
I don&#39;t want to go down there?&quot;  Katt put her arm around Nina and softly 
spoke, &quot;Don&#39;t worry Nina, I&#39;m here for you, you don&#39;t have to go down 
there if you don&#39;t want to.&quot; Nina then wrapped her arms around her and 
gave her a big hug.  &quot;Thank you Katt, thanks for being my best friend. I 
don&#39;t know what I would do without you.&quot;  Nina continued to embrace Katt 
till there was a knock on the door.  &quot;Girls, you still in there?&quot;  It 
was Ryu&#39;s voice.  Katt got up and exited the room. &quot;Listen Ryu, Nina 
really doesn&#39;t want to go down there.  And besides, you don&#39;t need her 
here for this, we can just teleport her back to Township using the 
dragon statue. Good idea, huh?  Ryu thought about it and replied with, 
&quot;That&#39;s a great idea, besides, I think it&#39;s time she took a break, she&#39;s 
been working really hard.  So I guess me, you, and Rand will be going 
down there.&quot;  Katt seemed awestruck. &quot;W-what!  I thought that both me 
and Nina could both warp back. I mean, I&#39;ve been working hard too ya 
know!&quot;  &quot;Oh, ok, if a break really means that much to you too.  I was 
just thinking that, ya know, ever since Nina has been around, you&#39;ve 
been acting weird. I just thought that you and I could hang out together 
without her for awhile.&quot;  Something in Katt seemed to snap as he said 
that.  &quot;I&#39;m Nina&#39;s friend ok, that&#39;s all.  I just want to be there with 
her, is there anything wrong with that!&quot;  Ryu seemed to have that 
confused look on his face again. &quot;Umm, when you said you want &#39;to be 
there with her&#39;, didn&#39;t you mean you want &#39;to be there for her&#39;?  Katt 
realized her slip and her face went red.  &#39;He&#39;s right.  I did say it 
like that.  But why did I say it like that?  Matbe what I&#39;m thinking is 
true.  Maybe I&#39;m... in love with...?&#39;  Katt saw that Ryu was still 
standing there, waiting for a response.  &quot;Shup up you big jerk!  We&#39;re 
leaving whether you like it or not!&quot;  Katt yelled as she stormed off, 
thinking she handled that pretty well.  

Katt went back to the room where Nina was and the two of them travelled 
to the dragon statue across the lake.  When they arrived back at 
Township, the two went up to Katt&#39;s room on the top floor.  As Katt and 
Nina walked into the room, Nina made sure to close the door behind them.  
Katt was kinda confused why she had done that, but then Nina explained, 
&quot;Well, I guess that massage in Simafort didn&#39;t work, so I&#39;ll try again.&quot;  
Katt smiled at that and said, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right Nina,&quot; thinking that 
was the reason she yelled at Ryu again, and not because she might have 
feelings for Nina.

Katt neatly took off her tunic shirt and layed down on the silky bed.  
Nina then walked over and sat on the bed, next to Katt.  Nina then 
proceeded to rub Katt&#39;s back.  Unlike last time, the remainder of the 
massage was pretty much uneventful.  After she was done, Katt thank her 
nicely and the two of them stayed in Katt&#39;s room the whole night.  Katt 
and Nina just talked and talked all night, and when it got late, Nina 
went to go change into her pajamas and had a sleepover with Katt.  This 
made Katt very nervous, but at the same time, it made her pretty happy.  

As morning came, KAtt woke up and quietly went downstairs.  She was 
surprised that when she got there, everyone was there having breakfast.  
&quot;When did you all get here?&quot;  Katt asked.  &quot;We got here early this 
morning,&quot; replied Ryu.  &quot;Really, cool, how did things go at Simafort?&quot;  
&quot;Well, sit down down and I&#39;ll tell you.  After you and Nina left, we...&quot;  
Ryu was then interupted by Nina, who had just woken up and came 
downstairs.  &quot;Morning guys.&quot;  &quot;Morning, Nina,&quot; everyone replies. &quot;So, 
what happened at Simafort?&quot;  &quot;Well, like I was saying, after you two 
left...&quot;  Just then, Bow, Ryu&#39;s best friend who is half dog, interrupts 
by saying,&quot; Hey, if we&#39;re going to go to that party, we need to leave 
now.&quot;  &quot;Ahh, right, I almost forgot.  After Bow was set free,  Kilgore 
invited us over for a party, we better go now so we don&#39;t miss any 
thing.&quot;

After they finished their breakfast, the whole group went over to 
Kikgore&#39;s house to celebrate Bow&#39;s freedom.  Later that night, Bow and 
Ryu went back to Trout&#39;s(the guy that wanted Bow arrested) house, and 
much to everyone&#39;s surprise, found out that Trout was actually a demon.  
Several days went by, when Ryu received his next assignment as a ranger.  
The forest out side of Gate had mysteriously died, and they wanted Ryu 
and Bow to found out what had happened.  The group decided to rest one 
more night before they set off for their new mission, but no one 
expected that night to turn out like this.

Ryu had already gone to bed, and Katt, Sten, Jean, Bow, and Rand were up 
playing poker.  Nina was up in her room.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong Katt, usually by 
now you&#39;d already have taken all of our G.&quot;  said Sten.  Katt just 
sighed and said, &quot;Nothing, I&#39;ve just had a lot to think about lately.&quot;  
&quot;Oh, yeah, well think about this!  Three of a kind!&quot; said Sten joyously, 
it wasn&#39;t every day that he stood a chance against Katt at poker.  Katt 
just yawned and said, &quot;Full house.&quot;  Everyone kept playing till it was 
around midnight.  Around this time, Katt asked Sten(of all people), 
&quot;Sten, when do you know you&#39;re in love with someone?&quot;  Everyone thought 
that it was kinda weird that Katt was asking this, and decided to stay 
and listen as Sten replied, &quot;Well, if you feel like you couldn&#39;t bare to 
spend a day without that special someone, and if every second away from 
that person feels like an eternity, I guess that&#39;s when you know when 
you&#39;re in love.&quot;  Everyone felt moved at Sten&#39;s little spech and then 
Bow mistakenly remarked,&quot; Wow, that Ryu is a lucky guy.&quot;  Upon hearing 
this, Katt sat back down and burried her head into her arms, acting like 
she was about to cry.

Everyone was worried at why Katt had suddenly started bawling.  It 
wasn&#39;t like Katt to cry, even if she was hurt real bad.  To see Katt 
crying for no apparent reason was really shocking to them.  Bow asked 
Katt, &quot;What&#39;s wrong, did I say something I shouldn&#39;t have?&quot;  Katt just 
kept crying and then, deep in her heart, she decided that it was true.  
She had decided to tell them that she was in love with Nina.  &quot;Guys,&quot; 
said Katt after about a minute of her sniffling.  &quot;I have to tell you 
something.&quot;  Everyone thought that she was gonna admit that she liked 
Ryu, but they were dead wrong.  Sten went ahead and barged in, trying to 
get Katt to admit it quickly so they could all go to bed.  &quot;You like 
Ryu, don&#39;t you Katt?&quot;  Much to everyone&#39;s surprise, she shook her head 
no.  She then closed her eyes, and softly spoke, &quot;No, I like Nina.&quot;  
Everyone didn&#39;t quite get it right away, so Bow said, &quot;What do you 
mean?&quot;  Katt closed her eyes again said, very loudly...

&quot;I&#39;M IN LOVE WITH NINA!&quot;

Everyone just stood there, trying to take in this sudden shock.  After 
what seemed and eternity, Sten asked Katt, &quot;How long have you loved 
her?&quot;  Katt responded by saying, &quot;I&#39;ve loved her since the first moment 
I saw her.  But I didn&#39;t realize it till about a week ago, at Simafort.  
But listen, none of you can tell Nina, or Ryu, I have to do that 
myself.&quot;  Just then, she was interrupted by the sound of footsteps 
coming from the stairs.  Nina entered the room, rubbing her eyes, and 
said, &quot;What&#39;s going on guys, I thought I heard someone shouting.&quot;  
Everyone looked over at Katt, waiting in anticipation for her answer.  
&quot;Oh, that was me shouting.  I was shouting about...&quot;  Katt&#39;s eyes darted 
across the room, until she saw the poker cards out.  &quot;About whipping 
everyone at poker, hehehe.&quot;  Nina just smiled and walked back up the 
stairs.  Before she left, she said, &quot;Well then, I going back to bed. 
Goodnight everyone.&quot;  

Everyone&#39;s eyes went back to Katt.  &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell her?&quot; asked 
Sten.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t tell her in front of everybody!&quot;  Rand finished 
putting up all the poker equipment, and as everyone went up the stairs 
to go to bed, Rand said, &quot;Ya know, you&#39;re gonna have to tell her sooner 
or later.  Goodnight Katt.&quot;  &quot;Goodnight Rand.&quot;  Katt replied, rather 
sullenly.  Before she went upstairs, she sat and thought about what Rand 
had just said to her.  

&#39;I need to tell her soon.  Rand&#39;s right.  I better tell her first thing 
in the morning, before it&#39;s too late.&quot; Katt got up and went to her room 
upstairs.  As Katt layed awake, trying to get to sleep, her thoughts 
kept turning to her love.  She wondered why things happened this why.  
Why she had fallen for Nina.  She finally dozed off to sleep with one 
thought in her mind... She thought, &#39;Will Nina accept my love?&#39;

Katt awoke early the next morningm and made sure to get downstairs 
before anyone else.  She sat down at the table in the main hall, and 
waited for everyone to wake up for breakfast.  Katt just sat there, 
sipping on her tea, as one by one, everyone came downstairs.  The first 
to come down was Sten.  When he got down, he immediately asked her, &quot;Did 
you tell her?&quot;  Katt just sat there and sadly shaked her head no.  When 
Bow, Rand, and Jean came down, they also asked the question, &quot;Did you 
tell her?&quot;  Each time, Katt didn&#39;t even look, and just shook her head.  
Finally, Nina came down, and when she did, no one took their eyes off of 
Katt.  They all waited in anticipation, waiting for Katt to tell her.  
Everyone finished their breakfast, and much to there disapointment, Katt 
didn&#39;t say a thing about her crush.  

&quot;Well, we need to get going so... How about, me, Bow, Katt, and Nina,&quot; 
said Ryu as they were about to depart for their new mission.  Katt 
walked up to Ryu and asked him, very calmly, &quot;Ryu, I need to talk to 
Nina for awhile, would you mind not taking us along this time?&quot;  Ryu 
replied, &quot;Well, if you really need to , then I understand.&quot;  Katt smiled 
a little and said, &quot;Thanks Ryu.&quot;  Ryu Went back into the main hall and 
said, &quot;Change of plans, me, Bow, Rand, and Sten will be going instead.&quot;  
Everyone wished each other good luck, and the four left for their new 
quest.

As they watched them depart, Katt asked Nina, &quot;Can I talk to you for a 
minute?&quot;  Katt looked over at Jean, hinting for him to leave.  &quot;Oh, 
today looks like a nice day for a swim, see ya.&quot;  Katt and Nina walked 
back to the house, and into the hall.  &quot;So, what do you want to talk 
about?&quot; asked Nina.  Katt took a deep breath, and prepared to finally 
tell Nina how she felt.

&quot;Nina, we&#39;ve known each other for a long time, and we&#39;ve become very 
close, right?&quot;  Nina replied, &quot;Yeah, I guess so.  Why do you ask?&quot;  Katt 
closed her eyes, and said to Nina, &quot;Nina, I... I...&quot;  &quot;Yes Katt, what is 
it?&quot;  Katt sighed deeply and finally, expressed what she had been 
feeling for so long.  &quot;Nina, I love you.&quot;  Katt watched Nina carefully, 
trying to see how she would respond.  Then, Nina smiled and said, &quot;I 
love you too Katt.  I&#39;ve loved since the very first time I saw you.  I 
just didn&#39;t know how to tell you, you can&#39;t imagine how happy I am.&quot;   

Then, the moment that Katt had been waiting for had finally come.  Katt 
would finally get to express her love for Nina.  Katt stepped forward 
slightly, and looked at Nina to see if she knew what was coming.  Katt 
looked into Nina&#39;s eyes, and Nina slowly nodded her head &#39;yes&#39;.  Katt 
leaned forward slowly,  and pressed her lips against Nina&#39;s.  It was a 
soft, more loving kiss at first, but then, as Katt pulled herself away 
from Nina, she looked into Nina&#39;s eyes.  As Katt looked at her, she 
could tell that Nina wanted her as much as she did.  Katt then 
immediately locked her lips with Nina&#39;s again, except this time, each of 
them held nothing back.  Instead of being more calom and gently, This 
kiss was way more agressive.  Both Katt and Nina wrapped their arms 
around each other as they continued their open-mouthed kiss.  Katt then 
proceeded to stick her tongue out, and as she did this, she could feel 
Nina&#39;s heartbeat get faster.  Nina then reponded in kind by sticking out 
her tongue as well.  Both their tongues swirled around each other in the 
heat of passion.  Katt kept inserting her tongue deeper and deeper as 
their kiss continued, and Nina just kept trying to chase Katt&#39;s tongue 
around.  Without them knowing, as they kept kissing, Nina kept backing 
up, and Katt kept advancing till Katt had Nina up against the wall.  The 
kiss seemed to last an eternity, but finally, after their long game of 
tongue war, Katt closed her mouth, broke off the kiss, and looked up to 
stare into Nina&#39;s eyes.  Katt then whispered softly, &quot;I love you.&quot;  Nina 
just smiled and said, &quot;I love you too.&quot;

Katt and Nina walked out of the house, and just as they did, they saw 
Jean running up to the house. &quot;Ah that was a good swim,&quot; said Jean.  
Jean saw that Katt and Nina were holding hands and to this he responded, 
&quot;Ah, I guess you finally told her.&quot;  Katt and Nina just smiled and 
gripped each other&#39;s hand tighter.  Katt then said, &quot;Oh Jean, by the 
way, we might be a little late for dinner.  I&#39;m going to go show Nina 
this secret place out in the woods.  See ya.&quot;  Katt and Nina then walked 
off toward the woods together.

As Katt and Nina aproached the woods, Nina asked, &quot;Where are we going?&quot;  
Katt just replied, &quot;It&#39;s a secret.&quot;  As they went through the woods, 
Katt quickly leaped from spot to spot, and easily made it toward the 
end.  Nina on the other hand, found it very difficult to make it 
through.  At several spots, Nina had to stop and yell out to Katt, &quot;Wait 
up, I&#39;m stuck&quot;  Katt would then go back and help Nina get through the 
rough spots.  Sometimes, to get Nina through, Katt would have to carry 
Nina through the woods.  When Nina layed in Katt&#39;s arms, Nina would 
reply, &quot;Thanks love,&quot; and follow with a light kiss on the cheek.  
Finally, they were almost at the place Katt was talking about.  &quot;All we 
gotta do is jump over these low branches and we&#39;re there.&quot;  Katt then 
ducked down a little, and leapt about 10 feet into the air, then landed 
on the branches.  &quot;Come on up Nina.&quot;  Nina just looked up at Katt like 
she was crazy or something.  &quot;I can&#39;t get up there&quot;  Katt looked down 
and said, &quot;Oh, yer right. Well... Why don&#39;t you fly up here?&quot;  Nina said 
back to her, &quot;You sure?&quot;  Katt replied, &quot;I&#39;m positive you could do it.&quot;  
Nina then took a deep breath, and began to flutter her wings.  She 
jumped up, and much to her surprise, she was actually flying up there.   
Nina got up to the top, and saw Katt there waiting for her.  She fell 
down to the branches that Katt was on, and when she fell down to her, 
her arms wrapped around Katt.  Nina lifted up her head and said, &quot;Thanks 
Katt.&quot;

The walked just a few more steps, then Nina could see why Katt wanted to 
bring her there.  Nina gazed out at a long, beautiful beach.  Nina could 
see the sun reflecting off the beautiful, blue ocean. Nina could just 
say, &quot;Wow, this is beautiful.&quot;  Katt said to her, &quot;I&#39;m glad you like 
it.&quot;  The two of them walked out onto the sand, holding hands again, 
then they layed down together and watched the ocean together.  &quot;This is 
great Katt.&quot;  Katt just nodded and placed her arm around Nina.  Nina 
looked up into Katt&#39;s eyes and said, &quot;Thank you Katt.&quot;  Nina then rested 
her head on Katt&#39;s shoulder and looked out at the ocean for awhile.  

After Nina was finally ready to go, she sat up and looked over at Katt.  
&quot;I love you so much,&quot; said Nina, as she gazed now into Katt&#39;s eyes.  
Katt looked back at her and said, &quot;I love you too.&quot;  Katt brought 
herself closer  and touched her lips to Nina&#39;s.  Katt and Nina continued 
their kiss as the sun began to set in the distance.
