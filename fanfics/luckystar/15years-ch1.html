<h1>Fifteen Years After (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../luckystar/index.html">Lucky Star</a>

<pre>Kagami Hiiragi sighed, her long purple hair neatly tied back in a pony 
tail as the young teacher returned to her home in Kasukabe, not too far 
from the temple she had been raised in. She walked up the steps and was 
about to open the front door when someone opened it up from within, 
pausing to give her a saucy smile.

&quot;Welcome home, master.&quot; Konata Izumi said with a wink, the woman&#39;s long 
blue hair flowing down her back.

Kagami blushed as she hurried inside, pushing Konata out of sight from 
the street. She yelped, &quot;Do you have to do that?!&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Konata smiled as she closed the door behind them. The smaller 
woman twirled around as she added archly, &quot;I hope you appreciate I got 
the school uniform out just for you.&quot; The white and burgandy uniform 
brought back a lot of memories for them both, while also being just a 
bit on the kinky side.

&quot;You&#39;re lucky it still fits you,&quot; Kagami blustered but she blushed 
faintly as well. While Konota was still small in stature, much like her 
mother was, she had filled out quite a bit since their school days and 
in her old uniform it was very noticeable.

A smirk teased Konata&#39;s lips, the other woman well aware of where Kagami 
had been looking at her body. &quot;Come on,&quot; she turned, the skirt cut short 
enough to reveal a flash of panty, &quot;our dinner&#39;s nearly ready.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kagami blushed as she took off her shoes and put on a waiting 
pair of slippers. Unlike herself Konata worked from their home as a 
manga artist, a successful one too, which also left her time for many 
household duties. Kagami often felt a bit guilty about that, but she was 
willing to admit she was a horrid hosekeeper.

&quot;How&#39;s Principal Kuroi doing?&quot; Konata asked as she stepped into the 
kitchen and quickly checked on the dishes cooking away.

&quot;Nanako&#39;s fine,&quot; Kagami answered, thinking of the blonde, slightly ditzy 
former teacher, &quot;she mentioned she was going to call you about that new 
RPG game.&quot;

&quot;Nanako...,&quot; Konata shook her head as she uncovered a pot and sampled 
it, &quot;I still find it a bit strange to call her that.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Kagami agreed as she watched her fondly from where 
she stood leaning up against the kitchen door, &quot;I&#39;m just glad she&#39;s the 
Principal now. If we were teachers together it&#39;d be too strange.&quot;

&quot;So is Nanako finally dating someone?&quot; Konata asked her curiously as she 
dished up the food for them both.

&quot;Funny you should ask that,&quot; Kagami said mildly as she efficiently 
cleared the table of any newspapers and other items, &quot;since she got 
divorced it seems your cousin Yui has been spending a lot of time with 
her.&quot;

Konata had the oddest look on her face as she carried the plates over, 
&quot;You think that she and Miss Kuroi are....?&quot;

&quot;She certainly took learning about us pretty calmly,&quot; Kagami noted 
wryly. They sat down together, smiling across the table as they settled 
into eating. &quot;So that makes three couples from our class?&quot;

&quot;Us, Yui and Nanako and Yutaka and Minami?&quot; Konata nodded.

&quot;Yup.&quot; Kagami agreed. She looked curious, &quot;Is Hiyori still using the two 
of them as models for her adult dojinshi?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she emailed me a few scans,&quot; Konata answered. &quot;Say aww,&quot; she said 
as she held up a chopstick laden with food.

&quot;Aaah,&quot; Kagami felt foolish as her girlfriend fed her.

Konata smiled as she darted forward to kiss her gently. &quot;Eat up,&quot; she 
purred, &quot;I have a very special dessert planned.&quot;

&quot;Konata!&quot; Kagami blushed furiously from the suddem kiss, not to mention 
Konata&#39;s daring tongue. &quot;You were working on drawing one of those 
ero-mangas again, weren&#39;t you?&quot; she grumbled, &quot;They always get you 
worked up.&quot;

&quot;Well, you weren&#39;t here to take care of me so...,&quot; Konata battered her 
eyes sweetly at the other woman.

&quot;Aaargh,&quot; Kagami sighed. &quot;And what do you mean, special desert?&quot; she 
asked her suspiciously.

&quot;Wait and see,&quot; Konata smirked.

&#39;Do I even want to know?&#39; Kagami thought wryly, thinking of some of the 
other surprises Konata had sprung on her. From appearing at the door 
naked to drafting Patty for a threesome, Konata just loved pushing 
boundaries.

&quot;Could you clear the table?&quot; Konata asked cheerfully. &quot;I have to go get 
ready.&quot;

Kagami raised her eyebrows but nodded, &quot;Right.&quot;

It took only a few minutes to clear the dishes away and rinse the plates 
before loading them in the washer. She scraped out the rice cooker and 
finished clearing the cooking pans then Kagami took a deep breath and 
left the kitchen.

&quot;Konata?&quot; Kagami called, standing nervously in the living room.

&quot;In here,&quot; Konata called, her voice coming from the bedroom.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Kagami thought, feeling a thrill of excitement. She hurried 
over and opened up the door...

Konata smiled, wearing bunny ears, elbow length gloves, stockings and 
nothing else. &quot;What took you so long? Your brigade leader is impatient!&quot; 
she growled.

&quot;You are such a freak,&quot; Kagami laughed as she shut the door firmly 
behind her.

End.

Notes: First of all, IMHO I do think Konata and Kagami are pretty much 
canon. Miss Nanako Kuroi, however, probably isn&#39;t. *lol* If I ever get 
tempted I may actually do the sex scene is a full-blown lemon. Probably 
won&#39;t be on , simply because I think they&#39;d delete it.
