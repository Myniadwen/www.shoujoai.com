<h1>Fifteen Years After (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../luckystar/index.html">Lucky Star</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../luckystar/15years-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Nanako Kuroi watched as the teachers filed out of the staff meeting, the 
older blonde still feeling vaguely odd sitting in the principal&#39;s spot. 
As a well dressed young woman with purple hair was about to leave she 
called, &quot;Hiiragi, could I see you a moment?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am?&quot; Kagami asked a bit nervously.

Nanako hid a smile, Kagami had known Nanako back when she was her 
friends&#39; teacher and still treated her with a degree of reserve. It was 
kind of cute, honestly. &quot;How busy has Konata been?&quot; Nanako asked 
briskly.

&quot;She&#39;s doing a fair bit of writing,&quot; Kagami nodded cautiously, &quot;why?&quot;

Nanako gave a impish grin, &quot;Well, I just found out about a new online 
RPG she might be interested in.&quot;

Kagami sighed as she muttered, &quot;You never change.&quot; She blushed furiously 
as she realized she had said it aloud.

Thankfully Nanako just laughed, knowing Kagami was right. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s 
true,&quot; she grinned. Tidying up her papers she added, &quot;I&#39;ll call her 
about it, okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll let her know,&quot; Kagami agreed as she retreated from the staff room 
before she embarrassed herself any more.

Nanako bit back a laugh, shaking her head ruefully. Having students as 
co-workers tended to generate just such interesting moments. She 
collected her stuff and rose, going to her office to pick up the rest. 
There she hesitated a moment, then hurried over to the computer.

Looking up friends&#39; blogs was technically forbidden, but as principal 
she had some latitude. With a grin she checked several blogs, laughing 
as she found Konata&#39;s. &#39;Surprising Kagami in a Haruhi costume?&#39; she 
thought, &#39;Bad girl.&#39; Apparently the two of them were still in the 
honeymoon phase of the relationship, at least that was the impression 
she got, reading the blog and about Konata&#39;s various erotic escapades.

Rather reluctantly Nanako signed out, getting up and walking out of her 
office. She nodded to the custodian, Minoru Shiraishi, then headed out 
to the parking lot, her eyes widening as she saw who was waiting there 
for her.

Yui Narumi leaned up against her car, the green haired woman smiling 
wryly as she stood up straight. &quot;What took you so long?&quot; she asked as 
she pushed her round framed glasses up.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nanako said as she jogged over to Yui&#39;s side, &quot;the meeting ran 
a little long....&quot;

Yui flashed a smile as she used her remote to open the car doors and 
added, &quot;And you couldn&#39;t resist checking online.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Nanako said, surprising Yui by climbing in the driver&#39;s 
side.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Yui protested.

Nanako pulled her in too, &quot;Hey, yourself. The last time I let you drive 
we ended up in the middle of a police chase.&quot;

Yui pouted as she settled into her seat, &quot;At least we caught the 
criminal.&quot;

They both did up their seat belts as Nanako started up the cute little 
volkswagon and they headed out away from the school. &quot;Maybe,&quot; she 
conceded as they left the lot, &quot;but it was a bit too much for me.&quot;

Her gaze softened a bit as she met Hanako&#39;s eyes, &quot;Sorry, love.&quot;

Glad they were far enough from the school to be safe Nanako pulled over 
to the side of the road then twisted in her seat to kiss Yui gently. &quot;I 
forgot to thank you for coming for me,&quot; she smiled sheepishly.

Yui smirked suddenly as she kissed her again passionately, &quot;But you 
haven&#39;t come yet, today.&quot;

&quot;Yui!&quot; Nanako squeaked, blushing as the other woman pulled back.

Chuckling to herself Yui sat back, &quot;You&#39;d better hurry and get us home 
soon or I won&#39;t be responsible for my actions.&quot;

Hanako blushed once more as she started up the car and sent them back up 
onto the road. &quot;You&#39;ve certainly changed a lot from the married lady I 
knew,&quot; she noted.

Yui smiled back warmly as the hurried along, &quot;Not really.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Nanako raised a eyebrow.

Yui looked thoughtful, &quot;I think I was always aware how close I was to 
you. Otherwise I don&#39;t think I would have let you talk me into all those 
summer trips and stuff.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Nanako chuckled as she took them through a interchange then up 
the street to the apartment building they lived in.

Pooling their money as police and principal they could afford a somewhat 
more spacious apartment than they could alone. It had a proper living 
room and dining room, a good sized bedroom and a spare bedroom Nanako 
used as a office and storage space.

&quot;What would you like for dinner?&quot; Nanako asked as she took off her coat, 
her white blouse clinging a bit to her skin. A simple tie hung between 
her breasts, the tan color matching her dress pants. She walked into the 
kitchen and opened up the fridge, peering inside and she mused, &quot;I 
suppose we could heat some tv dinners....&quot;

&quot;I know what I want,&quot; Yui grinned as she grabbed Nanako from behind.

&quot;Eeek!&quot; Nanako squealed as she breasts were squeezed firmly, Her knees 
got weak as her nipples were gently tweaked, a kiss landing on her neck.

Yui turned her around to kiss her feverishly, unbuttoning her shirt to 
reveal a fancy lace bra. &quot;I have a lot of years to make up for,&quot; she 
murmured as she kissed her way downward, gently popping each breast 
free.

Nanako moaned weakly as she sank to the floor, Yui ardently nibbling on 
her full breasts. &quot;Stop,&quot; she gasped, &quot;we want to eat....&quot;

&quot;I know exactly what I want to eat,&quot; Yui purred seductively as she 
popped the top button then undid the zipper of Nanako&#39;s pants.

The first lick nearly fried Nanako&#39;s mental circuits, and she decided 
that resistance was futile. Laying back she shuddered as Yui hit a 
particularly sensitive spot and decided to just go with the flow.... so 
to speak.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Yui smiled as she kissed her delicate folds, &quot;delicious.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Nanako lay in a limp puddle on the floor, glad it had warmed up a bit 
from their laying on it. &quot;I think I pulled something,&quot; she admitted as 
they sat up.

Yui gave a soft laugh, &quot;Probably when you flipped me over and ravaged 
me.&quot; She looked at the mess they made, &quot;I always though using cucumbers 
like that was a urban myth....&quot;

&quot;Guess not,&quot; Nanako said as she tried to straighten up her half on, half 
off clothes. Deciding it was a waste of effort she stripped, picking up 
the clothes as she added, &quot;Do you want me to slice it up into the 
salad?&quot;

Yui laughed, &quot;Nah, it&#39;ll only remind me the salad doesn&#39;t taste as good 
as you.&quot;

&quot;Smooth,&quot; Nanako laughed, feeling Yui gazing at her bottom. She wiggled 
it for good measure as she said, &quot;Let&#39;s get into some pajamas and 
relax.&quot;

Yui only reluctantly got up, &quot;I&#39;m plenty relaxed as it is.&quot;

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Nanako laughed as Yui followed her in to the bedroom, slowing 
as she saw Nanako getting into her nightie.

Yui looked her over thoughtfully through the nearly transparent cloth, 
&quot;Are you trying to tempt me again?&quot;

&quot;Dinner first,&quot; Nanako said firmly, &quot;temptation later.&quot;

&quot;Spoil sport,&quot; yui laughed as she caught her in a hug. &quot;I love you,&quot; she 
purred as she held her gently.

&quot;Love you too,&quot; Nanako murmured contentedly.

End

Notes: What can I say, the idea of writing these two was nearly 
irresistible. Note that Konata probably will be posting her own 
seduction of Kagami online, so I have a excuse to write a chapter three.
