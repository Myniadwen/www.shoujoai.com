<h1>How to Say Goodbye</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yuyu/index.html">Yu Yu Hakusho</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kooritenshi.html">Koori Tenshi</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She was gorgeous. Simply gorgeous. I couldn&#146;t stop staying at the 
picture of her when I first saw her. Who knew a Koorime, an ice 
apparition, could be so breathtaking? I knew I was in love with her the 
second I saw her on the videotape. When I saw her in person less then 
three days later, I knew I had to stay close to her always.

...But always is never long enough, is it?

Maybe I should introduce myself to you. My name is Botan. Many people 
know me by other names though...such as Death or the Grim Reaper. I&#146;m 
not all morbid like one might think from the title. On the contrary, I 
try to be quite cheerful and perky all the time. But even I have my 
moments that a flaw of unwanted sadness peaks through my happy mask. 
Like when I saw Yukina Jaganshi, Hiei Jaganshi&#146;s younger sister. I 
thought my heart would burst from my chest.

Now mind you, I had never thought a female could affected me that way. 
I had always thought I was as strait as an arrow. Heh...guess Fate 
changes it&#146;s mind a lot. I had never even looked at another girl as 
more then a friend. Then again, I never really had any friends besides 
my boss, Koenma-sama. My only true friends came after I met Yusuke 
Urameshi. 

Hmm...Speaking of Yusuke, a lot of people thought I liked him more then 
a friend at first...including my boss. So did Ayame-san. But no, Yusuke 
already had his soul mate when I met him. Keiko Yukimura. Nothing could 
tear them apart. They had one of the strongest bonds I have ever seen.

Kazuma Kuwabara was my third friend since Keiko became my second. He 
proposed to me the first time we met even! Well, needless to say, I am 
NOT the type of girl to except a proposal by a complete stranger. 
Friends, yes, husband and wife, no.

Kurama Minamino, or Youko Kurama, I should say, made me do a double 
take when I first saw him. I swore he was a girl. No, I really did. 
Don&#146;t laugh! It&#146;s not that funny! Kurama had, and still has, the long 
red hair and bright green eyes that would make any guy or girl melt. 
I&#146;ll admit, I did swoon for a bit after I found out he was a male. 
But...well, that was it. I never liked him as more then a close friend.

Hiei Jaganshi scares me. Yep, still does. Well, wouldn&#146;t YOU be scared 
out of your wits if he threatened to kill you for talking too much? I 
don&#146;t talk too much! He just doesn&#146;t talk enough. Oh...And he 
threatened to use his KokoRyuhaa on me. Even scarier!

Yukina, though, is different from all of my friends. She...is just so 
sweet and innocent...and has the air of needing to be protected around 
her even though she is much stronger then she gives herself credit for. 
I felt like I was melting when she smiled at me for the first time. It 
was...just...I wish time could have stopped and let her smile last 
forever.

But then again if it _had_ stopped, I never would have got to kiss her. 
Yep, you heard me. I kissed her. Smack dab on the lips too. Didn&#146;t see 
that coming, huh? Or did you? Probably did...I&#146;m not good at surprises. 
And guess what? She kissed me back! She&#146;s a damn good kisser. For a 
race of all females, I guess being a lesbian is normal. Koorimes 
reproduce a-sexually, but I never thought about that. Being alone all 
of one&#146;s life on a island with only other females would probably make 
you naturally want to be with one of them. Being alone is boring.

ANYWAY, back to the kiss I was talking about before I got distracted, 
she knew how to use her tongue too, which caught me completely off 
guard. Heh...I guess people are right when they say kisses normally end 
up to more then just kissing. We won&#146;t go into details with that little 
topic though. It&#146;s private. Meow!

...I never thought about how the others would feel...Kuwabara was 
really upset, Yusuke couldn&#146;t stop laughing, Keiko just blushed, Kurama 
just smiled, and...well...Hiei threatened to kill me _again_ if I ever 
left her. I didn&#146;t plan on leaving her anyway. ...But...

Death can&#146;t stop death. 

The day I saw her paper in Koenma-sama&#146;s office, my heart shattered 
into a million pieces. My entire life stopped. She was going to die. 
And I was assigned to ferry her soul to the Reikai. Could Fate be any 
more cruel? ...Yep...

She was crying as I comforted her spirit. She didn&#146;t want to leave me. 
I, being Death, could not visit her in Heaven. And once she was 
reincarnated, she would forget everything about me. Our life 
together...All forgotten...I cried too. Tears mixed with precious 
jewels that I gathered after she was safely in Heaven. God, I wanted to 
die right then and there. But Death can&#146;t die either.

So I&#146;ll wait. I&#146;ll wait right here. Even if she won&#146;t remember me, I 
would like to meet her reincarnation. Perhaps...perhaps some part of 
her will remember me...till then, I will have to say goodbye.</pre>
