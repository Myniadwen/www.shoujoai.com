<h1>Old Times, New Times (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yuyu/index.html">Yu Yu Hakusho</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kittsseh.html">Kitt Sseh</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      Hinageishi held Botan against her chest, wrapping her arms 
around her as a mother might protect a newborn child. Flying through 
the air on her oar, she hurried to Genkai&#39;s temple. She kissed Botan&#39;s 
fevered forehead gently and looked down at her with love.

       &quot;Oh, Botan. I&#39;m so sorry. After all you&#39;ve done for me, I 
couldn&#39;t repay you. But where was I when you where in trouble?&quot; 
Hinageishi held Botan tighter to herself as she sobbed.

       Hinageishi and Botan had trained in the spirit world together. 
Botan, in training to be the messenger of death, had been successful 
in her studies. Hinageishi however was a different story. Few people 
would send Hinageishi on errands, for she always messed up even the 
simplest tasks. Hinageishi had almost given up in despair, but Botan 
ensured her that she could succeed. Hinageishi had believed her. After 
all, if Botan had faith in her it must be true.

       By working together they had both received there separate 
titles of Death and Guide for the Spirit World. Their jobs kept them 
away from each other. But both of them had their memories of each 
others friendship. Now Hinageishi hoped to repay Botan for her 
kindness.

       Seeing Genkai&#39;s temple in the distance, Hinageishi headed 
downwards. Even with the wind tossing her around, She made sure she 
landed carefully.

       Genkai looked out the shrine&#39;s sliding doors in surprise.

       &quot;Hinageishi? Were Yusuke and the others able to destroy the 
Netherworld?&quot;

       &quot;Yes, but there&#39;s no time to explain. Botan still needs help.&quot; 
Hinageishi lifted herself and Botan off the oar and walked into the 
temple. She laid Botan down on the nearest futon. Turning around, she 
explained the situation.

       &quot;The others are making their way back here by themselves. Since 
Botan was still hurt, I offered to bring her here.&quot; Actually she had 
begged to be the one to bring Botan. Yusuke had been reluctant at 
first, but she&#39;d been able to persuade him. What Genkai didn&#39;t know 
wouldn&#39;t hurt her.

       Arms folded across her chest, Genkai walked around Botan. She 
walked over to a cabinet and pulled out several rolls of bandages, 
gesturing for Hinageishi to pick up the rest of the contents.

       &quot;She&#39;ll live, but that sphere weakened her. We need to bandage 
her wounds and try to get some water in her.&quot;

       &quot;Yay! Botan&#39;ll be OK!&quot; Hinageishi beamed.

       &quot;There&#39;s one more thing. Yukina&#39;s still resting from the last 
attack. I&#39;ll need you to help me in her place.&quot;

       &quot;M-me?!&quot; Hinageishi sweat dropped.

       &quot;Yes. I myself am still weak. You do want Botan to live, don&#39;t 
you?&quot; Genkai smirked.

       &quot;I. sure I do.&quot; Hinageishi took a deep breath. Closing her 
eyes, she gave a solemn nod. &#39;If this is how I can repay Botan... I 
have to try. Oh Botan, You can&#39;t leave me yet.&#39;

       Hinageishi was now Genkai&#39;s legs and arms. At the slightest 
mention from Genkai, she fetched tools and medicine. Held flashlights 
where Genkai needed them. Whenever the water and bandages were used 
up, she raced around the temple searching for more. It was exhausting 
work.

       After an hour, Genkai had done all she could do. Hinageishi 
breathed a sigh of relief.

       &quot;Now we just wait and see. Get some rest, Hinageishi.&quot; With a 
sigh Genkai walked off to her own room. Looking down at Botan, 
Hinageishi began to panic.

       &#39;What if she needs something in the night? What if she gets 
worse? She. she&#39;d be helpless.&#39; Hinageishi sat down next to Botan. &#39;In 
that case, it&#39;s my job to see that she&#39;ll be safe.&#39; Hinageishi stroked 
Botans hair.

       Keeping a diligent watch, Hinageishi thought back to the old 
days. How Botan had always guided and protected her. All the fun times 
they had, goofing off and pulling pranks. On the outside they both 
seemed respectable in every way(1). But on the inside Hinageishi and 
Botan had mischievous streaks.

       Hinageishi wondered when she first started admiring Botan. Was 
it when she convinced the others that Hinageishi could learn how to be 
spirit guide? Was it when Botan lured her into a friendship? But one 
thing she did understand was that she wasn&#39;t sure if she was happy 
just being Botan&#39;s friend.

       She wanted to be more than that. Back in the old days, she 
couldn&#39;t protect Botan like Botan protected her. But whenever Botan 
was down, Hinageishi tried her hardest to cheer her up. When Botan 
smiled, Hinageishi would feel her heart soar.

       When they had parted ways she still thought of Botan often. Was 
she smiling now? Did she enjoy her job? When would she see her again? 
However, Hinageishi never expected their reunion to be like this.

       Laying her head on the side of Botan&#39;s pillow Hinageishi 
thought about Botan more. She knew she loved Botan with all her heart. 
While she&#39;d never disliked males, she didn&#39;t want to be with anyone 
but Botan. But would Botan feel the same?

       She didn&#39;t know what she&#39;d do if Botan rejected her. But these 
feelings had to come out. Or she&#39;d go insane.

       Rolling closer to Botan for warmth, she decided to tell her 
when Botan woke up. If she was rejected, then well. She&#39;d leave Botan 
alone. If Botan would be happier with another, Hinageishi would have 
to accept that. No matter how much it hurt.

       A tear rolled down Hinageishi&#39;s cheek as she unwillingly 
drifted off to sleep.

A/N - Yes, I&#39;m leaving you there. Because I&#39;m evil.

(1) *snort* Yeaaah. Right.

As always, comments and criticisms are welcome. Sorry if anything was 
confusing.</pre>
