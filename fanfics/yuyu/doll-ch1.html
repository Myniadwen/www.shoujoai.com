<h1>Doll</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yuyu/index.html">Yu Yu Hakusho</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kuwa.html">Kuwa-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It could very well get her killed, what she was doing. At 
the very least, it would make a certain someone absolutely 
furious. 

But with the little doll-like girl sleeping so peacefully, 
snow white cheeks pillowed on thin hands, it was very easy 
to imagine Hiei&#39;s guaranteed explosion and just laugh.

Well, for Mukuro, it was easy to imagine just about 
anything Hiei did and laugh. 

In fact, that&#39;s what she was doing right now: imagining the 
look on Hiei&#39;s face if he were to walk right into this room 
and see his boss treating his baby sister like an extra-
cuddly doll. And between the flushed face, the twitching 
eye and the clenching fist, she was having a hell of a time 
trying not to laugh hysterically. 

But the lady&#39;s attempts to stifle her giggles were failing 
miserably, and eventually, Yukina woke up. 

&quot;Mukuro-sama?&quot; she asked sleepily. Yukina was endlessly 
formal and respectful. Even now, when the combined efforts 
of the two women succeeded in finally tricking Hiei to 
reveal his darkest secret, the girl called him &quot;Hiei-san.&quot; 
Mukuro suspected that it bothered Hiei that she addressed 
him so impersonally (they were twins), but she could never 
get a definite reading on the situation. 

It bothered her, though, that Yukina didn&#39;t see fit to drop 
the formal title. But then again, she reminded herself, she 
called her closest friend &quot;Kazuma-san&quot; up until the day he 
died. 

&quot;What is it, dear?&quot; 

&quot;What are you laughing about?&quot; The room was dark, and 
Mukuro could barely make out Yukina&#39;s eyes. Just enough 
light filtered in for the demon lady to see the ice 
maiden&#39;s head titled ever so slightly to the side, her 
long, wavy mat of green hair slipping over her shoulder. 

&quot;What would happen if Hiei walked in right now,&quot; she 
answered honestly. &quot;What do you think he&#39;d do?&quot;

&quot;Close the door and ignore it,&quot; she answered matter-of-
factly. &quot;Then open it up again and ask what on earth is 
going on.&quot; 

&quot;I thought he&#39;d explode, see, and perhaps burn the entire 
place down.&quot; 

&quot;He&#39;d wait for an answer first,&quot; Yukina giggled. &quot;He&#39;s 
temperamental, not unreasonable.&quot;

Mukuro raised an eyebrow. &quot;Are you so sure of that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; Yukina exclaimed. &quot;It really is, Mukuro-sama, 
he&#39;s not that bad.&quot; 

&quot;If you say so, my dear,&quot; replied Mukuro. She pulled the 
small maiden toward her, wrapping her up in a bear hug, and 
smiling at the soft sigh. Yukina was just about the size of 
a large doll. And much more cuddly-she hugged back.  

Yup. Hiei was definitely going to kill her. 

Oh, well. Let him try.

&quot;What makes you think he wouldn&#39;t want to kill me, anyway?&quot; 
Yukina said suddenly, pulling back. &quot;He&#39;s rather protective 
of you, too. Like an elder sister.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re blood,&quot; she said simply. &quot;He takes that just as 
seriously as you do.&quot; 

The ice maiden nodded and smiled. &quot;But still, I would like 
to think he would approve. He respects you very much.&quot; she 
trailed off.

And Mukuro got the message Yukina would never even think, 
but instinctively knew: If Hiei didn&#39;t approve, everything 
was off. To Yukina, her love was not her own. It was her 
brother&#39;s, and only to be distributed at his discretion. He 
had been deprived of it for so long! She could go around 
behind his back without feeling guilty-rather, liking the 
excitement of sharing such a special secret-but directly 
defy him to his face? 

Never. 

And to Mukuro&#39;s great amusement, Hiei was exactly the same 
way. If he ever, heaven forbid, actually liked someone at 
all, and Yukina didn&#39;t, he would immediately cut all 
contact with the one who had offended his beloved sister. 
Yukina alone had the power of life and death over everyone 
the fire demon met: she could order someone cruelly 
murdered or she could grant clemency to the person Hiei 
hated most.  If Yukina said it, it must be done, in Hiei&#39;s 
eyes. 

Mukuro chuckled a little. Hiei and Yukina were still much 
like children in her eye, and their story, as it unfolded 
each day, was incredibly engaging. Particularly the antics 
of the pretty little ice maiden. She had a mission: she was 
going to be loved, by golly, if it killed her. 

Between a dead mother, an absentee father, a standoffish 
brother and a depressed guardian, Yukina was still very 
unsure of what it mean to love and to be loved. The 
Kuwabara family, who took her in as one of their own during 
their lives, had given her a taste of that, but it had 
taken the little maiden so long to understand. 

Her standoffish brother, as much as he adored his twin, 
just could not be brought to show it. He did not know how, 
he didn&#39;t really want to know how, all he ever wanted to be 
able to keep an eye on her. And to be thrust into a 
situation where she knew who he was completely baffled him. 
And Hiei dealt with things that confused him by a) killing 
them or b) pretending they didn&#39;t exist. Since he could 
never kill the one creature for which he felt life worth 
living that left pretending she (or at least the problem 
she had tossed in his lap) didn&#39;t exist. 

And so, after her efforts were unconsciously, yet viciously 
fought, Yukina finally let sympathetic Mukuro in on her 
plight. Mukuro, perfectly aware of what a stubborn idiot 
Hiei could be and having somewhat similar problems dealing 
with the little monster, had assured her that Hiei did 
adore, really, she had been into his mind and she knew. 

But knowing you were loved and being openly loved are two 
very different things, especially to Yukina. 

One thing had led to another, and here they were. Yukina, 
the adorable little doll of a girl and Mukuro, the firm but 
fair lord who had been a pretty doll in her youth. The idea 
not to tell Hiei had been gradual but mutually agreed on. 
He was in the dark, if only because it made Yukina feel 
better, since Mukuro didn&#39;t really care. 

Yukina sighed and leaned her head down on Mukuro&#39;s 
shoulder. Mukuro stroked her fluffy green hair soothingly. 
&quot;You know everything will work out, however it is going 
to.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Mukuro-sama,&quot; the ice maiden agreed. &quot;But wouldn&#39;t it 
be nice, just once, if things worked out the way I wanted 
them to? With Hiei-san and you and I, without 
complications? Maybe with secrets, because they&#39;re fun, but 
not lies?&quot; 

Mukuro was about to answer when suddenly a bright long beam 
of light invaded the dark room. After a brief second, the 
light disappeared with a banging sound-the door being 
slammed. Yukina bolted up, nervously smoothing out the 
wrinkles in her nightgown. 

Again, though, the opening door defeated the darkness, and 
a shocked, somewhat confused Hiei demanded, &quot;What on earth 
is going on here?&quot; 

Mukuro snickered to herself. Maybe Yukina would get her 
wish now.
