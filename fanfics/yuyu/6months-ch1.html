<h1>Six Months</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yuyu/index.html">Yu Yu Hakusho</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blackheart.html">Blackheart745</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	It was official. Yusuke Yuromeshi had somehow managed to defeat  
Rando in the Genkai tournament.  As a reward, Genkai would train him, 
and teach him the spirit wave.  In Botan&#146;s opinion, Yusuke should&#146;ve 
been thankful Genkai let him get away with as muchas he did.  He had 
only defeated Rando because the human hunter forgot that if no one 
hears the chant for the reduction technique, it will backfire and 
shrink the one who recited the chant in the first place.  

	Unfortunately, Kuwabara wasn&#146;t as lucky.  Though he discovered 
his spirit sword during the tournament, it didn&#146;t do much good against 
Rando.  Both his arms were broken, and so were his ribs.  Though 
Genkai managed to repair the broken bones, he&#146;d still have to go 
through the rehab.

	Luckily, there were six months of nothing but rest in relaxation 
for everyone.  Well, except Yusuke, who would be going through some 
extreme training, and Rando, who was thrown into the abyss.  

------------------------------------------------------------

	A month had gone by.  Kayko had been left in the dark all this 
time, and was totally unaware of where Yusuke was.  

	She was currently looking through her locker for her math book.  
However, her thoughts were elsewhere.

	&#147;It&#146;s been a whole month now, and no sign of Yusuke.&#148; Kayko said 
to herself.  &#147;&#148;Iwamoto must&#146;ve finally expelled him.  Or maybe he 
decided to drop out.&#148;

	&#147;Not exactly.&#148; A familiar voice replied.

	She turned her gaze away from the contents of her locker, and 
saw Botan standing there watching her.

	&#147;What do you want?&#148; She demanded.

	&#147;Well, I could tell you where Yusuke is, but&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Don&#146;t bother.  If it involves you, I&#146;m not interested.&#148;

	She started to walk off, but Botan reached out, grabbed her by 
the shoulder, and stopped her.

	&#147;I get the feeling you&#146;re mad at me for some reason.&#148; She said.  
&#147;If it&#146;s about Yusuke, I can guarantee you he&#146;s all yours.&#148;

	&#147;It isn&#146;t you.&#148; Kayko said with a sigh.  &#147;It&#146;s just that he&#146;s 
been skipping school like this all the time.  Even before you showed 
up, , he&#146;d skip.  Of course, he had a pattern.  He&#146;d attend every ten 
days, give or take depending on what kind of day he was having.  But 
he&#146;s been gone too long lately.  I get the feeling he finally dropped 
out.&#148;

	&#147;Oh, I&#146;m sorry to hear that.  I wish I could help, but&#133;&#148;

	At that moment, she saw an evil twinkle in Kayko&#146;s eyes.

	&#147;Actually,&#148; Kayko said, &#147;There was a movie I wanted to see, but 
I didn&#146;t want to go alone.  All my friends have other plans, and 
Kuwabara seems to have broken his ribs somehow.  Maybe&#133;  Just maybe, 
you&#146;d want to go?&#148;

	&#147;Oh sure.  A movie would be just delightful!&#148;

	Yeah, Kayko thought.  And the fun will only begin there.

------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;Come on Kuwabara!&#148; Okubo said, attempting to encourage his 
friend.  &#147;You can do it!&#148;

	&#147;EEG!  GNEE-AK!  Can&#146;t&#133;!  Do it!&#148; Kuwabara cried.

	&#147;You can lift it!  Just a little more!&#148;

	Kuwabara set the feather down; out of breath, and red in the 
face with exhaust.

	&#147;That was good, Kuwa man.&#148; Okubo said.  &#147;You actually lifted it 
higher than last time.&#148;

	&#147;THIS IS BULLSHIT!&#148; Kuwabara shouted.  &#147;I could kick some 
Kazanaga ass back in the day, but now I can&#146;t even lift a feather!&#148;

	&#147;Look, Kuwabara, rehab is no picnic.  I broke both my legs, and 
it took me eight months to walk without wobbling side to side.&#148;

	Kuwabara sighed, and grabbed the feather.

	&#147;That&#146;s right Kuwa man,&#148; Okubo said.  &#147;Lift like you&#146;ve never 
lifted before!  Show that feather who&#146;s the boss!&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	The next day, Kayko and Botan went to see the movie of choice.  
After a few hours, the movie ended, and the two walked back out of the 
theater with the other two people who actually stuck around for the 
ending.

	&#147;Good lord that movie sucked!&#148; Kayko commented.

	&#147;I know.&#148; Botan commented.  &#147;Absolutely no plot, and more 
inaccuracies than you could shake a stick at!&#148;

	Safe to say the two had given Star Trek Nemesis thumbs down.

	&#147;Well, the movie sucked, but it was still good to be with a 
friend.&#148; Kayko said.

	&#147;Oh, I&#146;m a friend now?&#148; Botan asked eagerly.

	Before anything further could happen, Kayko wrapped an arm 
around Botan, drew her close, and placed a kiss upon her cheek.  It 
was so quick, that a passer by could barely tell it happened if he or 
she gave enough of a damn to actually look, but it still surprised the 
hell out of Botan.

	&#147;Maybe if you play your cards right,&#148; Kayko said seductively, 
&#147;Maybe we could be&#133;  How you say, a little closer than that.&#148;

	With that, she walked off, leaving Botan to ponder what the hell 
just happened.

------------------------------------------------------------

	A week had gone by since the movie, and Botan was still 
confused.  Kayko was giving her strange glances, and she could&#146;ve 
sworn the brunette was up to something.   She just couldn&#146;t explain 
it.  What was Kayko trying to do.

	&#147;If I didn&#146;t know better,&#148; Botan thought, &#147;I&#146;d swear she were 
flurting with me.  That can&#146;t be it, she likes Yusuke in that manner.  
Maybe she&#146;s just really affectionate.  I just don&#146;t know.&#148;

	Just then, an idea came to mind!

	&#147;I got it!&#148; She said out loud, startling the hell out of a 
passer by.  &#147;I don&#146;t know, but I know someone who might!&#148;

	She ran aimlessly into the wilderness, hoping to find whatever 
she was looking for.

------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;Okay Kuwa man,&#148; Okubo said.  &#147;You lifted that feather like it 
were&#133;  Uh&#133;  A feather!  Now lift this one just like it!&#148;

	&#147;I&#133; CAN&#146;T&#133;  DO IT!   AAAAAH&#148;

	Kuwabara set down the empty soda can, and tried to catch his 
breath.

	&#147;Man,&#148; Kuwabara commented.  &#147;Maybe I should&#146;ve stuck with the 
feather for another week or so.&#148;

	&#147;Don&#146;t say that!&#148; Okubo protested.  &#147;You can do it!  That can&#146;s 
nothing but a little chicken shit compared to the mighty Kuwabara.  
YOU CAN DO IT!&#148;

	After Kuwabara got his breath, he lifted the empty soda can once 
again.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Botan had arrived in Spirit world.  Though it took all afternoon 
to get there, and would take her all night to get back to the living 
realm, she hoped she could get the advice she was looking for.

	She walked in on Koenma, who had stamped a sheet of paper with 
his seal of approval.

	&#147;There.&#148; He said, catching his breath.  &#147;That&#146;s the last one.&#148;

	&#147;Koenma sir?&#148; Botan asked.

	&#147;Oh, hey Botan.  What brings you here?&#148;

	&#147;Well, it&#146;s kind of a unique situation really.&#148;

	&#147;Oh god, don&#146;t tell me another demon&#146;s on the loose.&#148;

	&#147;No.  I have a little&#133;  Uh, personal problem, and&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;ve been watching your little situation with 
Kayko.&#148;

	&#147;You have?&#148;

	&#147;Well yeah, dad&#146;s off getting drunk with his friends, and I&#146;m 
supposed to monitor the spirit detective, and his assistant.  That, of 
course, being you.  So far, you haven&#146;t blown your cover.  I&#146;m proud.  
Makes me glad&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Look, can you help me out or not.&#148;

	&#147;Well, you&#146;re going to be on Earth for quite a while.  Might as 
well enjoy yourself.  Your job doesn&#146;t necessarily have to be all work 
and no play.&#148;

	&#147;WHAT?!  I can&#146;t believe you!  Sure, I appear to be the same age 
she is, but I&#146;m thousands of years older than her!&#148;

	&#147;And I may appear to be only two, but I&#146;ve been around much much 
longer than you have!  Look, love is strange that way.  Some people 
find it in the opposite sex, some find it in the same sex.  Some find 
it in the opposite sex in a man or woman twenty years older than they 
are!  That&#146;s just how life works.&#148;

	Botan didn&#146;t bother giving him a response.  &#147;Now run along.&#148; 
Koenma said.  &#147;I got a pay per view coming on in ten minutes.&#148;
	
------------------------------------------------------------

	The location was the City of Ghosts and Apparitions.  In the 
center of this city sat a mighty fortress known as Maze Castle.  And 
inside that castle, on the top floor of the highest tower, there lived 
the four saint beasts: Genbu, Byakko, Seiryu, and Suzaku.

	Suzaku sat there, watching what appeared to be part five of the 
Friday the Thirteenth movie series.  Just as Jason killed another 
helpless victom, Seiryu had walked in, and interrupted Suzaku&#146;s movie.

	&#147;Lord Suzaku,&#148; He said, &#147;I have&#133;&#148;

	He froze once he saw the irritated look on Suzaku&#146;s face.  
However, the yellow haired humanoid managed to remain calm as ever as 
he spoke.

	&#147;A comfortable chair, some pop corn and a soda, and one of my 
personal favorite movies ever made by a human.&#148; He said.  &#147;Which isn&#146;t 
saying much, but still, I treasure moments like these.  So you better 
have a good reason for spoiling the mood.&#148;

	&#147;A thousand apologies, lord Suzaku.&#148; Seiryu said.  &#147;I just came 
to give you the report.  We have gathered enough Makai insects for the 
invasion of the living world.&#148;

	&#147;Very good.  Have Byakko make sure the gateway of betrayal 
works.  You never know when someone will decide to pay us a little 
visit.&#148;

	&#147;Yes my lord.&#148;

	With that, Seiryu left.  Suzaku returned to his movie, and 
laughed with delight as another helpless camper was slaughtered.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Four more months, and Yusuke would return home from training.  
However, there would be more than enough for his friends to do in 
order to take their minds off of him.  For one, his mom would drink 
herself into oblivion night in and night out.  Kuwabara was still 
going through some serious rehab, and would officially lift an empty 
laundry hamper, though it took all his might to do so.  

	And then there was Botan.  Her visit to the spirit world was 
obviously in vain.  Therefore, she would just have to wait for Kayko&#146;s 
next move.

	&#147;Some help  he was.&#148; Botan said to herself.  &#147;You&#146;d think for 
someone who&#146;s examined human behavior for this long, he&#146;d know what 
type of situation this is.  I have a bad feeling about&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Hey Botan.&#148; Kayko greeted.

	Botan nearly jumped out of her skin in absolute shock, only to 
see that it was just Kayko.

	&#147;DON&#146;T DO THAT!&#148; She exclaimed.  

	&#147;Sorry.&#148; Kayko said.  &#147;I was just wondering&#133;  If it isn&#146;t too 
much trouble, you could come over to my house.  You know, just to hang 
out.&#148;

	&#147;Uh&#133;  Well, sure, why not?&#148; Botan said.  &#147;After all, what are 
friends for?&#148;

	&#147;Great!&#148;

	With that, she gave Botan a quick hug, and went off to her next 
class; thinking her sinister thoughts all the way.

	That&#146;s right Botan, Kayko thought.  Wander right into my little 
trap.  God bless business trips.  Mom and dad won&#146;t be home till 
tomorrow morning.  Which means Botan&#146;s all mine for the night.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Kayko sat there on the sofa; waiting for Botan, and starting to 
grow impatient.  So impatient, she decided to raid her father&#146;s porno 
stash, find a video entitled &#147;Cunt-tacular 2,997&#148;, and pleasured 
herself like she imagined she would pleasure Botan.  Safe to say the 
sofa now had quite the stain on it, but Kayko had no interest in that.

	Finally, Botan showed up.

	&#147;Sorry I&#146;m late.&#148; She said.  

	&#147;You showed up, and that&#146;s all I was hoping for.&#148; Kayko replied 
with a devious smile.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Up in spirit world, Koenma watched as Kayko and Botan had begun 
to talk, and basically do nothing.

	&#147;This is always the boring part.&#148; Koenma said.  &#147;COME ON!  
Somebody&#133;  Whoa, hello!&#148;

	He watched in awe as Kayko had placed her lips on Botan&#146;s in a 
passionate kiss.  However, Botan seemed a little freaked out.

	&#147;They always freak the first time.&#148; Koenma remarked.

------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!&#148; Botan demanded.  &#147;I thought you and I 
were just friends, and the next thing I know, you&#146;re jamming your 
tongue down my throat.  I mean, I could&#146;ve sworn Yusuke was your 
boyfriend.&#148;

	&#147;I thought the same thing too.&#148; Kayko commented.  &#147;But then he 
disappeared, and I haven&#146;t heard from him sense.  I&#146;d think after he 
came back from the dead, he&#146;d be a little more grateful that he has 
friends!  It just doesn&#146;t&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Oh I&#146;m sure Yusuke&#146;s just off camping or something.  But that&#146;s 
not the point.  Yusuke&#146;s gone, and suddenly you&#146;re flurting with me, 
giving me those sinister looks; not to mention what just happened 
right now.&#148;

	&#147;Look.  I was interested in Yusuke as a friend.  Nothing more, 
nothing less.  However, I&#146;ve seen you, and at first I thought you and 
Yusuke were&#133;  You know, like that.  But now I see you and Yusuke were 
just friends, I found I kind of like you.&#148;

	She ran her fingertips down Botan&#146;s face: slowly, and yet 
methodically.  &#147;Maybe even love you.&#148; She added.  &#147;Look, I&#146;m going to 
be upstairs.  If you&#146;re still interested, meet me up there.  
Otherwise, feel free to leave.&#148;

	With that, she walked up stairs.

	&#147;Fool.&#148; She thought.  &#147;You&#146;re falling for every single word.  
Hook, line, and sinker.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;Sheesh, I hate it when porno tries to look like an emotional 
love story.&#148; Koenma said with a sigh.  &#147;SOMEONE FUCK SOMEBODY 
ALREADY!.&#148;

	He watched as Botan sat on the sofa; thinking of whether she 
should, or shouldn&#146;t meet up with Kayko upstairs.   After a while, it 
appeared she finally made her decision.  And much to Koenma&#146;s delight, 
it wasn&#146;t to leave.

	&#147;All right!&#148; He exclaimed.  &#147;HLA!  HLA!&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	Botan went upstairs, and looked in Kayko&#146;s room.  There she was; 
lying on the bed, and waiting for her.  And apparently, she was all 
ready to go.

	&#147;I&#146;ve been waiting.&#148; Kayko said.

	Botan didn&#146;t reply.  She simply stood there, and watched as 
Kayko stood up, and methodically made her way to Botan.

	&#147;Okay, you have me.&#148; Botan said.  &#147;Now what?&#148;

	Next thing she knew, she could feel Kayko attempting to lift her 
shirt over her head.  Botan merely lifted her arms over her head; 
allowing the other woman to successfully de-shirt her. 

	&#147;No bra, eh?&#148; Kayko said,  placing a fingertip on Botan&#146;s 
nipple.  She shivered both with extremely slight pleasure, and with 
the fact Kayko&#146;s hand was ice cold.  &#147;I don&#146;t know how you kept Yusuke 
away from you, but it must&#146;ve worked.  Now it&#146;s my turn.&#148;

	She turned her back to Botan, and lifted her arms over her head.  
It didn&#146;t take very long for Botan to get the idea.  She lifted Kako&#146;s 
shirt over her head, and tossed it aside on top of her own disguarded 
article of clothing.

	&#147;You don&#146;t have a bra either.&#148; Botan commented, tweeking Kayko&#146;s 
nipple.  She seemed to have a satisfied reaction, but her facial 
expression looked more shocked as Botan continued to please her.  

	&#147;W-w-w-what are y-you&#133;?&#148; She started, but Botan put a hand over 
her mouth.

	&#147;You wanted me, you got me.  However, we&#146;re playing by my 
rules.&#148;

	Okay, Kayko thought.  This wasn&#146;t what I had in mind.  What do I 
do now?

	&#147;I know what you&#146;re probably thinking.  What do I do now?  Well, 
you just finish stripping, let me slip out of something a little more 
comfortable, and the fun will truly begin.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	Koenma sat there; watching as Botan dropped her jeans, and 
revealed her lack of panties.  However, Kayko had revealed she was 
wearing a fong under that skirt.  Of course, Koenma could care less, 
seeing as how he was resisting the urge to jack off, and failing with 
flying colors.

	&#147;KOENMA!&#148; A voice shouted from behind.

	The miniature ruler of the spirit world nearly jumped out of his 
skin, and literally jumped out of his chair!  After landing on his 
feet a foot away from the chair, he looked behind him, and saw the 
hulking figure of King Yamma behind him!

	&#147;Uh&#133;.  Dad.&#148; Koenma said, trying not to look surprised.

	&#147;Son, what have I told you about pornography?&#148;

	&#147;To invite a couple friends over, and jack off to our heart&#146;s 
content?&#148;

	&#147;EXACTLY!  Porno&#146;s that much better when you have company.  So 
where&#146;s everyone else?&#148;

	&#147;Uh&#133;  Well, they all claimed to have more important issues.&#148;

	&#147;Figures.  Well, I hate to see a porno go to waste, so I&#146;ll 
watch it with you.&#148;

	&#147;Oh all right.&#148;

	With that, King Yamma pulled up a chair, and sat next to his son 
as the two women began making out.

	&#147;Ah yes, lesbian porn.&#148; Yamma said.  &#147;The best kind of porn 
there is.  None of that girl sandwich crap you and that blue guy were 
watching last time.  I don&#146;t care what you say.  Girl between the two 
of them or no girl between the two of them, those two were 
FUH-LAMING!&#148;

	&#147;Uh, dad, you&#146;re missing the HLA.&#148;

	&#147;Oh, sorry.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	Kayko lie back on her back while Botan mounted herself atop the 
lovely brunette: kissing, tickling, and teasing her to both their 
hearts&#146; content.  Though fairly new to the concept of lesbianism, 
Botan seemed to know exactly what turned the girl below her on, what 
spots got the most satisfied reaction, and so forth.  And then came 
the big moment.  

	Botan let her fingertips trail down Kayko&#146;s belly, past her 
waistline, and onto her pubic hair.  Kayko instinctly spread her legs, 
and wasn&#146;t disappointed in the least.  For Botan inserted a finger 
into her.  Slowly, yet carefully, she rubbed the insides of the other 
woman, and smiled at the satisfied moans she received.  However, she 
stopped massaging her inner cunt when she found  her knub.  She then 
inserted a second finger in exchange for her previous digit, and began 
to rub her clit like crazy.  Kayko&#146;s moans became louder and louder 
until she did the one thing you never want to do during sex (straight, 
gay, or lesbian alike).

	&#147;Oh!  OH YUSUKE!&#148; She screamed.

	Botan instantly froze, slowly withdrew her soaked finger from 
Kayko&#146;s slit, and gave her an ice cold glare.

	&#147;Yusuke?&#148; She demanded.  &#147;I go along with your little game, I 
let you kiss me, I let you touch me, and I fuck you to your heart&#146;s 
content, and that&#146;s all I get?  AN orgasm that isn&#146;t intended for 
me?!&#148;

	&#147;Botan, wait!&#148;

	Botan got off Kayko, and started for the heep of clothing.  
Despite Kayko&#146;s protests, she searched through the heap, found the 
clothing shewas originally wearing, and slipped it on.

	&#147;I didn&#146;t mind the movies, I didn&#146;t mind the kisses, and I even 
put up with fucking you!&#148; Botan shouted.  &#147;But if you&#146;re just going to 
use me as a substitute for Yusuke, then I bid thee good night!&#148;

	&#147;Botan it&#146;s&#133;&#148;

	Before she could say anything further, the door slammed shut, 
and the sounds of Botan leaving were all Kayko could hear from there.  

------------------------------------------------------------

	&#147;God, I hate it when porno ends like that.&#148; Yamma commented.  
&#147;Keeps you in suspense, but disappoints you completely.&#148;

	King Yamma stood up and stretched as Koenma continued to watch 
silently.

	&#147;Well, it was still good watching a porno with my son.&#148; He said.  
&#147;We should do it again some time.&#148;

	&#147;Sure thing, dad.&#148; Koenma replied.  &#147;Just don&#146;t forget the beer 
next time.&#148;

	&#147;Don&#146;t worry. King Yamma&#146;s not a neglectful father.  I&#146;ll get 
you plenty of beer nex ttime.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	The next morning, Kayko woke up, and came down stairs.  However 
she ended up in a face to face encounter with her father.

	&#147;Kayko?&#148; He asked.  &#147;Were you watching my porn?&#148;

	&#147;Yes sir.&#148; She said with a sigh.

	&#147;What have I told you about watching daddy&#146;s porn?&#148;

	&#147;That if I ever decide to watch it, I should never finger myself 
on the sofa.&#148;

	&#147;Exactly!  That damn sofa cost me five thousand yen.  Do you 
know how hard it is earning yen at a five yen per hour job?  I don&#146;t 
know why I even bother sometimes.  I swear&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Dad, you&#146;re ranting again.&#148;

	&#147;Huh?  Oh, sorry dear.  Look, we can clean up the mess, just 
don&#146;t do it again, okay?&#148;

	&#147;Yes sir.&#148;

	And with that, The normal everyday life of Kayko Yukimora 
continued.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Frankly, neither Kayko or Kuwabara were looking forward to 
school.  For Kayko, there were many reasons.  Encountering Botan a day 
after her mistake during the greatest moment of her life being the 
main reason.  She had her doubts that Botan would even want to talk to 
her.  

	Kuwabara&#146;s reason was that in spite of his rehab, he could 
barely lift his book bag.  Needless to say he wasn&#146;t looking forward 
to any future fights.

	Kayko would have to face her sooner or later.  She was hoping 
for later, but apparently, fate didn&#146;t deal that card.  For Botan had 
bumped into her on her way to math class.

	&#147;Oh, hey.&#148; Botan greeted.

	&#147;Hey.&#148; Kayko greeted.  A moment of dead silence had passed by at 
first, then finally, it was broken.  &#147;Listen, Botan, I just wanted to 
say&#133;&#148;

	&#147;You&#146;re sorry?  Oh don&#146;t worry about it.&#148;

	&#147;Huh?&#148;

	&#147;Well you know.  Yusuke&#146;s been gone for quite a while now, and I 
had a feeling you&#146;re still getting over the loss.&#148;

	&#147;Yeah,&#148; Kayko sighed.  &#147;That&#146;s exactly what&#146;s going on.  But 
don&#146;t worry.&#148;  She gave Botan the trademark look that always meant she 
had some sort of evil plan.,  &#147;I think I found someone else.&#148;

	&#147;Wait, are you saying&#133;?&#148;

	She froze, realizing Kayko had taken her hand in hers, and was 
letting their fingers intertwine in one another.  

	&#147;Yes,&#148; she said, &#147;I do.&#148;

	At first, nothing happened.  Then, Botan finally broke the 
awkward freeze-frame-esk predicament by giving her a hug.  Kayko 
returned the embrace; losing herself in the warmth and loving 
gentleness of Botan&#146;s arms.

	&#147;I do too.&#148; Botan said.	

------------------------------------------------------------

	Another month had gone by.  In the city of Ghosts and 
Apparitions, the four saint beasts were in a conference.

	&#147;The makai insects are all gathered.&#148; Seiryu explained.  &#147;We&#146;ll 
send a couple of spies from the city to try and find a crack in the 
barrier.&#148;

	&#147;The gate of betrayal works just fine.&#148; Byakko said.  &#147;Oi, I 
won&#146;t be feeling my arms anytime soon.&#148;

	&#147;And no one from spirit world suspects a thing.&#148; Suzaku laughed.

	&#147;Yes,&#148; Genbu commented.  &#147;That fool Koenma&#146;s probably been 
watching lesbian pornography all the live long day.&#148;

	&#147;And the best part is no one suspects a thing.&#148; Suzaku added.  
&#147;However, it wouldn&#146;t surprise me a bit if those idiots in spirit 
world send their spirit detectives out here after the invasion is 
apparent.  I would inform the fugaki to expect a meal in the future.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	It was about eleven in the evening.  Kayko&#146;s mom and dad were 
off yet again, and she had invited Botan to her house.  However, 
unlike last time, they decided not to get X-rated in their second 
attempt.  The most they did that night was cuddle; losing themselves 
in the warmth and tenderness of the other&#146;s embrace.

	As they did so, Botan&#146;s mind was elsewhere: sort of in an area 
between bliss and deep thought.

	Strange, Botan thought.  I love her like no other, but I can&#146;t 
help but feel guilty.  If I know Yusuke, he&#146;s so going to be pissed 
when he finds out Kayko dumped him for me.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Another month had past, and the city of Ghosts and Apparitions 
was becoming more and more of a threat.  

	Byakko had made his way to Suzaku&#146;s quarters, and caught him in 
the middle of Child&#146;s Play: the Bride of Chucky.

	&#147;Lord Suzaku.&#148; He said.

	Suzaku hit pause on his video, and gave Byakko an aggravated 
glare.

	&#147;This better be worth it.&#148; Suzaku said, hiding his frustration.  
&#147;It&#146;s my favorite scene in the movie, and I do so hate to be 
interrupted.&#148;

	&#147;Terribly sorry sir.  I&#146;ve just come to inform you that 
operation get Spirit world to let us into the living world so we can 
take over is under way.&#148;

	&#147;Really should&#146;ve thought of a better operation name.&#148;

	&#147;Don&#146;t look at me, sir: Genbu named it.&#148;

	&#147;Yes yes, I know.  Has the threatening letter that gives away 
our plan days before it can go into effect been sent?&#148;

	&#147;Yes sir.&#148;

	&#147;Good.  That&#146;ll be all.  Now leave.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

	Only two more days, and Yusuke would return.  However, Botan had 
more important matters to tend to.  Kayko, unfortunately, wasn&#146;t one 
of them.  She had gotten word that a demon had appeared on Earth, and 
was reeking havoc.

	Great, Botan thought.  Just great.  The one chance I get to be 
with Kayko, and I have to fill in for Yusuke while he&#146;s getting his 
training.  Man, I hope this isn&#146;t a class A demon.  

	Just then, she spotted something!  It looked like a human, but 
it was a dark green color, and looked as if it were the result of a 
nuclear experiment gone horribly wrong.  And in his skinny little 
hands was a box that seemed to be spuing out a swarm of flies.

	&#147;Hey!&#148; Botan shouted.  &#147;What do you think you&#146;re doing?&#148;

	The creature made a noise as if to say &#147;Uh Oh&#148;, and made a run 
for it.  Botan chased after him, but at the same time pondered the 
mystery of the bugs that came from the box he dropped.

	Those flies, she thought.  Were those makai insects?  There&#146;s 
only one place with Makai insects.

------------------------------------------------------------

	Meanwhile, in the spirit world, Koenma was filling out some 
paper work.

	&#147;Repeal, sure.&#148; He said, stamping the piece of paper, and 
quickly moving onto the next paper with intense speed.  &#147;Repeal, sure.  
Repeal sure.  Go to hell, fine.  Repeal, sure.  Come back from the 
dead, fine with me.  Repeal&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Sir?&#148; a voice called.

	Koenma looked up from his stack of papers, and saw one of the 
many ogres that wandered around.  

	&#147;What?!&#148; He demanded.  &#147;Can&#146;t you see I&#146;m busy?!&#148;

	&#147;Sir, we got a message.&#148;

	He handed Koenma a note in a dark yellowish gray envelope.  
Koenma opened it, read it, and freaked out!

	&#147;Sir?&#148; the ogre asked.

	&#147;It&#146;s from the four saint beasts.&#148; Koenma explained.  &#147;They want 
legal immigration into the living world.&#148;

	&#147;What do we do?&#148;

	&#147;I don&#146;t know!  Yusuke&#146;s got a day or two before he gets back 
from Genkai&#146;s, and Botan&#146;s no spirit detective!  Dad&#146;s so going to 
kill me.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

(Will Botan catch the demon?  Were those makai insects inside his box?  
Will Yusuke ever come back?  What will Kayko do when Yusuke gets back?  
Will the four saint beasts (Suzaku, Seiryu, Byakko, and Genbu) get 
legal immigration into the living world?  What would they do if they 
HAD legal immigration?  AND HOW THE HELL DID KUWABARA DROP OUT OF THE 
STORY?!  All this and more in the actual series.  SO START WATCHING!  
I&#146;m too lazy to go any further than this.  So use your sick little 
imagination.)
