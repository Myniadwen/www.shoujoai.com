<a href="../angelsanct/demonhart-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>	The night slowly enclosed the two demons, as Belial landed swiftly 
into her place, holding the precious princess in her arms. She lay her 
down gently on the bed.

&quot;You should rest, now, my princess, for you have suffered much in the 
last few hours.&quot; she said, a tender smile on her pale face.

Kurai took an instant to gather her spirits. She was back in the Mad 
Hatter&#39;s palace, exhausted after all this turmoil. She let her head rest 
onto the soft pillows beneath her, as the jester sat down by her side, 
gazing at her just like she had seen Alexiel&#39;s eyes craving for 
Gabrielle earlier.

Though she struggled to say something, the warming feeling of sleep 
gaining power over her, she could do nothing more than close her eyes 
and let her mind drift away into the night. The last she felt, she 
thought, was someone laying a gentle kiss on her forehead. Nothing more.


*


	Kurai awakened to the morning light filtering through the thick 
crimson curtains. The room seemed so much friendlier bathed in this 
gentle red light, the fresh scent of lavender helping her recovered her 
spirits. As she turned her head to the warmth beside her, the young 
princess saw the jester that had brought her to this place, laying 
asleep, fully dressed, on top of the covers by her side. She looked as 
though she had fallen asleep watching over her that night. 


	Kurai smiled with all her heart and moved closer to Belial, close 
enough to feel her heartbeat and let herself drown in the perfume she 
found so familiar. 

The jester slowly opened her eyes.

&quot;Awake already, my princess?&quot; she whispered.

Kurai answered nothing, but wrapped her small arms around the demon and 
buried her face in the pale neck and wavy orange hair until she felt her 
loved one close her own arms on her in a gentle embrace.

As they grew closer and closer, for the first time, she thought, the 
young princess could feel her body calling out to the demon&#39;s, as an 
eager child that could not wait to open a beautiful present.

She wondered if this was the way the trickster felt when she approached 
women, when she approached her...

&quot;You should not call me &#39;princess&#39; anymore.&quot; Kurai whispered ever 
softly, her lips slightly brushing against Belial&#39;s earlobe, her eyes 
lost in the curly locks.

&quot;Then what shall I call you?&quot; the jester answered, shifting her body as 
though she could feel and anticipate the young one&#39;s desires.

&quot;You may call me your &#39;queen&#39;...&quot; the princess replied, teasing the 
reddish curls with one finger, her head moving backwards to meet the 
amused glance of the demon.

	The androgynous being began shifting her own body on top, and 
slowly pulled the sheets off the silver-haired princess, revealing her 
tender youthful body, covered only in a thin pearl-colored satin 
nightgown. A carnival of lace, beads and small buttons closed the 
garment on her bosom, revealing only, under the thin fabric, those two 
rosebuds that could drive the demon insane, as they slowly rose in 
harmony with the heartbeats in her chest. 

Before the trickster could make a move toward such a treasure, the 
novice&#39;s hand made her way past the bowtie on the neck and into the 
demon&#39;s shirt and began to undo the buttons that held it together, one 
after another, taking time to track her long fingernails down the bare 
skin that revealed pale as the painted face upon her, until she reached 
the slacks, held by an elegantly ornate belt. 

A pale hand came down to help the unexperinced fingers open the last 
lock and free the waist from this distracting object.

	As she reached to pull off the now wide open shirt, the virgin&#39;s 
hands were guided instead to a spot underneath the fabric, where were 
kept two secrets she had wondered about often. Two small breasts, firm 
as a man&#39;s chest would be, yet soft to the touch like an unrequited 
oasis on such an extraordinary body. She clasped her fingers on two 
mounds that stiffened with envy, as she rose her head to greet them with 
a maidenly kiss.

The demon&#39;s back arched like a feline under the gentle touch, and she 
let her own claws at the maiden&#39;s back, tearing off, in a compulsive 
motion, the back of the so fragile nightgown, then making their way 
gently to the base of her backbone. The young princess sat up in 
anticipation as the claws went deeper and deeper under the robe, her 
skin shivering under the excruciatingly slow progression.

&quot;My Queen...&quot; the deep voice whispered, as the lips felt their way up 
the trembling neck to the craving mouth awaiting them, the hands 
following the upward motion. Kurai let herself sink into a deep, 
passionate kiss, thrusting her head forward to press against the lips 
that kept teasing hers, while she willingly let her torn nightgown slide 
off her shoulders and fall to her waist. 

	Her hands then went for the demon&#39;s shirt, but were stopped in 
their course by a firm hand and guided to the slacks, where they freed 
the legs of their garment, revealing nothing more than a pair of elegant 
black lace pantyhose, one of the Hatter&#39;s fetish, the novice thought, 
amused. 

The jester let the shirt slide off her broad yet thin shoulders, 
grinning to the princess&#39; surprise, as she kept the bowtie around her 
neck in a strange combination of masculine and feminine attributes. 
Kurai felt her chest hardening and a strange feeling birth inside her 
body at the sight of the androgyn&#39;s base, yet another place of wonder 
for her youthful mind.

	&quot;Do you like what you see, my Queen?&quot; the trickster purred, as she 
went for the rosebuds she had been so eager to pick, tasting the elegant 
flavor of youth on the shivering tan skin. The maiden pulled the feline 
down onto her own body, craving for the source of her curiosity, while 
the creature tasted every inch of skin that was left bare on her chest, 
slowly moving down to the Eden of her desire.

	&quot;Wait, let me...&quot; the princess moaned, reaching out for the 
demon&#39;s hips as she wanted to satisfy her curiosity above anything else.

&quot;Ladies always come before the jester, my Queen...&quot; the red-haired 
muttered as she made her way into the virgin&#39;s gorgeous sanctuary, 
already flowing abundantly with passion. The maiden arched her back in 
agony, waiting as the experienced lover teased her with her soft warm 
breath, amused at the young one&#39;s eagerness, her arms firmly holding the 
now angry legs apart, not allowing them the slightest move of relief. 
The princess held her breathing and grasped the satin sheets beneath her 
tightly, as the venimous serpent found it&#39;s way to the fully ripe fruit 
of her deliverance and captured the treasure into it&#39;s world, releasing 
the maiden&#39;s voiceless cry she had so craved for as she gave into her 
own temptation in a passionately calculated move. 

	The silver-haired, breathless after the climax she had reluctanly 
given into, stretched out her hands to grasp the demon&#39;s head as the 
creature lingered in the sacred garden, treating her experienced tongue 
with every flavor the beautiful rose had to offer. She finally let go of 
the legs she had kept prisonner, and mover her lips back to where they 
belonged, pressing the dragon princess&#39; own with the delightful aroma of 
her love, craving to move deeper into her queen&#39;s realm. But the maiden 
broke the kiss.

&quot;More?&quot; the demon grinned viciously, ready to treat her queen as many 
more times as she would desire.

&quot;Please... let me...&quot; the maiden pleaded once again.

&quot;Do as you please, my Queen.&quot; the jester smiled as she rolled onto her 
back and let the novice move on top and explore the shapes she was so 
eager to discover. 

	The princess freed her legs from the remainder of her garment, and 
went for the unknown kingdom she wondered about, her own Eden mocking 
the lustful eyes and tongue that had been teasing her only a moment ago.

&quot;Touch me and you&#39;ll never get another taste of it...&quot; the princess 
warned maliciously, now ready for a little mischief.

The androgynous creature grinned, welcoming the game. 

	The mysterious realm, she found to be similar to her own, 
enchanting in it&#39;s peculiar way, and she began to wish she were the 
first to ever lay claim on it&#39;s lands, though she knew this could not be 
the case. With one hand, she parted the thin legs waiting for her, while 
she made sure the other stroke every inch of her skin the demon had not 
yet tasted, as to make the trickster know the agony she had just been 
put through.

The jester put one hand to her mouth, the other firmly grasping the 
sheets beneath, and bit her knuckles in craving, as the maiden&#39;s 
insolent breath and tongue worked together in slowly exploring every 
inch the heretic sanctuary had to offer, yet neglecting the pulsing 
flower that so needed the virgin gardener&#39;s delicate touch to reach full 
bloom. She finally made her way to the entrance she resolved to 
investigate, as the sweet scent of the nectar it released kept calling 
for her.

	The jester moaned with envy and despair, as the princess kept 
torturing her sensitiveness. The maiden, aware of the effect she was 
producing, let go of her free hand and slid her arm under the demon&#39;s 
trembling legs, replacing her adventurous tongue with two long yet 
delicate fingers, as she moved closer to the hidden pearl she had 
purposely been neglecting.

&quot;Queen...&quot; the demon moaned, begging for the young woman to go through 
with her passion, though, she felt, she had never enjoyed anticipation 
so much before. The maiden removed before the jester could express her 
longing, and heard the creature whine gently in anger. She shifted her 
body as to face the androgyn&#39;s fiery gaze, and suddenly grasped the 
precious jewel she had been offered, while melting her lips onto the 
moaning lips that welcomed her once again. The demon let out a long, 
high-piched but quiet shriek, as Kurai felt the passion bolt running 
through the delighted body, whose arms wrapped intensely around the 
young one and held her tightly in embrace for yet a few minutes. 

	They broke the kiss, the maiden satisfied with the look of relief 
she could see in the androgynous creature&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I love you...&quot; she whispered to the jester, smiling gratefully.

&quot;My Queen...&quot; the demon&#39;s eyes shied away, her cheeks growing red, as 
though, lustful as she had been in the past, it were the first time she 
had ever been told such a thing.

Kurai, understanding the feeling, reached out for her lover&#39;s hand and 
let their fingers entertwine quietly as she gently lay her head onto the 
pale chest. This was the feeling, she thought, she had wanted to bring 
upon the demon, upon herself. This was the feeling of love she had so 
longed for...


&quot;Belial...&quot;

&quot;hm?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not leaving this time, are you? I think... we still need each 
other much more...&quot;

&quot;...whatever pleases my Queen...&quot;
