<pre>The Cogs of Fate Begin to Turn

	A chilling wind blew through the old, rock-crafted temple.  It hit 
Ledge hard, chilling her to the bone.  It was times like this that the 
lime haired, auburn-eyed young woman wished she&#39;d worn more.  But she 
only wore a tight fitting navy blue tunic and tight black short shorts 
that were hidden under it.  To keep the tunic close she wore a brown 
leather belt that had a golden buckle.  On the left side of the belt 
rested a gun holster that held an odd shaped knife.  Rather then having 
a straight hilt its&#39; grip was curved.  On the other side of the belt 
rested yet another sheath that held a regular dagger. 

	Ledge wrapped her arms around the young woman who stood next to 
her, and then clung her violet-gloved hands together so as to get a firm 
grip.  &quot;How much longer, Mistress?&quot; she asked Flea; the female magician 
she currently had a loving death grip on.  

	Flea was a decent looking woman, to say the least. Her long pink 
hair was kept in a high braid that hung to her mid-back. She wore a 
loose white cloak that flowed over her body and had a red stripe at the 
bottom. Under the cloak she wore a tight white vest that clung to her 
body.  Brown stockings covered her legs and over that was a crimson 
colored skirt.   &quot;Not much longer, love.&quot;  Flea slipped her hand around 
Ledge&#39;s shoulder and kissed the twenty-one year old on the cheek 
affectionately.  

	Ledge had no idea where she was, or even where she was going.  All 
she really knew was she was with Flea, and that was far more then enough 
reason to go.  And until she knew she&#39;d just wrap her slender, chilled 
arms around Flea, and accept the magician&#39;s cloak for warmth.  The duo 
walked in the dark for ten minutes or so. As they made their way through 
the dusty tunnel they cuddled and kissed.  They stopped when they hit 
the final room.  &quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Flea announced as she gripped the 
shivering girl tightly.

	They were at the mouth of a large, circular room. Most of the room 
was bottomless, but setting on the walls were large, dog-human statues 
that held violet sphere&#39;s that gave off an eerie light.  A walkway led 
to a to old, cracked stairs.  In the center of the room was a pedestal 
that was elevated ten feet from the ground.  On the pedestal stood a 
tall, cloaked figure.  

	The figure turned, his cape swirling about him.  &quot;Now!&quot; the man 
said in a deep, sinister tone.  &quot;This is it!  The point of no return!&quot; 
he preached.  The darkened figure then pointed at Ledge and screamed, 
&quot;Now, open the final door! The door to the key!&quot;

	Ledge cowered slightly at the imposing figure, but Flea gave her 
an encouraging smile and a wink, then shoved her forward. Ledge 
reluctantly climbed the stairs to the very top of the pedestal, and 
stopped near the cloaked man.  He motioned her towards the center of the 
platform and she moved.  

	The man grinned maniacally, and then waved his hands around like a 
lunatic.  &quot;Now! Open the door of time!&quot;  

	Ledge glanced at Flea, who nodded.  With very much-needed 
emotional support from her mistress, she closed her eyes and focused.  A 
warm wind enveloped her body, which was beginning to tingle. Very slowly 
she began to levitate, and then she instinctively chanted. 

	&quot;Wake up, Sleepy head!&quot; an echoing voice called, interrupting her 
chant.  The voice was soft, and very, very sweet, like the voice of a 
young woman who could only be described as &#39;just too cute&#39;. Ledge 
lowered to the ground, and her feet touched stone unsteadily, much to 
the disappointment of the cloaked figure. &quot;C&#39;mon, Ledge! Wake up!&quot; the 
voice shouted firmly. 

	&quot;Alundra?&quot; Ledge said sluggishly as she stifled a yawn or two.  
She was having the oddest dream when her young friend came along.  Ledge 
rubbed her eyes softly and blinked a few times as her vision focused on 
the woman in front of her. 

	Alundra was seventeen, and very short.  The petite girl had short 
spiked brown hair and yellow cat-like eyes.  She wore a tight purple 
vest that would&#39;ve shown off her bust, if she had one. Under the vest 
she wore a thin, almost transparent sweater, and sky blue suspenders 
held up her loose gray pants.

	Alundra gave Ledge her cutest smile, &quot;It&#39;s &#39;bout time to go, eh?&quot; 
she asked, knowing the answer.  They were late to the ferry that&#39;d take 
them to Truce, and if they missed it they&#39;d be stuck in Medina for 
another three weeks.  And that was the last thing Alundra wanted.  She&#39;d 
been waiting her whole life to leave, and now that she was old enough 
she was going to.  

	Ledge yawned before setting up in her chair and stretching.  Her 
eyes, as they always did when she first woke, looked fatigued.  And, as 
always it was Alundra&#39;s fault that she had to wake.  Standing she 
grabbed her bag and slung it over her shoulder, &quot;Okay, lets go!&quot; The 
elder girl began to march off, but then came to a sudden halt.  &quot;Wait a 
minute,&quot; she said thoughtfully, much to the despair of her young friend, 
&quot;Do your parent&#39;s know you&#39;re going?&quot;

	&quot;Ah, no&quot; Alundra mumbled in response.  Maybe if she spoke quietly 
enough Ledge wouldn&#39;t hear her.  That was her plan, at least.  She 
wasn&#39;t quite old enough to leave, yet, but her birthday was only two 
days away.  And why miss the ferry if she was going to be leaving so 
soon anyway?  But, if Ledge didn&#39;t get moving she&#39;d end up missing the 
ferry anyway.

	&quot;And why not?&quot; Ledge questioned with out even facing the pouting 
girl.  She wasn&#39;t trying to be overly strict, and would&#39;ve talked to 
Alundra&#39; parents had they said no; she just wanted them to know so they 
wouldn&#39;t worry.  They already hated Ledge tainting their daughter&#39;s mind 
with her stories of her travels, so running off with Alundra wouldn&#39;t 
earn her any respect with them.  

	&quot;Cause, they&#39;d say no,&quot; Alundra retorted.  She was still wearing 
the pout.  It was her only weapon at this point.
	
	Ledge turned and smiled an odd little smile.  She never smiled 
that way when she spoke with anyone else, only Alundra.   And the &#39;odd 
little smile&#39; really made her look good.  Her face lit up when she was 
wearing it.  &quot;Of course they would.  Anyway, why do you want to go so 
bad?&quot;  It had been bugging Ledge for the longest time.  When she told 
the young girl that she was leaving she cried for hours.  Then, the next 
day that she spoke to her she told her that she wanted to go too.

	Her golden eyes looked to the ground, and she fumbled her words.  
&quot;Well, Ledge... I.&quot;

	Ledge made the tomboy look her in the face, &quot;You what?&quot;

	&quot;I...I... I don&#39;t know! I just want to go with you! It 
just...feels right! Like I&#39;m destined to go with you. And I...I want to 
protect you!&quot;  She shouted in one quick breath.  Tears ran from her eyes 
and she looked to the ground.  She didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d protect Ledge, 
but she&#39;d try.  But Alundra was fragile; if she went with Ledge she&#39;d be 
the one who would need the protecting.  Yet, she had this feeling.  This 
overwhelming feeling that she had to be with Ledge; that Ledge would 
need her.  

	Ledge grinned.  &quot;You are going to protect me&quot; she patronized.  
Alundra just nodded at her while wiping her eyes.  Ledge while still 
grinning stepped forward, &quot;Hmm,&quot; she stopped, &quot;Well, I do need a 
bodyguard.&quot;  Alundra smiled widely and looked hopeful. &quot;And I know I can 
trust you.  So I suppose you can have the job.&quot;  Another one of her odd 
smiles grew onto her face, &quot;Just... Don&#39;t mess up.&quot;

	Alundra dried her eyes, then ran forward and pouncing-hugged 
Ledge. They both collapsed to the ground, but the older woman acted as a 
cushion for her smaller friend, who was far heavier then she looked.  
Everything was set.  They were both going, and Alundra could protect 
Ledge, though she didn&#39;t know what exactly she&#39;d need to protect her 
from.

	&quot;Ah! Alundra!&quot; Ledge exclaimed as she attempt to squirm free from 
her captor.  But, the brunette didn&#39;t budge; she just kept her iron grip 
on the elder woman.  Finally, after earning a few stares both girls 
stood and dusted themselves off. 

	They went to the ferry, which wasn&#39;t an overly large boat.  It&#39;d 
take about two days to get to Truce, and then from there they&#39;d see the 
world.  This meant that the two of them would be trapped on the boat 
together for two days.  Ledge was okay with the idea even though she was 
used to traveling alone, where as Alundra was very pleased.  She always 
liked being around Ledge, though she never knew the exact reason why.  
It just felt right.

AN:
This is the redone version of Chapter One to Riding on an Angel&#39;s Wings.  
I decided to make it prettier for the people on Shoujo-Ai.com.  Though, 
I will end up posting it on FF.net, so don&#39;t feel to special people.  
Jenn, my girlfriend, will be proof reading it for me.  So if there are 
huge flaws it&#39;s HER fault, not mine.  But, don&#39;t be too harsh, &#39;cause I 
get defensive.  Anyway, I hope everyone likes it.
