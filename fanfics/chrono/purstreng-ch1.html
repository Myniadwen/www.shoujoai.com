<h1>The Purpose of Strength</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../chrono/index.html">Chrono Cross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/takemenew.html">La Parka Girl/Take Me New</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The tiny fishing village on the western side of the world had very 
little to offer. It was slow paced, low on entertainment, and in 
general the people didn&#146;t care too much for visitors that weren&#146;t 
interested in buying fish or boats. However; the one thing the tiny 
village had to its credit was, quite possibly, the finest bar in all 
the world, run by the most beautiful and most talented bartender. With 
a wide assortment of drinks and a gorgeous woman to stare at while 
drinking them, the local bar had become nearly worldwide news. The 
most worldly drunks didn&#146;t consider their pilgrimage of alcoholism 
complete without at least one visit, and to some the visit itself 
wasn&#146;t complete until they had gotten their feel of the beautiful 
bartender, complete with a harsh fling into the cold waters below the 
bar&#146;s dock. No matter how far their stay their stay was, nor how wet, 
the visitors always seemed to enjoy their time.

However; there were others that didn&#146;t go for the drinks, nor did they 
go for the beautiful bartender, in the hopes to brush up against her 
skin. Some went just for the company, or the chance to talk with the 
bartender alone. She was as well known for her listening as she was 
for her vivacious body, and just as much for her skill at mending 
broken hearts as she was for her ferocious temper. She was a mixed 
package, and most of the folks from around the world came for reasons 
known only to themselves.

After midnight, the bar was only open to a few select customers. And 
after two in the morning, it was only open to one.

Miki was seated comfortably on one of the barstools, leaning over it&#146;s 
frame and waiting patiently for her drink. As she was seated her long 
red hair trailed down towards the ground, and her legs were neatly 
folded atop one another, seated as an elegant lady while dressed like 
a flamboyant entertainer. For a moment she sat motionless, waiting 
patiently until a sound could be heard from behind the bar, and a 
figure quickly rose from it. A taller, muscular woman with pigtails 
rose up, and with expert fingers slipped a tall glass on the table, 
and proceeded to pour various liquids into it.

&#147;Tryin&#146; something new.&#148; She spoke with a slight accent that all the 
villagers possessed, though her was nowhere near as thick. &#147;Drink up 
as much as you want, so I can see just how this makes people react.&#148; 
Nearing the end of her concoction she had poured five different 
liquids into the glass, and stirred it hurriedly with a long wooden 
stem. She tossed the stem aside and offered it up towards the redhead, 
who took it in a hand and brought it to her lips. She took a long, 
slow sip, and nodded her quiet approval of the drink.

&#147;Great, great...&#148; The blonde smiled, and topped the drink off what the 
redhead had poured. She then sat her bottles down, and leaned on her 
waist alongside the bar. Her gloved right hand was draped across it&#146;s 
frame, while her head and upper body leaned slightly over, lazily 
propped against the frame. Miki looked to the bartender, and tilted 
her head as she regarded her form. Though she had been working for 
nearly fourteen hours she didn&#146;t seem the least bit tired, her body 
was devoid of any mark of sweat, and her hair was still perfectly 
placed in her pigtails. She looked down along her body to where an 
elaborate shirt opened up and revealed her chest and stomach, barely 
covering the large breasts the bartender was known for. She couldn&#146;t 
see much further below, but assumed it was the same short skirt she 
always wore. Miki took another drink from the new mix, and slowly 
shook her head from side to side.

&#147;You look great, Orlha.&#148; She spoke quietly, and only continued to talk 
when the other woman turned to her. &#147;How long&#146;ve you been working 
today? And you still look fabulous. Hell, after one show I look 
like...well...hell.&#148; She shrugged simply, and began to drink once 
again. The blonde sighed, and reached out her right hand to the other 
girl&#146;s face. She took her gloved finger and pressed it under her chin, 
slowly raising it to look up into her eyes. The deep blue of Miki&#146;s 
met with Orlha&#146;s green, and the bartender smiled, gently, to her.

&#147;What&#146;s botherin&#146; ya?&#148; She requested an answer simply, her finger 
still keeping Miki&#146;s head aloft. She let it slip away, and the 
dancer&#146;s head fell back down to its original position without 
assistance or sound.

&#147;....Nikki.&#148; She finally replied, and her shoulder shrugged in a mild 
sigh. &#147;I&#146;m always taking second place. Second place to this concert, 
second place to this fan, it just goes on and on.&#148;

&#147;Ah.&#148; Orlha nodded and let her arm go back to supporting her lean 
against the bar. She had heard the story numerous times before, and 
had long since run out of new ways to deal with the situation. She 
thought for a moment, and simply shrugged. She looked over at Miki 
with a sideways glance, and her eyes trailed down the length of her 
body. The tight fitting dancer outfit looked nearly painted onto her 
body, the sheer skirt she wore was incredibly see-through by design, 
and she could visible make out the lines where Miki&#146;s undergarments 
were placed. Without a word Orlha reached over, and placed her gloved 
hand upon Miki&#146;s shoulder, gently jostling her as she finally began to 
speak once again.

&#147;Let&#146;s go for a swim.&#148; She said quietly, and motioned to the outside. 
&#147;Come on...my muscles are kind of sore from the workload tonight.&#148;

For a moment Miki paused, but with another sip of the new drink she 
shrugged, and slowly stood up. Again without a word she followed 
behind Orlha, stepping nearly in her footsteps as the pair left the 
bar, and proceeded around to the back. Orlha reached down, and began 
to remove her long green boots. Soundlessly Miki did the same with her 
pink ones, and then continued on to take off her skirt and then her 
gloves, removing all extra clothing save for the pair of undergarments 
she possessed. After a second&#146;s time of adjusting and removing 
clothes, she looked over to Orlha, and nearly fell over from surprise. 
The bartender stood with her back to the dancer, her body outlined in 
the faint light of the moon, bare.

&#147;Orlha...!&#148; Miki&#146;s voice finally cried out, and she took a cautionary 
step towards the blonde girl. Orlha gave no immediate reply, and 
instead reached up to pull the strands from her pigtails. Without 
rebellion her hair fell back, and into a neatly done flow that coursed 
to the swell of her back. She finally turned around, exposing her full 
body to the dancer. Though she tried not to look Miki could 
immediately make out the lines of rippling muscles all along Orlha&#146;s 
body, the result of countless battles and the handiwork of many drunk 
tosses. Her breasts were large and incredibly firm, and though Orlha 
stood without a bit of shame, Miki tried hard not to look to the other 
girl&#146;s body.

&#147;Orlha, please!&#148; She protested silently, worried that onlookers were 
there to hear her voice. &#147;Put something on!&#148; The blonde simply 
shrugged, and stepped up closer to the dancer. Without a word the bare 
girl reached her left hand out, and forcefully grabbed the chin of the 
dancer. She pulled her head to meet her own, and looked at her again 
deep in her eyes. Miki&#146;s eyes were forced to watch Orlha&#146;s, and for a 
moment she could feel her own hands reaching outward, as if they were 
unconsciously trying to grasp at the stronger girl&#146;s flesh. She 
stopped her motions desperately, and let them fall once again to her 
still-clad waist. Orlha smiled, and arched an eye as she regarded 
Miki&#146;s shocked expression.

&#147;You need attention.&#148; She spoke the words quietly, and accented their 
meaning with a slightly lighter grip on Miki&#146;s chin. As she spoke her 
free hand trailed out, and Miki could feel the pressure of a strong 
hand laid upon her thin waist. Four feet below them the water under 
the dock was rustling, a slight ripple through its form that caused 
just enough motion to create a gentle, pleasing noise. Miki closed her 
eyes, and let herself listen to more of Orlha&#146;s words.

&#147;You need attention...&#148; The bartender repeated, and moved even closer 
to the dancer. &#147;You need...someone, who can give you their attention.&#148; 
She squeezed gently upon Miki&#146;s waist, her fingers digging gently into 
the soft flesh that laid beneath. Miki slowly rose her head, and 
tilted it as she regarded Orlha. Since the journey they had been close 
friends, but...more? Without a second reprieve her arms stretched out, 
and she could feel her own fingers run up and across Orlha&#146;s waist, 
trailing across the muscled flesh and interlocking around her back. 
Before her mind could think of words to respond, her lips were already 
upon Orlha&#146;s. The work of her own doing, a kiss of her own creation. 
Her body had given into Orlha even before her mind had, but within a 
few fleeting seconds the two were both again working as one.

The two kissed deep, standing upon the edge of the dock. Orlha&#146;s 
stronger arms were formed into a tight grip around Miki&#146;s form, and 
she held the smaller girl close and somewhat aloft, held high enough 
that Miki had to extend out her toes to still be considered standing. 
Their tongues pressed hard and fierce into one another&#146;s and before 
long Miki could feel Orlha&#146;s arms lifting her more into the air, 
slowly inching toward the water. A smile formed upon her lips as she 
kissed, and she closed her eyes for what she knew would come soon.

&#147;Take a deep breath...&#148; Orlha whispered in between the deep kiss, and 
after another long probe with her tongue to Miki&#146;s mouth, she held on 
tight and leaped off from the dock. Miki broke the kiss in a fit of 
laughter as she tumbled off the dock whilst in Orlha&#146;s arms, and she 
could feel her legs instinctively reach up, locking around the 
stronger girl&#146;s back and clinging to her tightly in the darkness of 
the night.

For seconds they flew through the air locked together, and shortly 
afterwards the intense rush of water covering their bodies could be 
felt. With a loud splash they both went tumbling into the waters 
below, and within a matter of seconds both were dog paddling in the 
deep lake, their chests just a bit below the water line. Without a 
further word the two drenched women pulled together and kissed once 
more, their tongues exploring one another&#146;s mouth while their wet hair 
slipped together and tangled as one. Miki could feel strong arms reach 
around her waist once more, and she lifted high her legs as she felt 
the ones of the other girl peddling hard. She pressed herself deeper 
into the kiss, and for a moment marveled at the strength Orlha 
possessed. After a long work day she still had the strength to hold 
them both aloft in the water, with only her legs paddling to keep them 
afloat. The dancer moaned gently around the kiss they continued to 
share, and her arms reached down and coursed over the powerful 
shoulders of Orlha.

&#147;You&#146;re so strong...&#148; She whispered, breathlessly, and as she 
whispered her lips brushed up and down along Orlha&#146;s. &#147;I&#146;ve never been 
with anyone so strong...Nikki&#146;s so...frail.&#148; Orlha simply smiled, and 
pressed one or two hard kisses into the lips of Miki.

&#147;It&#146;s important to be strong...&#148; She murmured quietly, and Miki could 
almost instantly feel the hands on her waist moving and groping, 
prying at the undergarments she had worn during the dive. As Orlha 
spoke they were pulled from her body without mention, and before a few 
seconds had passed Miki could see them floating away in the dark, 
black water. Suddenly the water covered her lower body, and her eyes 
closed gently at the subtle sensation. Outside of a bath she had never 
experienced water rolling over every inch of her form, and the 
slightly warm waters of the lake below the bar felt wonderfully 
sensual upon her skin. She could feel Orlha&#146;s fingers gripping tight 
to her waist once more, and again feverish kisses were forced upon her 
lips. She did the best she could to kiss back into them, but they 
seemed to be designed to be controlling, and powerful. Miki smiled, 
and blushed despite herself.

&#147;Sorry, I&#146;m not so strong...&#148; She whispered gently, and her fingers 
trailed along and pressed down into the crook of Orlha&#146;s neck, where 
her shoulders began. The blonde smiled once more.

&#147;It&#146;s all right.&#148; Orlha whispered back, and continued her slow process 
of dog paddling. The sound of her legs beating in the water could 
faintly be heard, and as she was held Miki barely felt the movement.

&#147;After all...&#148; Orlha continued her thought with a tighter grip on 
Miki&#146;s waist. &#147;If you were strong...I&#146;d have no one to protect.&#148; She 
smiled, and forced a strong kiss upon Miki&#146;s lips, to silence any 
words she could have spoken. After a deep dance with one another&#146;s 
lips, Orlha removed her mouth and continued to talk once more.

&#147;You&#146;re physically weak...&#148; She spoke the words quietly, but the smile 
on her lips told Miki it was far from being an insult. &#147;But that&#146;s not 
bad. It means your strength is elsewhere. Places I&#146;m not strong in.&#148; 
She smiled wide, and tilted her head.

&#147;Like...you&#146;re beautiful.&#148; Her words are gone done even lower, and to 
a point they even sounded sad. She leaned her face closer to Miki&#146;s, 
and fit her forehead in against the dancer&#146;s. Their noses touched as 
the stronger girl spoke, and her whispered breath gently caressed her 
new lover&#146;s lips. &#147;You know that...?&#148; Air kissed at Miki&#146;s lips. 
&#147;You&#146;re...beautiful.

Miki could only close her eyes, and tighten her grip around Orlha&#146;s 
neck. Their lips met once more, and the dance in the water continued.

For moments the pair simply kissed while afloat, Miki perched in 
Orlha&#146;s strong arms, leaning into the bartender with all the passion 
she could. Orlha had no trouble keeping her afloat, and not once did 
the pair sink down any more than the bartender had intended. Her grip 
stayed strong around Miki&#146;s waist, and she squeezed her as tight as 
she could without causing harm. Before long their kiss was separated, 
and by the simple movement of their lips pulling apart, the water on 
their faces and in their hair rippled, trailing down in multiple 
streams across their face. For a moment both smiled wide, but neither 
dared rupture the sensitive silence with words. In the darkness all 
that could be heard was the sound of the rippling water, and far off a 
frog called out a cry for a mate. The night was like it was near 
death, as only those two sounds caused disturbance of the calm. As the 
two women stared at each other, their noses touching and their 
foreheads nearly connected, even those faint sounds seemed to 
disappear.

Before long Miki could feel herself being lifted higher, and the body 
of Orlha had slowly begun to move. She was directed over towards a 
nearby rock that seemed to jut perfectly out and into the water, below 
the water&#146;s surface by just a few inches. With care Orlha rested 
Miki&#146;s back against the rock, laying her down with all the care she 
would have given an infant. The dancer obediently stayed where she was 
laid, and watched with interest as the blonde proceeded below, around 
to her waist and then down the length of her legs, where her knees 
were bent and hanging down into the deeper water. Orlha smiled and 
gripped Miki&#146;s left leg with both of her strong hands, gripping and 
massaging the thin, barely noticeable muscles that the dancer 
possessed. She then watches as Orlha leaned in and kissed along her 
ankle, and then proceeded up along the back of her chin, gently kisses 
that could barely be felt, but nonetheless sent shivers up and down 
the dancer&#146;s spine. The kisses continued and as they did Orlha seemed 
to sink deeper into the water, as if she was riding Miki&#146;s shapely 
leg, like a trolley that continued down into her valley. At last Orlha 
reached the end of her ride, and her fingers of both hands reached 
out, pressing down into the flesh of Miki&#146;s mound.

Suddenly Miki could feel a wave of water coursing along her body, the 
warm liquid of the pond flowing over each and every one of her folds, 
tickling at her insides and seeping to her pores. Her head was thrown 
back in a gentle moan, and her arms both reached out at nothing, 
grasping at the sides where there was nothing to grip onto. She could 
feel Orlha&#146;s fingers pulling her gently apart and letting the water 
seep into her form, and her entire body quivered with the elegant 
sensation. She moaned once again, and let her eyes close as she leaned 
back. In the darkness she could barely make out Orlha&#146;s muscular body 
from her own body&#146;s length away, so she contented herself with 
concentrating on the feeling, rather than the sight. She laid back and 
relaxed, and let her mind shut off. She simply began to feel.

At first she felt a rough texture pressing against the very top of her 
valley, as if it was entreating further entrance to her insides. 
Before long she could guess it was Orlha&#146;s textured tongue, though the 
moisture all around her sex made it hard to determine just exactly 
where it was. She could sense by the position that she was being 
slowly licked all around her sex, not being penetrated but rather 
being circled, outlined in an invisible line made within the flow of 
water. The fingers moved out of the way to give the new player room, 
but they stayed present in the area as they both fit under the backs 
of her thighs, spreading her apart just a little bit more and giving 
the water and Orlha&#146;s tongue more room to work with. A few more 
seconds passed and the tongue coursed again along her sex, this time 
straight up the middle of her valley and dragging her flesh slowly 
upward. As the lick ended it was dropped back into place, but was not 
left undisturbed for long as the immediate sensation of penetration 
could be felt. Without warning Orlha&#146;s tongue was felt pressing into 
Miki&#146;s folds, pushing past the entrance and forcing its way inside. As 
it forced entrance so did the water of the lake, and Miki&#146;s senses 
were assaulted by not only Orlha&#146;s tongue, but the warm flowing water 
that it invited along with it. Her body felt as if it were being 
filled by the liquid, but as Orlha&#146;s tongue pulled out the water left 
as well, seeping and pouring out just as easily as it had entered. 
This action repeated itself twice, and after the third time it was 
signaled to be finished by another long upwards swipe along the 
outside of Miki&#146;s sex.

She felt mildly disappointed at the sudden disappearing of Orlha&#146;s 
tongue, but before long her mouth was opened wide in moan once more, 
as her senses were assaulted by yet another barrage of unique 
maneuvers. The tongue had returned to the inside of her valley but 
this time it was accompanied by a strong, wide finger. For two thrusts 
the two battled but eventually the tongue lost its place, and was 
forced to the upper rim of Miki&#146;s sex. There it ferociously beat back 
and forth across her upper folds while the wide finger continued to 
force its way in and out, pumping hard inside Miki&#146;s chasm with all 
the reaction of the warm water that the tongue enjoyed. Orlha&#146;s free 
hand was now placed directly under Miki&#146;s backside, holding her sex 
just below the water&#146;s surface but letting it fall no deeper. She 
could feel the brunt of a thumb pressed into her backside rose, and 
with a subtle motion of her own hips allowed the thumb to be pressed 
inside, just a little to increase the northern stimulation. The 
actions of the finger and tongue continued, and before long Miki could 
hear her own voice screeching out in moans and pants, though her mind 
denied making the sounds. Once again her body had grown to usurp 
control, and the sensation of lust sent shockwaves throughout her 
body. Before long her own hands had trailed to where her breasts were 
yet locked behind fabric. Without a care the fabric was discarded, and 
Miki was soon pinching and pulling at her breasts, with lust and 
desire as she rocked hard on Orlha&#146;s fingers and tongue.

The noise of splashing water and the sound of her lustful cries were 
soon cut off, and Miki fell into silence. Her eyes rolled back inside 
her head and her mouth dropped open in a silent gasp. Her body went 
tense, and for a moment she felt as if she were dead. Her senses had 
ceased for a split second in time, and for a few brief milliseconds 
she felt absolutely nothing. The time was brief though it seemed to 
last an eternity, and when it finally ended and time had resumed, Miki 
could feel a flood of her own fluids rush forward, meeting Orlha&#146;s 
finger and tongue and beating back the waves that continued to flood 
into her. Her hands reached out, and she trembled somewhat violently. 
Without a word or even another moan, she fell silent. Her arms fell 
into the water with a soft splash, and then rose up to float along its 
surface lazily. Her legs reacted similarly, and as Orlha rose up from 
her place at Miki&#146;s sex, a wide smile appeared upon her lips.

She reached her right hand out, and gently caressed the still blushing 
flesh of the sleeping Miki. Her strong fingers coursed slowly over the 
smaller girl&#146;s texture, and for a long time Orlha continued to stay 
aloft in the water, her fingers just rested upon Miki&#146;s soft cheek.

&#147;I&#146;m strong...&#148; The bartender whispered, and slowly stepped out from 
the water. She reached down to take the dancer into her mighty arms, 
and held her close in a way that both of their bodies&#146; most delicate 
parts were covered. She looked to where her bar lied upon the dock, 
and then back to the water once more. She held her head down to the 
sleeping dancer&#146;s ear, and whispered into it with a soft, subtle 
breath.

&#147;I&#146;m strong...&#148; She repeated, and a faint blush appeared upon her 
cheeks. &#147;But it&#146;s you that makes me...powerful.&#148;

Without another word she walked towards her bar. Whether it was the 
drink from before or the lust of the past few minutes, the frail 
dancer in the bartender&#146;s arms was going to need a full night&#146;s sleep.

All the next day, the famous bar was closed.
