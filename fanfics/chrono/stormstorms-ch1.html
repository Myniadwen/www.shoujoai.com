<h1>The Storms, of the Storms!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../chrono/index.html">Chrono Cross</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jiyuu.html">Jiyuumasurao</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	The rain poured down the walls of the house. The wood that they 
had put against the windows was doing it&#39;s job nicely. Leena, being the 
kind-hearted woman she was, insisted that Kid take the bed. She sat in 
the corner while Kid slept. She was home for the first time in months. 
She, Kid and Serge had been out travelling. They got stranded once in 
the El Nido Triangle. At that time, Serge, being a strong and full of 
stamina, left the island to go find a boat.

	So Kid and Leena stayed behind on the island. Living off nothing 
but coconuts, sea water and the occasional glimpse of what might be a 
boat drawing nearer to spur their hopes. After two nights, a huge storm 
came. Leena and Kid huddled together for warmth in the make-shift 
shelter. Together they lasted it out. When at last the sun broke the 
dawn, the looked into each other&#39;s eyes.

	Both had thought they would surely perish in the winds and rain. 
Kid drew her arms a little more tightly around Leena. Leena did the 
same. Then Kid brought her lips to hers. Her lips were surprisingly warm 
and smooth considering they hadn&#39;t been in good weather for more than 
ten days at any given time. Kid forced Leena backwards, however gently 
not to break the kiss. On her back, Kid lay on top of her and began to 
play at the hem of her shirt. Leena obligingly gave Kid a hand slipping 
it off her. Running her hands along Leena&#39;s smooth sides, Kid lapped 
more fiercly at the insides of Leena&#39;s mouth.

	Then Kid moved her hands so slowly towards Leena&#39;s breasts. First 
enticing Leena with the lightest touch right under them, then 
deliberately running her finger up and down the valley between Leena&#39;s 
two beautiful breasts. Kid&#39;s hands were then swift and soft. They went 
straight for both of Leena&#39;s nipples, now hard from excitement. Pinching 
at the little nubs, Kid drew satisfying sighs and moans and arches out 
of Leena. Deciding Leena didn&#39;t want her to stop, Kid broke the kiss.

	She immediately moved her mouth down to Leena&#39;s breasts. Kissing 
the sides and in the valley. Drawing intricate little circles with her 
tongue every now and then near Leena&#39;s nipple. &quot;No, Kid! Don&#39;t tease!&quot; 
Leena moaned as Kid drew yet another circle. Taking Leena&#39;s orders Kid 
moved her mouth on top of Leena&#39;s right nipple, and carressed her left 
breast with her hand, Kid began to suckle on the nub like a newborn. 
Encircling it again and again. Leena was in a state of pure euphoria by 
now. Noises coming out of her mouth that might have been words had she 
been less crazed. Then suddenly Kid bit down gently  on Leena&#39;s nipple. 
A huge cream erupted out of Leena&#39;s mouth.

	Then the door to the shelter blew open and in bolted Serge. &quot;What 
is it?!&quot; He screamed. When he saw what Kid and Leena were doing, he 
quickly looked away. But in doing so, his body turned sideways, 
revealing the massive erection he had. Leena and Kid simultaneously 
shouted &quot;Perv!&quot; And lunged away from each other. Leena throwing her 
shirt back on had flushed a dark, dark pink. Kid, standing awkwardly 
away form the other two, had a look of loathing on her face.

	&quot;Who are you to walk in on us?!&quot; Bellowed Kid. &quot;Thought you&#39;d have 
right ol&#39; laugh catching us in the middle of it?&quot;

	&quot;No! It&#39;s not like that!&quot; Screamed Serge. Kid had, anyway, drawn 
out her Spectral Dagger. &quot;I just heard a scream when I arrived on the 
island and I thought you two were in trouble!&quot;

	None of them had spoken of it since. Leena sat up. The memory of 
that event was so vivid that it felt real. She looked down and saw her 
hand lightly pinching her nipple. She drew it away abruptly. She 
couldn&#39;t think of that. Serge was going to propose any day. She had to 
get over that tiny little fling she and Kid had shared. Well, almost.

	She got up and went down the hall for a walk. She decided to go 
down into her father&#39;s workshop, which is where they kept their drinking 
water. She drew herself a large glass of ice cold water from the 
container, and sat on the desk to think. She sat and looked at the 
place, where in Another World, Mojo would be standing, dancing away to 
some tune he only could hear. 

	She still wasn&#39;t used to the idea of there being two worlds. She 
then laughed to herself and said aloud, &quot;If these two worlds are from 
choices, doesn&#39;t that mean another world is created every choice we 
make?&quot;

	&quot;Very quizzical.&quot; Said a voice from behind her. &quot;I woke up and you 
weren&#39;t there. I was worried something had happened.&quot;

	&quot;No, I just needed a little walk and a glass of water.&quot; Leena 
explained. &quot;I couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m surprised I could in that terrifying racket.&quot; Kid whispered. 
&quot;I&#39;m really scared Leenie. It doesn&#39;t sound natural.&quot;

	Leena lifted her arm towards Kid and drew her down beside her. She 
wrapped her arm around Kid&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Just try to think of something 
else. Just be glad you don&#39;t have so many things to think about that you 
don&#39;t notice the storm.&quot;

	&quot;Aww.. Leenie... Just relax&quot; Kid replied as she snuggled up 
against Leena. Her head falling on Leena&#39;s frail shoulder.

	Leena looked down at Kid. Kid. So dominant and proud. Yet so 
fearful and shy. Kid&#39;s breathing eventually slowed and she grew limp 
against Leena&#39;s hold. Realizing she herself were also nodding off, she 
slipped her right arm under Kid&#39;s knees and lifted her up. &quot;Oh Kid, you 
truly live up to your name.&quot;

	Leena carried Kid&#39;s light body easily up the stairs and into their 
shared room, layed Kid down on the bed and drew the covers up over her. 
Noticing how light and sparse the blanket was, Leena slid Kid over and 
got in the bed next to her. She put her arms around Kid and gave her one 
kiss on the forehead and went to sleep.
