<h1>Promises Kept (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../tsukikage/index.html">Tsukikage Ran</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The tall, dark brown haired woman paused by the tree,
feeling the soothing breeze touch her cheek, the
silence and calm still very soothing. &quot;Yes,&quot; she
murmured to herself softly, the white traveling coat
that a samurai wore blowing around her slim body,
&quot;this is the spot... and the village shouldn&#39;t be far
away.&quot;

Moving away from the trees she strode off, baggy
leggings flowing as she walked on, guided by an
excelent memory and the scents being carried on the
afternoon breeze. Soon she reached the bustling town,
feeling the wary gazes from the passerby who were
unused to seeing a masterless samurai traveling in
their midst. She walked on, eyes scanning her
surroundings until she found the shop she was looking
for.

The rice bowl resturant was almost exactly as she
remembered it being, but the three young men who were
standing there behind the counter were a bit of a
surprise. &quot;The Bonsai brothers?&quot; she murmured,
smiling.

&quot;Lady samurai!&quot; the tall man exclaimed, looking at her
in shock then the lanky man grinned at her in pure
welcome.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; the fat, middle brother blurted.

&quot;M&#39;lady!&quot; the third gasped.

From the back a figure emerged from behind a curtain,
her black hair tied up gracefully and her face touched
with a delicate kind of beauty. &quot;Brothers,&quot; she chided
them gently as she asked, &quot;what&#39;s going on...?&quot;

&quot;Look, Sakura!&quot; the eldest brother cut her off in his
excitement, gesturing towards their familiar looking
visitor.

Sakura&#39;s eyes widened in surprise then they softened
as a gentle smile tugged at her lips. &quot;You&#39;ve come
back, Lady Samurai,&quot; she murmured as she walked to
where the samurai stood by the door, looking up at her
happily.

&quot;My name is Ran,&quot; the samurai answered haltingly,
surprisingly glad to see the welcome in the other
woman&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Sakura said warmly. &quot;Have you come
back to feed your argumentative stomach?&quot; she teased
her gently.

Ran fought back a little smile, remembering the first
time that they had met. Shortly after a brisk fight at
the edge of town Ran&#39;s stomach had been loudly
complaining about a lack of food, so loudly that she
had felt obligated to argue back with it. Sadly Sakura
had been near enough to overhear the conversation, but
she had found the odd behavior so amusing that she
decided to feed Ran instead.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Ran answered her honestly, &quot;in fact, I
came to pay off my tab here.&quot; With that she reached
into her white overshirt, drawing forth her coins and
moving yo plunk them down on the counter nearby.

Sakura looked up at her in honest surprise for a
moment, then the beautiful young lady began to softly
laugh. In only a moment she had to lean up against the
wall to steady herself, wiping at her tearing eyes as
she fought her mirth back.

&quot;I seem to have been funny again,&quot; Ran said with a
tentative smile, reaching up to scratch at the back of
her head.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Lady samurai,&quot; Sakura finally managed to
get herself under control, &quot;I couldn;t help it. You&#39;re
money&#39;s no good here.&quot; As Ran was about to protest
that she continued, &quot;You&#39;ve done so much for this
town, not to mention my brothers, I could never repay
it.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Ran started, blushing faintly.

The taller brother gave Ran a warm smile, &quot;You saved
us from a life of banditry or worse, m&#39;lady. I don&#39;t
think any of us would be here if not for you.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; the middle brother nodded.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the third chimed in.

Ran met their eyes, remembering the three very foolish
swordsman that she had once met. Obviously they had
grown up a lot since then, for Ran couldn&#39;t easily
imagine the three fools they had once been working so
contentedly in this rice resturant.

&quot;That doersn&#39;t mean,&quot; Ran said to them firmly, &quot;I
shouldn&#39;t pay my tab. Besides, I gave my word that I
would.&quot;

Sakura looked at her thpoughtfully, her lips still
curving up in a caring smile. &quot;All right,&quot; she
acknowledged as she took the samurai&#39;s coins, &quot;I
understand.&quot; She remembered what coins Ran had left
last time and seperated out what she still owed,
passing the rest back expertly.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ran murmured as Sakura handed back the
change, their fingers brushing softly and bringing a
surprising tingle in her hand.

Sakura studied Ran thoughtfully then asked, &quot;Are you
hungry?&quot;

In the silence the soft sound of Ran&#39;s stomach growl
was loud, if a bit embarassing. Ran smiled, &quot;I guess
that answers your question?&quot;

&quot;Come on, then,&quot; a chuckling Sakura took Ran&#39;s hand
and tugged her over to a table, sitting down beside
her as her brothers quickly produced a bowl for Ran.

Like any wanderer who went long periods between meals
Ran ate with determination, but she still paused for
conversation. Gently she asked, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen your
uncle, is he...?&quot;

&quot;He passed away not long after you left,&quot; Sakura said,
meeting Ran&#39;s compassionate eyes, &quot;but I think he was
happy, especially knowing his son, my fiance, was
avenged.&quot;

Ran paused a moment in eating, &quot;Then I&#39;m glad.&quot;

Sakura watched in awe as Ran demolished three bowls of
rice in minutes, the other woman finally sighing in
contentment as she finished. As she reached for her
coins Sakura stoped Ran and smiled, &quot;At least let me
give you this meal.&quot;

Ran studied her for a moment, then she looked around
the well maintained, prosperous resturant. &quot;If you
wish,&quot; Ran said, &quot;but is there anyway I could repay
you?&quot;

&quot;What are your plans?&quot; Sakura asked, looking at Ran
thoughtfully.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ran admitted, &quot;I have no plans. I just
realized I was nearby and had enough to pay my
debt...&quot;

&quot;Then maybe you could visit for awhile,&quot; Sakura
offered. A smile teased her lips, &quot;I believe my
brothers have a new bottle of fine sake, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ran looked eager, then she blushed at how
obvious she was being. &quot;I see you know my weakness?&quot;
she asked impishly.

&quot;A young sake maker visited not long after you left,&quot;
Sakura admitted as they left the resturant together,
&quot;and he mentioned you. I have to admit I rather
interrogated him.&quot; She reached out, taking Ran&#39;s hand
in hers as they walked close, &quot;You disapeared so
quickly, I never had the chance to thank you.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to,&quot; Ran answered, following through
town to a older home, once rundown and now restored,
&quot;I did what I did because I wanted to.&quot; She took her
sandals off as they entered and went into a common
room, &quot;And I could never stand seeing that kind of
behavior.&quot;

Sakura chuckled as she left the room, returning a
moment later with a jug in her hands. She settled down
beside Ran on the floor and poured her a drink as she
said, &quot;I think that&#39;s one of the things I admire about
you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ran took the saucer and tossed back the
sake, sighing happily. She poured the next drink and
paused, &quot;I remember how frightened you were, when I
fought your brothers... I hated seeing that look on
your face.&quot;

Sakura put her hand on Ran&#39;s shoulder, squeezing it
gently. &quot;If you hadn&#39;t my brothers would still be
trying to be foolish bandits or worse,&quot; she said
softly. She smiled, &quot;When I thought of you I
remembered laughing and kindness... and how striking
you were, when those bbandits tried to rob us.&quot;

Ran took another drink as she softly confessed, &quot;I
thought of you, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Sakura sighed, sitting a bit nearer to
Ran. She poured herself a drink too, sippinng it a bit
more delicately. &quot;This is very bold of me,&quot; she said
softly, &quot;are you... with someone?&quot;

Ran looked at her thoughtfully, &quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Not even Meow?&quot; Sakura asked hopefully.

&quot;We&#39;re friends,&quot; Ran said, searching Sakura&#39;s eyes as
she added, &quot;nothing more.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Sakura looked away shyly. She drank a bit
more, &quot;Honestly, I haven&#39;t been able to banish you
from my mind. Your smile, your laughter and your
gentle touch, they all seem to haunt me unexpectedly.&quot;

&quot;And do you want them to go?&quot; Ran asked softly.

&quot;No, I want to experience them again,&quot; Sakura
confessed with a blush, &quot;and more.&quot;

Ran set her sake down carefully, reaching out to
gently cup Sakura&#39;s chin, bending close until their
lips nearly touched. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked, her
breath lightly caressing Sakura&#39;s face.

&quot;Very,&quot; and Sakura pulled her down into a kiss.

End

Notes: Based of the first few episodes, more or less.
Ran has been compared to Xena, Warrior Princess,
though I have to admit the subtext level is much less.
Ran wanders the land, often saving damsels in
distress, but there isn&#39;t much romantic pay off in the
series. I do like the banter between Ran and her
sidekick Meow, tho.</pre>
