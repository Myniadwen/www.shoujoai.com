<h1>Forever</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../inuyasha/index.html">InuYasha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/akimei.html">Akimei</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  Sango sat stairing up at the starry night sky. She was sitting in 
front of the campfire, Inuyasha sleeping in a tree, of course, Miroku 
sleeping across from her and Kagome&#39;s futons. Shippou slept next to 
Kagome and Kirara was to Sango&#39;s other side.
  The demon huntress looked to the side to Kagome&#39;s sleeping face. She 
was so cute when she was sleeping. Like an angel. She smiled faintly 
at the girl, remaining asleep and oblivious to the Huntress&#39; eyes.
  &quot;Kagome-chan...&quot; Sango mumbled to herself, perposly so her friend 
wouldn&#39;t hear her. She turned her gaze back up to the starry night 
sky. &quot;Aisheteru...&quot; she finished in an even quieter tone than before.
  Even though she hadn&#39;t said a word, Sango could tell that Kagome was 
waking up. No one could surprise her. At least not most of the time...
  &quot;Sango-chan?&quot; Kagome sat up to look at the Demon Huntress 
questioningly, her eyes half closed. She reached up a hand and rubbed 
her eye yawning quietly. Sango smiled without turning to her.
  &quot;Yes?&quot; Sango asked. Kagome smiled.
  &quot;What are you doing awake? It&#39;s really late at night. Why are you 
up?&quot; she asked gently. Sango turned her head to the girl, now sitting, 
beside her.
  &quot;I just couldn&#39;t sleep...&quot; Sango replied, &quot;You know, The stars are 
really beautiful tonight.&quot; Kagome&#39;s eyes opened fully at Sango&#39;s 
slightly unexpected statement. She soon smiled and turned her head to 
the sky to join her friend.
  &quot;Yeah... Stars are always so beautiful... You can hardly see stars 
at night where I live.&quot; Kagome responded. Sango allowed her eyes to 
focus on a single star.
  &quot;I always used to gaze at the stars at night. Kohaku would wake up 
and find me. He used to laugh and so how silly I was. I would just 
ruffle his hair send him back inside...&quot; Sango explained, her eyes 
suddenly becoming a bit sad.
  &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Kagome looked downwards to the blazing fire as it 
flickered about.
  Sango turned her head back to Kagome. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Kagome-chan. Why 
are you appologizing?&quot; she asked. Kagome sighed.
  &quot;I... wish it hadn&#39;t happened...&quot; she responded, sadly.
  &quot;But... Then I wouldn&#39;t have met... you.&quot; Sango said, moving her arm 
over and taking Kagome&#39;s chin between her thumb and index finger. She 
turned the girl&#39;s head to face her.
  Kagome wore an expression of absolute shock on her face. &quot;Uh, 
Wha--?&quot;
  &quot;You&#39;re my best friend... I&#39;m glad I met you...&quot; she said, and 
Kagome smiled. Sango&#39;s hand moved to slide up, cupping the other 
girl&#39;s face in her palm.
  Kagome leaned into Sango&#39;s head, closing her eyes. &quot;Me too...&quot; 
Kagome whispered.
  &quot;Kagome-chan?&quot; Sango asked, softly receiving a &quot;mm hm&quot; from her 
friend.
  &quot;I... wanted you to know something.&quot; the Demon Huntress replied. 
Kagome opened her eyes slowly.

  &quot;Okay. What&#39;s up?&quot; the Miko asked. Sango sighed, before bringing up 
her other hand and cupping it over Kagome&#39;s other cheek. She leaned 
forward until her lips were just an inch from the other girl&#39;s face.
  &quot;I love you.&quot; Sango breathed, the words brushing against Kagome&#39;s 
soft lips, causing her to shiver a bit. She was then surprised even 
further when she felt Sango press her lips tenderly against her own.
  Sango closed her eyes gently as did the other girl. What happened 
next confused Sango and shocked her beyond imagining...

  Kagome returned the gently pressure of the Huntress&#39; kiss, gently 
massaging the girl&#39;s lips with her own. She pulled up her arms, 
wrapping them around Sango&#39;s neck.
  Sango&#39;s hands slid around the girl&#39;s cheeks, to cup the back of her 
head in both hands, pulling her closer. She felt the soft tingling 
sensation as Kagome sighed contently against her lips.
  A moment later, Sango pulled back, her eyes opening slowly. She 
gained a slightly sad look, her eyes moving away from Kagome&#39;s face.
  &quot;Kagome, I--&quot; Sango started, but Kagome brought her right arm from 
around Sango&#39;s neck and pressed a finger gently to Sango&#39;s bottom lip. 
Sango turned her head back around to look at the Miko.
  &quot;I love you too, Sango-chan.&quot; Kagome said softly and Sango smiled as 
Kagome removed her finger, replacing her arm around Sango&#39;s neck her 
right hand bracing Sango&#39;s head. She smiled at her softly, sweeping 
away any confusion in Sango&#39;s expression. The Demon Huntress smiled in 
a way she hadn&#39;t in quite a long time. She smiled out of pure 
happiness. She felt loved for the first time. She was in love.
  Kagome broke her out of her reverie, by pressing her lips up against 
Sango&#39;s in a very similar motion as to what Sango had done moments 
before. Sango smiled against her friend&#39;s lips... She finally felt 
that she was were she belonged; In the arms of the one she was in love 
with... The pure-hearted miko from another era, who had stolen her 
heart since the day she&#39;d met her... Kagome...

  Miroku tweaked open an eye to watch the two girls. He couldn&#39;t help 
but wonder if they&#39;d be doing this on a regular basis... Now -that- 
was something he could get used to... He gulped silently. That is, As 
long as Sango didn&#39;t notice him watching. A horrific image of Sango 
lopping off his head with her katana crossed his mind... &#39;Better not 
bother them...&#39; he decided, &#39;But, I can still watch from a safe 
distance... Heheh...&#39;

  &quot;Hmm...&quot; Inuyasha sat, cross-legged, in the top limb of the tree, 
staring down at Sango and Kagome. &#39;It figures. Two girls in one 
lifetime... What are the odds?... Oh well.&#39; He sighed, then looked 
back up. &quot;So, Sango decided to tell her after all... It&#39;s about time.&quot;

  Once Sango and Kagome pulled appart for air, Sango smiled gently to 
Kagome. She then looked up at the starry night sky as did Kagome, 
Watching the star that Sango&#39;d been focusing on earlier as if 
brightened then glanced to the star beside it which was barely shining 
at all. Sango smiled up at the sky, as the stars reminded her of 
herself and Kagome. Kagome shined the brightest of all where as she 
was darkened by shadows.
  Kagome looked at Sango&#39;s face, and smiled coyly at the other girl&#39;s 
expression. She knew what the other girl was thinking. &quot;I know, 
Sango-chan... Me too.&quot;
  Sango brought her gaze back down to Kagome. She had never really 
paid much attention to the second star. Just the brightest one. 
Because it stood out. But, Come to know, It belonged next to the other 
star and it&#39;s brightness caused the darkner star to appear more 
clearly... And likewise.
  &quot;Aisheteru, Kagome-chan.&quot; Sango spoke up suddenly, looking back down 
to the other girl. Kagome pulled herself onto Sango&#39;s lap, her arms 
still wrapped around the Huntress&#39; neck as she leaned onto her, her 
head resting gently against Sango&#39;s left shoulder. She gazed up at the 
sky, the lowered the gaze to Sango who was staring at her 
questioningly. The stars and moon in the night sky giving off a pale 
glow that touched against Sango&#39;s lovely features perfectly.
  &quot;I love you too, Sango-chan.&quot; Kagome said, closing her eyes. Sango 
smiled at her, kissing her forehead. She then pulled Kagome closer to 
her, pulling Kagome into the center of her lap, and resting her chin 
against the top of her friend&#39;s head. At the moment, She didn&#39;t really 
care if Inuyasha, Shippou, Kirara or the Houshi were to see her. All 
that mattered was the person in her arms. The one she loved.
  Sango looked up slightly, and smiled at the starry night sky, before 
returning to the previous position and tightening her arms around 
Kagome. &quot;Now that you&#39;re here, Kagome-chan, You won&#39;t leave... I&#39;m 
going to keep you forever.&quot; she whispered into Kagome&#39;s hair. The girl 
heard her, and smiled secretly. No, She wouldn&#39;t be going anywhere. 
She wanted to stay right where she was... forever.
