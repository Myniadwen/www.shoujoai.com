<h1>Seconds Lives</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../inuyasha/index.html">InuYasha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kagome Hhigurashi didn&#39;t like coincidences, in her experience they were 
rarely good. &#39;Coincidence&#39; often seemed to hide deeper connections 
between people and events and after all the times she had helped fight 
Naraku she had time and again seen coincidences bite her and InuYasha in 
the butt.

So it was fair to say that Kagome was more than a bit disturbed when she 
found out that her class trip this year was to an archeological site, 
located roughly where she remembered Sango&#39;s village was in the past. 
The bus trip from their train to the hotel was loud with conversation as 
Kagome wondered what they would see, her feeling of anticipation and 
concern as they continued on to the town itself.

Yuuka shook her head as they got off the bus, her short hair falling 
across her cheek as she said, &quot;You&#39;d think the school could have come up 
with a more exciting place to go for our class trip.&quot;

Ayumi brushed back her long curly hair as she squinted up at the sun. &quot;I 
think it has something to do with a government history program,&quot; she 
suggested.

&quot;What do you think, Kagome?&quot; Eri wondered, her long hair as straight and 
neat as usual.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Kagome looked sheepish, startled out of her contemplation of the 
area around them. It was so familiar to her on one hand, the over all 
lay of the land echoing her memories but also different with the modern 
buildings off in the distance. The path their teacher was leading them 
on wound between piles of earth, trenches in the distance roped off 
where scientists presumedly studied the traces of the past.

Yuka sighed, &quot;Kagome, stop spacing out please.&quot;

Kagime blushed as she sighed, &quot;Sorry.&quot; Silently she thought to herself, 
&#39;How can I explain that I wasn&#39;t spacing out, that I was remembering 
visiting here before?&#39;

&quot;What do you think of this being our class trip?&quot; Eri asked Kagome 
again.

&quot;I think,&quot; Kagome hesitated a moment searching for the right words, &quot;it 
could be interesting.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m very impressed,&quot; Hojo cheerfully noted, the young man following 
close behind.

Ayumi covertly rolled her eyes as Yuka, Eri and Kagome fought back their 
giggles at the badly besotted boy. For months now he had politely 
pursued Kagome but the girl barely registered his presence. It was 
getting kind of pitiful, really.

&quot;All right, it&#39;s time to form up students,&quot; their teacher called out as 
she continued, &quot;our guide is waiting!&quot;

The boyish young woman standing beside their teacher wasn&#39;t quite what 
Kagome had been expecting. She was tall, with short hair and casual 
clothes, dark colored and now dusty from the site. Her hands were marked 
by hard work but her eyes had a amused, almost roguish quality to them.

&quot;My name is Mutsumi Yuhino,&quot; she smiled at them cheerfully, &quot;and I&#39;m the 
junior archeologist on the site.&quot; She gave them a charming smile, &quot;But 
that doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing because I&#39;m junior, it just 
means they can spare me the most today.&quot;

With a slight blush Ayumi leaned close to Yuka and whispered, &quot;She&#39;s 
kind of handsome, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

Softly Yuka conceded, &quot;Yeah, kind of.&quot;

Leading them through carefully fenced of areas of the dig Mutsumi 
cheerfully explained, &quot;The site was first discovered when a city works 
crew was clearing a section of forest. They stumbled over a piece of 
what was the fortified town&#39;s outer wall, someone realized it was old 
and they called the experts in.&quot;

AS she walked Mutsumi explained the process of how the university had 
been contacted, the site surveyed and a team was organized. With lively 
gestured she pointed out where they thought the chief had probably 
lived, the homes set around it and the forge they had unearthed.

&quot;So what kind of town was it?&quot; Eri asked.

&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Mutsumi admitted, &quot;it doesn&#39;t fit the model for 
communities of that era. They don&#39;t seem to have worked fields or raised 
cattle, they acquired their food and supplies by trade.. But trading 
what we don&#39;t know.&quot;

&#39;They traded their demon hunting services,&#39; Kagime thought, but knew 
that answer wouldn&#39;t help much.

&quot;Even stranger the inhabitants of the town were apparently wiped out 
almost all at once,&quot; Mutsumi added with some regret, &quot;we discovered a 
mass grave just outside the town and there seems to be no evidence of 
inhabitants after that.&quot; Smiling slightly she added, &quot;Local legends say 
the inhabitants were killed by demons.&quot;

&#39;It&#39;s no legend,&#39; Kagome thought sadly as they continued to walk through 
the oddly quiet archeological dig.

&quot;You&#39;ll notice not many people are working in the trenches today,&quot; 
Mutsumi said a bit apologetically, &quot;that&#39;s because many of our staff are 
busy with a new discovery. Apparently a warrior&#39;s grave has been found 
and our tentative dating of the artifacts there shows it was dug some 
years after the village was destroyed/&quot;

Kagome fought back a shiver at that, &#39;Is it Sango, I wonder? Or maybe 
poor Kohaku?&#39;

&quot;Do you think we could go see?&quot; their teacher asked excitedly. Or maybe 
she was excited by Mutsumi&#39;s not so subtle hand on her ass.

&#39;A perverted woman?&#39; Kagome thought, frowning a little as she tried to 
figure out who Mutsumi reminded her of.

Mutsumi thought about it then offered, &quot;As long as you stay well back, 
please. We don&#39;t want to interfere with the work.&quot;

With that they left the main set of digs in and around the village and 
proceeded towards a roped off area a short ways away. Surrounded by 
archeologists the pit was being photographed, measured, items carefully 
unearthed and generally a hotbed of activity.

&quot;This was a burial mound,&quot; Mutsumi revealed softly, &quot;the figure withing 
was first buried, then earth was heaped up over top as a sign of 
respect. Inside we&#39;ve begun to uncover various artifacts, including 
ceremonial armor and weapons.&quot;

A tough looking older woman separated herself from the other researchers 
and strode over, clearly looking annoyed. &quot;Mutsumi, what did I tell you 
about keeping the visitors away?&quot; she asked fiercely, her long hair tied 
up in a ponytail and her bangs cut straight across her forehead.

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; Mutsumi smiled charmingly, &quot;their teacher insisted.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; their teacher frowned at the exaggeration and blushed faintly.

Upon seeing that blush Setsuna fixed Mutsumi with a eerily familiar 
look, &quot;Were you being a pervert again?&quot;

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Mutsumi said sweetly.

&quot;Hmph.&quot; Setsuna rolled her eyes in exasperation then smiled slightly. &quot;I 
suppose I should be glad you just flirt,&quot; she conceded.

Kagome looked at the two familiar figures arguing and was struck by a 
stunning realization. Take away the modern clothing and surroundings, 
sub in the garb of InuYasha&#39;s era and the two women would be perfect 
copies of Sango and Miroku! &#39;Kikyo got reincarnated in me,&#39; she thought 
as she saw them talking fondly now, &#39;could it be they were too...?&#39;

&quot;Kagome, you&#39;re white as a sheet,&quot; she teacher noted worriedly.

Kagome started to tell her she was fine when things got dark... and she 
collapsed bonelessly to the ground.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Kagome...&quot; a gentle voice called, &quot;Kagome, wake up.&quot;

Weakly Kagome stirred, blinking her eyes as she looked up at a someone 
who was like a sister to her, &quot;Sango?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Setsuna smiled gently, &quot;sorry. Are you all right?&quot;

Kagome sat up, feeling deeply embarrassed over fainting like that. &quot;No, 
I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, looking around what was probably a first aid tent.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Setsuna gave her a faintly amused look, &quot;your friends 
mentioned your frail health.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Kagome blushed, thinking of some of the ridiculous excuses her 
family had used to cover for her time trips, &#39;it&#39;s a bit of a long 
story.&quot;

&quot;So, is our sleeping beauty awake?&quot; Mutsumi asked as she stuck her head 
in the tent flap.

&quot;I&#39;m all right now,&quot; Kagome said firmly.

&quot;I offered to give you a medicinal sponge bath,&quot; Mutsumi winked, &quot;but 
Setsuna put her foot down.&quot;

Kagome couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at that as Setsuna rolled her eyes and 
reached out to firmly punch Mutsumi in the shoulder.

&quot;Ow!&quot; Mutsumi yelped then gave Setsuna puppy dog eyes as Kagome giggled.

&quot;Just ignore this rogue,&quot; a smiling Setsuna said as she helped Kagome 
up.

&quot;Dr. Coral here,&quot; Mutsumi gestured to Setsuna, &quot;has kindly agreed to 
stop work for a short while so that your class can look at the site. 
Would you care to join us?&quot;

Reluctant to look but unable to come up with a reasonable excuse not to 
Kagome nodded, &quot;Okay.&quot;

Sensing her discomfort Setsuna tagged along as they walked back to the 
burial mound, a light breeze gently blowing their hair. The pit wasn&#39;t 
deep and still partially filled with dirt, the scientists only partially 
done their work. The flesh had rotted away from the figure laying there 
leaving only bone in very familiar looking armor, and the massive 
boomerang laying beside her confirmed her identity... it was Sango.

&quot;The armor is in remarkably good shape,&quot; Mutsumi noted, &quot;and we think 
that boomerang was some kind of ceremonial weapon...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Kagome found herself saying quietly, &quot;it was thrown.&quot;

&quot;Wha...&quot; Mutsumi started.

Setsuna reached out to put a quieting hand on Mutsumi&#39;s arm. &quot;What makes 
you say that?&quot; she asked Kagome thoughtfully.

Kagome debated making something up, then decided to try to explain in a 
way that they&#39;d understand. Kneeling down but being careful not to touch 
anything she pointed to one end of the boomerang, &quot;You see here, these 
grooves in the bone? It&#39;s rotted away now but there was probably leather 
or cloth wrapped around there to provide a grip to carry and throw it.&quot;

&quot;That could be true,&quot; Setsuna conceded after a moment, &quot;but you&#39;d need 
massive upper body strength to do that.&quot;

&quot;I bet you could do it,&quot; Mutsumi winked, &quot;you certainly hit me often 
enough.&quot; With a grin she ducked under a casual swing from Setsuna. &quot;My 
point is made.&quot;

Setsuna studied the bone boomerang a few moments then smiled slightly, 
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I buy your theory, Kagome, but I do like it.&quot; And with 
that she gave Kagome a very familiar grin.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

In the end, Kagome decided not to say anything to Setsuna and Mutsumi 
about her theory that they possibly were reincarnations of her friends 
Sango and Miroku. Not only was there no way she could prove to them that 
they were reincarnated, but Kagome failed to see what good it would do 
them. They both seemed quite happy in the here and now, and revealing 
the past life might spoil things for them.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Setsuna smiled slightly as she curled up in the bed beside her lover. 
&quot;I&#39;m still annoyed that you brought those students over to the burial 
mound,&quot; she informed her.

&quot;Even Kagome?&quot; Mutsumi wondered.

&quot;No,&quot; Setsuna admitted, &quot;not her.&quot; She paused, &quot;Did she seem... familiar 
to you? Almost like a old friend you hadn&#39;t seen in years?&quot;

&quot;Kind of,&quot; Mutsumi admitted.

&quot;That girl is interesting,&quot; Setsuna mused after a moment, &quot;maybe we 
should try to see her again.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Mutsumi agreed.

The End...?

Notes: This was originally going to be a InuYasha centric story 
involving the soul of Midoriko escaping the Shikon crystal, possessing 
InuYasha and taking off to try to carry out her last wish. And did I 
mention she changes InuYasha into a girl? lol Wisely I dropped the idea. 
Reincarnation in the InuYasha-verse is never entirely explained, so I 
felt it was all right to use it in this way. Naming the reincarnated 
characters was a bitch, but I decided to settle on using the same first 
letters of their names.</pre>
