----------------------------------------------------------------------

Kagome looked up from her herb picking in the field. The windswept 
plains looked so tranquil in comparison with her life. The reason such a 
thought came to her mind was because she was picking herbs to help with 
a wound Inuyasha had recently suffered. Inuyasha, what did he expect 
turning his back on a demon without making sure it was dead first. But 
no, he would rather take a fang through the chest than exercise a little 
caution. Strangely it wasn&#39;t she nor Miroku who had saved him from the 
demons mouth, it was Sango.

Suddenly Kagome turned very red. She couldn&#39;t afford to be thinking 
about Sango. If Inuyasha found out he would be shattered, and if Kouga 
found out he would tear Sango to shreds. Still, she loved to dream about 
Sango even though it scared her. At times she wished to be wrapped in 
Sango&#39;s arms and not Inuyasha&#39;s, to curl up with her, to feel Sango&#39;s 
sweet lips on hers. She blushed even deeper at this thought and resumed 
herb picking. It&#39;s not that she didn&#39;t love Inuyasha too, it&#39;s just that 
she seemed to love Inuyasha as though he were her guardian, and she 
loved Sango as though she were a part of her soul. She heard a cry in 
the distance. She also saw a flicker as though from a flame. It couldn&#39;t 
be? It was. Sango had come to give her a ride home. Strangely Kagome was 
happy at this concept, but no, she couldn&#39;t afford to express her 
feelings to Sango.

------------

Sango walked up to Kagome hoping to finally tell her how she felt. She 
was sure the young miko had feelings for her, and the more she dwelled 
on this thought, the more she came to realize she had feelings for the 
young miko. She had told Kirara to go back hoping to have some time to 
talk to the young miko. She walked up to Kagome and in a quiet voice 
said, &quot;Hello&quot;. 

Kagome looked up and said, &quot;Hi&quot;. 

Sango turned around and said, &quot;Let&#39;s take a walk&quot;. 

Excited at this concept over riding Kirara, Kagome gladly obliged and 
followed Sango to the woods.

------------

After walking a couple of silent hours Sango decided to ask Kagome a 
question. &quot;Kagome-sama?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Sango-chan?&quot; 

&quot;I have something that&#39;s been weighing on my mind lately.&quot; 

&quot;Oh no&quot;, Kagome thought, &quot;She knows. How could she have figured it out? 
Was she going to humiliate her right out now?&quot; 

&quot;Well Kagome-sama it&#39;s just... well y&#39;know how things sometimes are never 
meant to be?&quot; 

&quot;Here it comes&quot;,Kagome thought. &quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; Kagome replied. 

&quot;Well it&#39;s just that... that...&quot; Kagome was now blushing very deeply, and 
Sango picked up on this. &quot;Well I feel...feel...&quot; 

Suddenly tears started forming at Sango&#39;s eyes. &quot;How could I be so 
foolish?&quot; Sango said in a wail. 

Kagome was shocked at this, but quickly realized what was going on. Sango 
felt the same as she did. &quot;Sango-chan don&#39;t cry&quot;, Kagome said, &quot;It&#39;s 
okay, I feel the same way, I love Inuyasha, but never the same way I 
could you.&quot; Sango looked up, deep relief in her eyes. 

Seconds of silence passed until Sango got up and pressed her soft 
lips to Kagome&#39;s. &quot;Sango-cha...mmmm&quot;, Kagome&#39;s tried to say but her 
words were muffled by Sango&#39;s mouth. Suddenly, nothing mattered anymore. 
The two were content to stay there locked in this embrace forever, but 
they knew if they did not continue the others would get worried and come 
looking for them, and that would be too much stress then was needed for 
today. Sango and Kagome quickly continued walking onward towards 
whatever their future was together. 

Not aware that it was not Inuyasha nor Miroku they would have to face 
together, but the wolf that stalked Kagome even through peril.

------------

Miroku looked out on the two girls wrapped in each-other&#39;s embrace. He 
thought to himself, &quot;Wow what a show I get tonight.&quot; 

Suddenly, he heard Shippo coming down the path screaming, &quot;Kagome&quot;. He 
quickly caught and covered the little demon&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;This is not for you to see, as you would tell Inuyasha, and that&#39;s 
obviously not a good thing&quot;, Miroku said very sternly. 

&quot;Aww c&#39;mon just let me see&quot; , Shippo pleaded. All Shippo could tell from 
the sounds of voices he heard below that the two were Kagome and Sango.

------------

&quot;Inuyasha!&quot; , Shippo yelled. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Inuyasha said as he got up hastily from his nap in the trees. 
&quot;Hmmm if Shippo is here then Kagome is probably back&quot; ,he thought. 

Shippo ran up to him and said, &quot;Something&#39;s up with Kagome and Sango I 
think.&quot; 

&quot;So what!&quot;, Inuyasha exclaimed,&quot;girls always like to confess their 
problems with each other, especially Kagome, in case you haven&#39;t noticed 
she&#39;s not exactly the most open with us!&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Shippo said, &quot;Miroku was watching from afar, and told me I couldn&#39;t 
see, nor tell you what was going on.&quot; 

Suddenly it hit Inuyasha. &quot;Shippo it was probably nothing so don&#39;t 
worry,&quot; Inuyasha said shakily, &quot;Now head to bed and put these crazy 
worries of yours out of your mind.&quot; Shippo obliged and headed inside the 
the shack. 

&quot;So this is who Kagome has chosen,&quot; Inuyasha thought, &quot;She loves Sango. 
Well I should have saw this coming. She&#39;s always been acting funny around 
Sango, and now I know why. Well if this is the path she has chosen then I 
will stay by her side till the end&quot;, and with that Inuyasha headed back 
into an untroubled sleep.

END

------------

Well that&#39;s the end, I know it&#39;s pretty short but I kinda wanted it to 
cover in one page a sort of intro to what I was going to write if 
everyone liked this. Subsequent chapters will probably cover what 
conflicts will come from Kouga into this matter. Also send any comments, 
compliments, complaints, spam, lovemail, hatemail, and death threats.
