<h1>Make Decision!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../inuyasha/index.html">InuYasha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/spiralingfaith.html">Spiraling Faith</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kagome ran through the forest, her black hair flowed back while she ran.
Her brown eyes were full of tears. She was wearing her school outfit,
which she always wore when in the feudal era of Japan.  Over her back
hung the large, tan bag.  It carried her usual stuff, such as medicines,
drinks, bandages, and an extra uniform.  

After some time she made it to the well, her anticipated destination.
She stopped at the well, and threw her bag in.  Before she leapt in she
heard a voice. A voice that she was pleased her ear.  Sango&#146;s voice. She
turned and saw the woman that she claimed to love.  

Sango wore a white and red kimono.  Her black hair is down, and her face
looked angry. Her brown eyes were swollen, with unshed tears.  On top of
her eyes she is wearing pink mascara.  &quot;Kagome!&quot; she screamed, running
for Kagome. Then she pulled her into a tight embrace.  &quot;Kagome,&quot; she
sighed, relieved. 

&quot;Sango, what is wrong?&quot; Kagome asked, looking into her love&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I am tired of this,&quot; Sango stated, leaving Kagome in a state of
complete confusion.  She looked Kagome in the eyes, &quot;Every time you two
fight you leave, making me feel alone, and unloved.&quot;  &quot;Now choose, me or
him!&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t know,&quot; said Kagome, looking towards the ground.  Sango returned
her face to where she had to look her in the eyes.  &quot;Wait,&quot; said Kagome,
her face lighting up, &quot; I have an Idea!&quot;  

&quot;Really?&quot; asked Sango, bringing her index finger to her chin.  

&quot;I have two School outfits!&quot; Kagome exclaimed, grabbing Sango by the
hand.  &quot;If you leap in with me, I can take you to my time, there I can
make my decision,&quot; explained Kagome, steeping up on the side of the
well, &quot;and you won&#146;t feel alone and unloved.&quot;  Kagome looked back at
Sango, &quot;because you&#146;re not,&quot; she sighed, before leaping into the well.
Sango was pulled in with Kagome. 

The well glowed a bright purple as Kagome and Sango moved through time.
After leaving down into the bottom, they both appeared in the present,
at the bottom of the well.  

&quot;Put this on,&quot; Kagome commanded, handing Sango her extra uniform.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because, my family might get the wrong idea if you don&#146;t!&quot;

Sango relented and put on the uniform, which fit a little to tightly in
some places.  &quot;It&#39;s a little tight,&quot; she complained, looking down at the
uniform.  

&quot;No,&quot; the young woman laughs, poking at Sango&#146;s stomach.

&quot;If you say so.&quot; She and Kagome crawled out of the well and walked up to
the door.  &quot;Wait, what would the wrong idea be?&quot; asked the curious demon
slayer.

&quot;Well, what if I don&#146;t choose you?&quot;

&quot;You better choose me!&quot; 

With a sigh Kagome opened the door and led Sango inside.  Her mother,
grandfather, and Sota greet her and her friend.  &quot;Oh, who might this
be?&quot; asked her mother.

&quot;A friend from school who is gonna help me catch up on the work,&quot; Kagome
lied. &quot;Well, we&#146;re going up to my room, no one come in!&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; sighed her mother as she watched her daughter and friend ran up
the stairs.

&quot;Kagome...&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;
         
&quot;I hope you choose me.&quot;


Naraku&#146;s Castle:

Kagura wore her usual kimono and carried a fan as her weapon.  Her black
hair flew freely in the wind that she had created and her red eyes
burned with hatred for her opponent, whom she hated only half as much as
she hated her master, Naraku.

Her opponent had long silver hair that flowed down to his waist.  His
eyes were like cats&#39;, yellow and watching everything.  Wrapped around
his left hand is leather, quite a lot of leather, with a hook at the
end. &quot;Kagura, you hate Naraku more than I,&quot; he reasoned. &quot;Let me kill
him.&quot; 

&quot;If I let you pass and you fail, he will kill me.&quot;

At that he laughed loudly. &quot;Fine, I&#146;ll just kill you and then...&quot;
Without finishing his sentence he threw the hook hard in her direction.
Quickly she took to the air and let the hook fly through the wood-and-
cloth door.  The hook hit Naraku and finished him off easily.  After
being in his body for mere minutes, it exploded, reducing his castle to
nothing but rubble.  

Kagura floated down amazed at his power. &quot;You&#146;re now free from that
spell, and are your own demon,&quot; he states. &quot;But, can you do me a favor?&quot;

&quot;And what might that be?&quot;

&quot;Protect my sister,&quot; he stated. &quot;She is like you, in sexual desires.&quot;

&quot;Really? I might, then.&quot;


Kagome&#146;s:

Sota had been up until 7 a.m. after hearing some noises he didn&#146;t want
to hear.  The sounds of his sister and her &quot;friend&quot; doing something that
he felt he was to young to hear.  But there was no proof.  He waited
until noon for them to wake, and then he couldn&#146;t take it, and opened
the door.  Everything looked normal. Kagome was in her bed, asleep.  But
then he noticed Sango in the bed with her.  They were also in their
bras. Their bottom halves were covered.  Sota was speechless.  Suddenly
Kagome woke up.

She looked around, rubbing her eyes.  She didn&#146;t notice him until she
was done stretching.  &quot;Sota!&quot; she yelled, waking Sango, &quot;I said that no
one can come in!&quot;

Sota backed away from the door, but didn&#146;t leave Kagome&#39;s sight.
&quot;Sorry, but I heard you two, and I was wondering if you were all right,&quot;
Sota made up.

&quot;Told you that you were being too loud,&quot; laughed Sango in the middle of
her and her brother&#146;s argument.  

&quot;Sango,&quot; whined Kagome.  Finally she threw a pillow at Sota, who quickly
closed the door before it could hit him.  The pillow hit the door and
fell to the ground.  &quot;Sango, I think I have made my decision.&quot;

&quot;Really, who?&quot;

&quot;First I am going to tell my family.&quot;  Kagome looked at Sango with an
impish smile. &quot;You can find out there.&quot;


The kitchen:

Kagome walked in, holding Sango&#146;s hand tightly. &quot;Mom, Grandpa, Sota, I
have something to tell you all.&quot;

Her mother looked at her sternly.  &quot;We already know, Sota told us.&quot;

Kagome sighed loudly.  &quot;Okay, so, you know Sango is from the feudal era,
but I have something else to tell you guys.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so she is from the Feudal era,&quot; her grandfather laughed.

&quot;So you Sango is the only person who doesn&#146;t know my choice then.&quot;  She
looked Sango in the eyes deeply. Sango returned the gaze, &quot;I have chosen
you,&quot; Kagome barely breathed.

&quot;Really?&quot; asked an almost speechless Sango.

&quot;Yes.&quot;  Though Kagome was in front of her family, she couldn&#146;t help but
press her lips to Sango&#146;s.

Her mother cleared her throat.  Kagome and Sango stop, blushing from ear
to ear.  &quot;So, are you going back today?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kagome answered for the both of them.

&quot;Okay.&quot;  Her mother sipped her tea.  &quot;I am fine with this under one
condition.&quot;  &quot;No sex here. I can&#146;t stop you out there, but none here.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t worry ma&#39;am,&quot; Sango interrupted. &quot;We haven&#146;t had sex yet.&quot;


Feudal Japan:

&quot;You have done what!&quot; Inuyasha screamed.

&quot;I love Sango, and she loves me.  We are together.&quot;


Episode Two:

Hi Kagome here.  On the next episode Inuyasha still can&#39;t believe that I
chose Sango over him, but I don&#146;t care.  We finally make it to Naraku&#146;s
castle, but it is nothing but ruins.  Finally while we sleep Kagura and
a new demon named Teres show up.  But they seem to be friendly.  I don&#146;t
know.  Find out on the next episode:

Teres&#146; Touch
Also for you people reading this you get a special preview of an 
Original Fiction I will be sending into Shoujo-Ai soon. I will call it 
FAITH.

I search the world wondering why.

Why was my village attack those three years ago?

Why was my sister kidnaped from the village at that time?

Why do things leap out of my hand?

Why is the sign spreading across my body?

Why does this sword appear for me?

Why do my black wings appear?

And what are the &quot;Demon&quot;?

The only clue I have is that girl from four years ago. Some how she has 
the answer to my questions.  But it only gives me a new question.  Where 
is she?  I will search the world to find her.  The girl I met, yet do 
not know.
