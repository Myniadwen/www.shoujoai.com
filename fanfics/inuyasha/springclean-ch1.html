<h1>Spring Cleaning</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../inuyasha/index.html">InuYasha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/evileric.html">Evil Eric</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kagome moaned with pleasure as she lowered her hot, dirty body into the 
hot spring. It had been almost a week since the trail of Shikon shards 
had gone dry, and baka Inu-Yasha wouldn&#39;t hear of resting until the 
rest of the team had &quot;convinced&quot; him. And it had taken quite a few 
&quot;SIT!&quot;s to convince him. Sometimes Kagome swore the hanyou could only 
be reasonable when his head was buried under a foot of earth.

The heat did wonders for Kagome&#39;s aching joints and muscles. She&#39;d have 
to remember to do this more once she got back to her own time.

She floated back to the edge of the water and reached for her bag. As 
she was pulling some towels and wash rags out, there was a rustling in 
the bushes off to her left. Suddenly defensive, Kagome wrapped one of 
the towels around her wet chest and turned to face the intruder.

&quot;Who&#39;s there?!&quot; she demanded.

&quot;It&#39;s me, Sango!&quot; said a familiar voice belonging to a familiar demon 
huntress.

Kagome felt a sense of relief when the older girl came into view. She 
relaxed her death-grasp on the towel.

&quot;Oh, Sango-chan, thank the kami. I thought it might have been some kind 
of pervert.&quot;

&quot;I think I know what kind you mean,&quot; Sango said, rolling her eyes. &quot;Mind
if I join you? I&#39;m dying here.&quot;

Kagome nodded. As she walked back into the deeper water, she noticed 
Sango removing her clothes out of the corner of her eye. Kagome felt a 
pang of envy as she studied Sango&#39;s body. The slayer had a great 
physique, with firm muscles, great skin and breasts at least a size 
larger than Kagome&#39;s own. It made her feel soft by comparison.

Sango&#39;s splash as she stepped into the water snapped the time-traveling 
girl back to her senses, and fortunately, Sango hadn&#39;t noticed Kagome&#39;s 
staring at her.

&quot;Ohhhh, that&#39;s soooo relaxing...&quot; Sango droned, dipping her head under 
the water only to stand up and slick back her hair. To Kagome&#39;s sudden 
surprise, this action caused Sango to unconsciously thrust her chest 
forward, giving the younger girl a first-class view of her magnificent 
breasts, drenched in the hot water of the spring. Even as Kagome 
watched, Sango&#39;s nipples hardened as they came into contact with the 
cooler air. Sango opened her eyes again and saw Kagome staring wide-eyed
and slack-jawed at her. &quot;Kagome-sama? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kagome shook her head, blushing furiously. &quot;Um, nothing, Sango-
chan.&quot;

The demon huntress nodded, unsure, but didn&#39;t press the issue. Instead 
she left her feet and began floating face-up in the water. Using her 
hands, Sango gently splashed the water over her body, propelling herself
along with small kicks of her feet.

&quot;Mmmm...this makes up for that whole skunk demon incident the other 
day,&quot; Sango sighed. &quot;I swear, when we defeat Naraku and find all the 
mission shards of the Shikon no Tama, I&#39;m going to do this every day.&quot;

&quot;Um,&quot; was all Kagome could say in response. She was too busy staring at 
Sango&#39;s muscular stomach, shapely thighs, and the neatly trimmed patch 
of dark hair between the older girl&#39;s legs. Who knew how she kept it so 
neat with only Feudal Era grooming tools at her disposal? Kagome had no 
idea. All she knew was that the droplets of water clinging to Sango&#39;s 
pubic hair were utterly transfixing. When Sango shifted her legs to kick
harder through the water, Kagome was treated to a brief glimpse of the 
older girl&#39;s womanhood.

Feeling a tingling between her own legs, Kagome was struck by a sudden 
sense of immediacy. Whatever she was going to do next, she had to do it 
right away. And the only things she could think of to do were to jump on
top of the demon slayer and ravish her right then and there, or to throw
her clothes on and run for dear life. Half the muscles in her body were 
ready to exercise that first option, when suddenly she realized exactly 
what she was thinking about doing.

&#39;What am I thinking?&#39; she thought. &#39;I can&#39;t do that with Sango-chan...it
wouldn&#39;t be right. Besides, I like Inu-sama, don&#39;t I?&#39;

&quot;Kagome-sama, could you help me for a minute? I can&#39;t reach my back by
 myself,&quot; Sango said.

The feeling in Kagome&#39;s nether regions intensified, and she suddenly 
lost her nerve. She dashed for the stone steps leading out of the hot 
spring, wrapping a white towel around her as she stepped out. She 
started digging in her bag for her clothes like the skunk demons were 
after her again.

&quot;I-I...that is, I mean I-I-I uh...I gotta get back to the group!&quot; Kagome
stammered, flinging on one of her bras and fumbling unsuccessfully with 
the clasp. She didn&#39;t realize she&#39;d taken both hands off her towel until
it fell to the ground, exposing her entire lower body. She let out a 
small &quot;eep!&quot; as she shifted her arms and legs to conceal her private 
parts. One of her bra straps slid down her shoulder, causing a soft, 
pale breast to pop free.

Sango returned to her feet and stood up, once again giving the would-be-
miko a perfect view of her chest. An amused look crossed her face.

&quot;Kagome-sama...aren&#39;t you a little tense? We&#39;ve seen each other&#39;s bodies
many times.&quot;

Kagome realized the truth of the older girl&#39;s words, and resumed her 
normal stance. She was still blushing all over. After all, it felt weird
to be standing there in nothing but her bra--which was still hanging 
askew--but Sango was right. They had seen enough of each other to not 
have anything to hide, and they were the only ones there.

&quot;Gomen, Sango-chan,&quot; Kagome said. &quot;You&#39;re right, I just...something&#39;s 
different and I don&#39;t know what.&quot;

Sango stepped out of the water and took Kagome&#39;s hands. Stepping 
backward, she led the younger girl back into the hot liquid. Kagome felt
her heartbeat skyrocket as Sango intertwined their fingers.

&quot;I know what it is,&quot; Sango said. &quot;You realized something.&quot; She drew 
Kagome closer and closer, until their breasts touched. Kagome could feel
Sango&#39;s hardened nipples poking into the flesh of her exposed breast and
the fabric of her covered one.

&quot;You&#39;re attracted to me, aren&#39;t you, Kagome-sama?&quot; Sango whispered in 
the younger girl&#39;s ear.

&quot;No, I--mmph!&quot;

Kagome&#39;s half-hearted denial was interrupted by a powerful kiss. Sango&#39;s
lips were locked against her own, pressing and caressing passionately. 
The demon slayer&#39;s tongue slipped into the sweetness of Kagome&#39;s mouth, 
licking everything it could reach. A shocked Kagome kissed back, 
relishing the taste of Sango&#39;s tongue and the softness of her lips. The
 kiss continued for several moments, and Kagome was unable to think 
about anything else until she felt Sango begin to press her breasts 
harder into her own, and one of Sango&#39;s legs slipping between hers.

Kagome moaned loudly into Sango&#39;s mouth as the older girl began to rub 
her thigh against Kagome&#39;s petals, and a pair of strong arms wrap around
her body. One of Sango&#39;s hands caressed the small of Kagome&#39;s back, 
while the other reached down to give her rear a gentle squeeze. She felt
her clitoris begin to peek out of its hood, only to be brushed back and 
forth by Sango&#39;s thrusting thigh. She screamed around the slayer&#39;s 
tongue, as flashes of fire and ice rocked her body.

To the miko, whose sexual experiences up to this point were limited to 
pleasuring herself, this was far better, far more intense than anything 
she could imagine. She had always thought her first time with another 
would have been with a boy--most likely with Inu-Yasha or perhaps Hojo--
but strangely, she found that she didn&#39;t mind that it turned out to be 
with Sango-chan. In fact, it might even have been better that way. Sango
was using her whole body on to pleasure Kagome&#39;s whole body: the sweet 
tongue in her mouth, the firm, luscious breasts rubbing against her 
tender chest, the hands roaming her lower body, the smooth leg rubbing 
against her womanhood...even without the water of the hot spring, Kagome
felt like she was floating. She&#39;d never dreamed someone could make love 
to her so completely!

Kagome felt a powerful feeling building in her loins, a feeling that 
needed release desperately. Almost as if Sango could read her mind, the 
two of them opened their eyes at the same time. Kagome saw a look of 
mischievous, passionate love in Sango&#39;s eyes, and somehow she just felt 
that Sango knew what she needed. Kagome pushed her tongue into Sango&#39;s 
mouth and thrust her breasts forward as if to say, &#39;Give me more. Give 
me more!&#39;

Sango obliged, surprising the younger girl by biting down gently on her 
tongue, and at the same time strengthening her grasp on Kagome&#39;s ass. 
The shock of this stronger contact pushed Kagome over the edge, and a 
powerful orgasm rocked her body. She felt her strength leave her, 
overwhelmed by sensations she wasn&#39;t used to. Sango leaned backward and 
the two of them fell with a splash into the water, Kagome&#39;s head coming 
to a rest on Sango&#39;s firm breasts.

The miko wasn&#39;t sure how long they just lay there, floating, and 
enjoying the feeling of Sango&#39;s fingers running through the wet locks of
her hair. When she found herself able to speak again, Kagome looked up 
to behold a serene expression on her lover&#39;s face.

&quot;Sango-chan...&quot;

&quot;Shhh, just relax, Kagome-sama...&quot;

&quot;...Arigatou, Sango-chan.&quot;

Sango planted a soft kiss on Kagome&#39;s forehead, and Kagome giggled. She 
returned the kiss on the closest thing she could reach, which turned out
to be Sango&#39;s coral-colored nipple.

&quot;Why did you, um...why did we...do that?&quot; Kagome asked.

Sango smiled. &quot;Ever since I found out the truth about all of you and 
Naraku, about who really destroyed my village, I&#39;ve been devoted to our 
cause of defeating him. But since then, I&#39;ve also become devoted to all 
of you...especially you, Kagome-sama. Your quest requires a lot from 
you, and I am willing to help you in whatever way I can. There&#39;s nothing
I wouldn&#39;t do for you. In a way, I guess you could say...I love you, 
Kagome-sama.&quot;

Kagome didn&#39;t know what to say, but she managed to sputter, &quot;But...what 
about Miroku-sama?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes I love him, too,&quot; Sango said. &quot;And other times I hate him. 
But when I do love him, it&#39;s not quite the same as the way I love you. I
can love both of you at once. Just like I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t feel the same
way about Inu-Yasha and myself.&quot;

&quot;Um, I guess...&quot; Then Kagome was struck by a thought. &quot;You&#39;ve done this 
with another woman before, haven&#39;t you, Sango-chan?&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; Sango nodded. &quot;Back at my village, I once had another lover. Her 
name was Kimiko, and she was the only other female demon huntress 
besides myself. The two of us...well, we were just friends at first, but
then we became rivals, and finally lovers. Under the moonlit sky, we 
spent many nights teaching each other how to make love to a woman.&quot;

Kagome blushed, trying to picture this in her mind. &quot;That must have been
wonderful, Sango-chan...what happened to Kimiko?&quot;

&quot;She died with the rest of my village when Naraku attacked. That was...
one of the reasons why I was so furious at those who had done it.&quot;

&quot;Oh...gomen nasai, Sango-chan.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;

They drifted in silence for another few minutes. After a while, Kagome 
felt one of Sango&#39;s hands reach up and brush her breast. That was when 
she noticed she still had that bra half-on and half-off. The straps from
the side of her exposed breast were floating limply in the hot water. 
She knew it would probably be wrinkled when it dried off, but for some 
reason she wasn&#39;t very concerned about that. Sango gave the breast still
covered in a bra cup a little squeeze, and began running her fingers 
curiously over the soft fabric.

&quot;Kagome-sama, what is that thing you&#39;re wearing?&quot; Sango asked.

&quot;This? It&#39;s a bra. Um, a brassiere. In the 21st century, it&#39;s a kind of 
underwear women wear to keep their breasts from sagging.&quot;

The slayer seemed impressed. &quot;That&#39;s a good idea! I wish we had those 
kinds of things in our time.&quot;

&quot;Well, you could try out one of mine,&quot; Kagome suggested naughtily. Sango
picked up the dangling end of Kagome&#39;s bra, a few drips of water flying 
off it. &quot;Not that one. Let me get you a dry one.&quot;

Kagome slipped out of Sango&#39;s warm embrace and pulled herself to her 
feet. She sloshed over to where she had left her bag and started 
rummaging in it again. It was a good thing she&#39;d packed several days&#39; 
worth of clothes! Then, as she shoved a green school skirt aside, she 
found the perfect thing. It was a special bra from an American lingerie 
company...V-something&#39;s Secret, it was called. It was a lot more 
expensive than the rest of her underwear, and it&#39;d had to be special-
ordered. But it was just right, since it was a little loose around her, 
and Sango&#39;s breasts were larger than hers. Plus, it didn&#39;t hurt that it 
latched from the front. Kagome snickered evilly.

&quot;Oh, Sango-chan...&quot;

Sango got to her feet again and stood up, looking on with curiosity as 
Kagome climbed back in the water, carrying some lacy pink thing that 
looked kind of like the one she was wearing. Kagome seemed to remember 
the one she still had draped over one shoulder, and casually pulled it 
off and tossed it over her shoulder. Kagome swam back over to her, 
carefully keeping the bra above the water, and handed it to her.

&quot;Um...what do I do with it?&quot; Sango asked.

&quot;You put it on, of course!&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;Oh, let me...&quot;

Kagome motioned for Sango to put her arms through the straps and pulled 
it tight across her back. Not shy at all by now, Kagome took hold of 
Sango&#39;s breasts and fit them into the bra cups. Sango blushed at the 
contact. The bra was a tight fit around Sango&#39;s large chest, but Kagome 
was able to fasten the bra with little trouble.

&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Kagome asked.

&quot;It&#39;s...a little tight,&quot; Sango said. &quot;It&#39;s squeezing my breasts.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I thought it would. You need a bigger size. Heh-heh.&quot;

&quot;Do all women in the 21st century wear these?&quot;

&quot;Umm...almost all of them. But that one&#39;s special. It comes from 
America.&quot; Kagome smirked, feeling important.

&quot;America...that place on the Western continent, where they speak that 
language in that one book you always bring with you?&quot;

&quot;Mmm.&quot;

&quot;I see. Um, Kagome-sama...can I take it off now? It&#39;s starting to hurt.&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh, of course. No, wait. Let me do it...&quot;

Kagome unfastened the catch on the bra, allowing Sango&#39;s breasts to 
bounce free. The motion started to get Kagome excited again, and she 
acted on a sudden impulse. She took hold of one of Sango&#39;s breasts with 
both hands, and pressed her lips to it.

&quot;I--oh! Kagome-sama!&quot; Sango cried.

Kagome began to suckle Sango&#39;s breast with vigor, pulling on it with her
lips and running her tongue over the areolae. She let one of her hands 
drift over to Sango&#39;s other breast, and caressed both of them in a slow 
rhythm. Meanwhile she continued to suck on one nipple, occasionally 
nibbling on it with her teeth and planting a kiss on the underside of 
the breast. Sango nearly lost her balance and fell into the water, but 
caught herself at the last second.

&quot;Careful, Sango-chan,&quot; Kagome said, letting up from her suckling. &quot;We 
can&#39;t let that bra get wet. Here, why don&#39;t we take this over to the 
edge of the spring...&quot;

Sango nodded, and picked Kagome up into her arms. Kagome giggled and 
latched her mouth onto Sango&#39;s other breast, nursing like a happy baby. 
Sango carried Kagome over to the edge of the spring and leaned up 
against the rocks, carefully prying the pink bra off herself and placing
it on the dry ground.

With that taken care of, Kagome eagerly resumed her ministrations. She 
planted wet kisses and trailed her tongue over every inch of Sango&#39;s 
other breast, all the while pinching the nipple she had been sucking 
moments earlier. Sango&#39;s breathing intensified, and her chest heaved 
with every breath. For someone who had never made love to another woman 
before, Kagome was strangely good at it. The younger girl&#39;s fingers and 
lips seemed to be all over her at once.

&quot;Oh, kami-sama...Kagome-sama! Mmmm!&quot; Sango felt her foot slide on a 
slippery rock. &quot;Wait, wait...let&#39;s get out of the water, Kagome-sama.&quot;

Kagome nodded, and the two girls pulled themselves onto the rocks that 
formed the edge of the hot spring. Sango lay down on her back, her 
marvelous breasts ready for more attention.

&quot;I have to repay you for what you did for me, Sango-chan,&quot; Kagome 
whispered, positioning herself above the demon huntress. &quot;Just lie back 
and enjoy.&quot;

Kagome leaned down to Sango&#39;s face, teasing her with an almost-kiss 
before slipping her tongue into the slayer&#39;s ear. Sango gasped at the 
unexpected contact. She cried out when Kagome began nibbling on her 
earlobe, one of the miko&#39;s hands reaching down to continue pleasuring 
her breasts. Sango almost wasn&#39;t ready when Kagome kissed her again. The
younger girl&#39;s tongue thrust back into her mouth, teasing her and 
running over her smooth teeth. But the kiss was only a warm-up.

&quot;Your breasts are incredible, Sango-chan...&quot;

Kagome brushed Sango&#39;s breasts with her own, rubbing their hard nipples 
together and poking the tender skin. She took her own breasts in her 
hand and pressed them hard against Sango&#39;s, this time without that pesky
bra to get in the way.

&quot;Mmm, so incredible...&quot;

&quot;Yours aren&#39;t too--ahh!!--bad either!&quot;

Kagome squeezed both pairs of breasts together, kneading them roughly. 
Sango moaned loudly, and for good measure Kagome trailed her tongue up 
Sango&#39;s neck. The feeling of their nipples digging into those tender 
orbs of flesh was electrifying. But the miko wanted another taste of 
them. She released Sango&#39;s breasts, and spread them apart so she could 
lick up and down the valley between them. She nuzzled and kissed each 
one, then pressed them together hard. Sango&#39;s nipples were almost 
touching, and Kagome lowered her mouth to them, sucking on both at the 
same time.

Sango&#39;s breasts felt like they were on fire! She had to work hard to 
fight down screams, but no one had ever done to her what Kagome was 
doing, not even her former lover. She hadn&#39;t thought it possible, but 
Kagome was going to make her come only by touching her breasts!

&quot;Ahh! Kagome-sama! I&#39;m going to...!&quot;

Sango felt her loins clench and her fluids gush out, soaking her legs. 
Kagome mercifully released her breasts, giving her precious seconds to 
catch her breath. Her chest was heaving so hard she could barely see 
over it. There were no words to describe what she had just felt.

Then she felt a pair of fingers playing around near her mound. She 
leaned her head up and saw Kagome pop those fingers into her mouth. The 
younger girl smiled.

&quot;You taste so sweet, Sango-chan!&quot; Kagome said. &quot;You have to try it.&quot;

Sango already knew what her love honey tasted like, having tried it by 
herself and when she had been with Kimiko. But she decided to humor the 
other girl. When the fingers returned, Sango opened her mouth and sucked
hard on them. All too soon, however, Kagome pulled them out.

&quot;Wait, I have a better idea,&quot; Kagome said.

She positioned herself so she was sitting on Sango&#39;s legs, and began to 
trace her tongue down Sango&#39;s muscular stomach, letting her tongue 
swirl around in the demon huntress&#39; belly button before moving down to 
the wet folds of Sango&#39;s womanhood. Kagome licked her lips for a moment,
then ran her tongue up the length of Sango&#39;s slit. The demon slayer 
screamed in pleasure and would have kicked Kagome if she hadn&#39;t been 
holding her legs down. Kagome kissed Sango&#39;s cute little nub to coax it 
out of its hiding place, and then slowly licked in a circle around it. 
Sango&#39;s whole body was spasming and she was clawing at her own breasts. 
Kagome lowered her head and slipped her tongue into Sango&#39;s vagina. She 
licked as far inside Sango as she could reach, sucking up the demon 
slayer&#39;s love juices. As Sango began to heave and writhe, Kagome 
increased her tempo, thrusting her tongue hard into Sango&#39;s entrance. 
She felt Sango grab her head, trying to pull Kagome even farther inside 
herself. The miko responded with a series of super-fast licks, 
fluttering her tongue around inside the wet hole.

Kagome pulled her tongue out momentarily, and started to nibble on 
Sango&#39;s petals. She used her lips, tongue and teeth on the older girl&#39;s 
sensitive entrance, drawing even more moans from Sango. She moved back 
up, planting a kiss on Sango&#39;s wet patch of hair before attaching her 
lips to Sango&#39;s clit again. She replaced her tongue with two fingers 
inside Sango, thrusting them in and out rapidly, while tugging on 
Sango&#39;s clit with her lips.

Kagome had a feeling Sango was about to come again.

&quot;I&#39;m about to come again, Kagome-sama!&quot;

Then she was sure of it.

With a sudden inspiration, Kagome removed her fingers from Sango&#39;s sex 
and pressed her breasts together. She gave Sango&#39;s clit a last, hard 
suck, and the demon slayer arched her back and screamed Kagome&#39;s name. 
Sango&#39;s juices squirted out, drenching Kagome&#39;s breasts, and she 
collapsed back to the ground. Kagome took hold of one of her own breasts
and rubbed it up and down Sango&#39;s slit, using her nipple to scrape the 
come off, and letting it linger near her clit. She moved over to Sango&#39;s
face, covered in sweat and blushing furiously. She offered Sango her 
breasts, covered in the slayer&#39;s own come, which she eagerly began to 
suckle and lick.

Kagome gave Sango a naughty smile, which Sango returned. It seemed dirty
to be licking her own juices off Kagome&#39;s breasts, but that just made 
her want to do it more. A small glob began sliding down Kagome&#39;s left 
nipple, which Sango promptly fastened her lips around. Remembering the 
extensive treatment Kagome had given her, Sango let her lips linger on 
Kagome&#39;s nipple a little longer, then returned to licking all over the 
pale skin. When at last she&#39;d gotten the younger girl&#39;s soft orbs clean,
they pressed their lips together, both tasting Sango.

&quot;I want to try that now,&quot; Kagome whispered in Sango&#39;s ear.

Before Sango could say anything in response, Kagome straddled her face, 
letting her dripping sex hang inches from Sango&#39;s mouth. Sango took the 
hint, leaning forward to clamp her mouth onto Kagome&#39;s crotch. She moved
her hands to the younger girl&#39;s thighs to steady her, and thrust her 
tongue deep inside.

&quot;Mmmm!&quot; Kagome moaned. &quot;Lick me hard, Sango-chan! Make me come!&quot;

Sango devoured Kagome&#39;s womanhood, finding the taste even better than 
her own. She licked up every drop of moisture she could find, sucking 
and caressing Kagome&#39;s delicious folds. Kagome almost fell over 
backward, throwing her arms out to catch herself as Sango continued to 
ravage her. The other girl&#39;s tongue was an intense experience, far 
exceeding what she could do with her own fingers. Her hips bucked as 
Sango continued to eat her out, forcing her tongue farther into Kagome 
than she thought it could go. And just as she thought she couldn&#39;t take 
anymore, Sango pulled out and started applying short, fast licks to her 
clitoris. Marveling at how Sango could give her this much pleasure from 
such a tiny organ, she felt a now-familiar feeling begin to build up 
inside herself. It was the same feeling Sango had made her feel earlier,
but this time it was coming on even stronger.

&quot;Oh, kami-sama! Lick me harder, Sango-chan!&quot;

&quot;Kagome-sama! I love you!&quot;

It wasn&#39;t long before Kagome came again. At the last second, she pulled 
off of Sango&#39;s mouth and positioned herself above Sango&#39;s breasts. She 
felt herself gushing, covering Sango&#39;s chest with her cream. As her 
orgasm wore off, Kagome&#39;s breathing returned to normal, and she used a 
hand to wipe the cream from herself and spreading it on Sango&#39;s chest.

&quot;Kagome-sama...&quot; Sango whispered.

Kagome planted a kiss on Sango&#39;s forehead in response, then returned 
her attention to Sango&#39;s breasts.

She licked her come from Sango&#39;s breasts slowly, tracing her tongue in
small spirals and occasionally giving the nipples brief licks. She had
to admit, her own juices tasted pretty good, although that might have
had something to do with where she was licking them from. She took her
time cleaning Sango&#39;s mounds, greatly enjoying the task.

When she was finally done, she collapsed on top of the older girl, their
naked bodies gently touching each other. Sango held Kagome with one hand
and stroked her hair with the other. They lay like that for a long time,
until Sango worked up the energy to say something else.

&quot;Kagome-sama,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to make love to you like I used to make
love to Kimiko...&quot;

Kagome looked up, somewhat shocked that Sango would say something like 
that. &quot;A-are you sure, Sango-chan? I mean, if you two had a special way 
to do it, would it be right for you to do it with me? I don&#39;t want to 
intrude or anything...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Kagome-sama. Kimiko taught me how to do it this way in 
hopes that I would be able to share it with many loves I would have in 
the future. Please, let me make love to you...&quot;

The miko thought for a moment. If Sango didn&#39;t call what they were doing
before making love, but she did call this making love, what could it 
possibly be like? It was too tempting.

&quot;OK, Sango-chan. Make love to me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I wanted to hear!&quot;

With a start, Sango flipped the two of them over so that she was on top 
of Kagome. Kissing the younger girl quickly, she grabbed Kagome&#39;s legs 
and spread them. Then she straddled Kagome&#39;s pelvis so that their clits 
were touching, and wrapped her own legs around Kagome&#39;s. This minimal 
contact alone was enough to make Kagome draw in a sharp breath, but when
Sango started thrusting her hips into Kagome&#39;s, the world began to spin.

&quot;Match your thrusts with mine, Kagome-sama!&quot;

&quot;Hai, Sango-chan!&quot;

They crushed their sexes together, rubbing and grinding hard against 
each other. Sango was right; this was way beyond anything they had done 
until now. Their lower lips were pressed against each other, forming a 
kiss far more intimate than the regular kind. Both girls rocked their 
hips together, making love in a furious frenzy.

&quot;Kagome-samaaaa!&quot;

&quot;Sango-chaaaan!&quot;

Powerful sensations rocked both girls&#39; bodies as they came at the same 
time, coating each other with a mixture of their juices. Finally 
exhausted, they came to rest on the smooth stone, held close in each 
other&#39;s arms and sharing occasional kisses.

&quot;Sango-chan, that was unbelievable! I&#39;ve never felt anything like that 
before...&quot;

&quot;I told you you&#39;d like it, Kagome-sama,&quot; Sango said with a wink.

&quot;Mmm. But now we&#39;re all sweaty and covered in...um, you know...what do 
we do now?&quot;

&quot;Well, we ARE right by a hot spring. Once we can move again, I suggest 
we go back in.&quot;

&quot;Heh-heh, oh yeah. I forgot. That sounds like a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

Then something occurred to Kagome. She sat up as much as she could, and 
looked around her. She didn&#39;t see what she was looking for. Sango looked
up, curious.

&quot;What is it, Kagome-sama?&quot;

&quot;Sango-chan, what happened to my bra?&quot;

&quot;Um...I don&#39;t know. I left it right here.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not here now.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying? That somebody came and took it?&quot;

&quot;Of course not, Sango-chan. If somebody had come over here, we would 
have noticed them.&quot;

&quot;Oh...I guess we would have.&quot;

Inu-Yasha was lying on a low-hanging but strong tree branch, using his 
reflection in Tetsusaiga&#39;s blade to help sharpen his fangs. He wasn&#39;t 
in the best of moods. Well, he was rarely in a good mood, but now he 
was in an even worse mood than usual. He hadn&#39;t wanted to be here, but 
he hadn&#39;t been given a choice, and now he had nothing to do. The dog 
demon hated that. He would have even preferred the skunk demons to this.
That was just his thing: he preferred pain to boredom.

&quot;Feh...stupid wench, making me sit around while she takes a bath,&quot; he 
muttered to himself. &quot;If I didn&#39;t need her to help find the Shikon 
shards, I&#39;d just ditch her and let her get eaten by the next hungry 
youkai that passes by.&quot;

He sighed and went back to picking his teeth, when he suddenly heard a 
rustling sound from the bushes ahead of him. He hopped off the branch 
and dropped into a fighting stance, prepared to cut any possible threat 
into confetti.

&quot;Grrr...show yourself!&quot; Inu-Yasha shouted. No response, just more 
rustling. &quot;I said get out here!&quot;

The thing did show itself that time, and it turned out to be nothing 
more than the local lecherous monk, Miroku.

&quot;Geez, Miroku, ya could have warned me it was just you,&quot; Inu-Yasha said,
sheathing his sword. Then he noticed there was something different about
the monk. His eyes were wide-open, his nose was bleeding, and his jaw 
was agape. He kind of looked like he&#39;d gotten his ass kicked by someone
...or something. &quot;What in the seven hells happened to you?&quot;

&quot;I...I...I...&quot; Miroku stuttered.

&quot;Spit it out!&quot; yelled the impatient hanyou.

Miroku shook his head, adopting an only slightly less-stupid look. &quot;Inu-
Yasha. Buddha has smiled upon me today! For today I have witnessed the 
most beautiful thing in all the world!&quot;

&quot;What the hell are you babbling about?&quot;

Miroku stuck out his hand. Inu-Yasha saw that he was holding some kind 
of weird pink thing, like a pair of cups with straps sticking out of 
them.

&quot;So, what&#39;s that thing?&quot; Inu-Yasha asked. &quot;What happened to you, 
Miroku?&quot;

&quot;It didn&#39;t happen TO me exactly...&quot; Miroku said. &quot;But I did SEE it, and 
that&#39;s what&#39;s important. That, and that I have this to remember it by.&quot;

The monk then walked away. Well, not exactly walked. The way he left 
was more like floating than anything else. Inu-Yasha just scratched his 
head and blew it off with a &quot;feh!&quot;

He climbed back onto his tree branch and tried to get some sleep. His 
ignorance of exactly what had just happened, and what was happening 
elsewhere, wouldn&#39;t last for long. And, in the months and years that 
followed, he would often wish he could have that ignorance back.

End.

Author&#39;s Notes:
I got to asking myself, &quot;Hey, Evil E...did they have lingerie back in 
the Japanese Feudal Era?&quot; And I got to answering myself, &quot;No, Evil E...I
don&#39;t think they did.&quot; What followed is what you just read. This is 
pure, unadulterated horse shit I scraped off the underside of my 
writing gland. It was supposed to be a half-page ecchi omake, but ended 
up being a full-blown, 13-page yuri lemon. But that&#39;s OK. There&#39;s not 
enough Sangome stuff out there anyway. If nobody else wants to write it,
I will, and I&#39;ll make it suck less than it could conceivably suck if it 
was written by somebody else. If you can&#39;t take the heat, get out of the
seat.</pre>
