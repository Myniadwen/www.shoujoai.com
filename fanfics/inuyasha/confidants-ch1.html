<h1>Confidants</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../inuyasha/index.html">InuYasha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ever since Sango and Kirara had joined Inuyasha, Kagome, Shippo, and 
Miroku in the search for the Sacred Jewel Shards, Kirara had always 
shared a special relationship with the young fox-demon, Shippo. The only 
full-blooded demons in their group, Shippo and Kirara were willing to 
share many aspects of their lives with each other. They would frequently 
talk among themselves when they were not needed in battle. 

Despite beliefs among the other members of the group that Shippo and 
Kirara were boyfriend and girlfriend, the truth was very different. 
Shippo felt that Kirara was far too old for him, and Kirara simply did 
not like Shippo in that way. The two demons were, however, very close 
friends and confidants. 

Most of their time spent traveling the Japanese countryside, the group 
usually did not have beds to sleep on, and so usually camped out around 
a fire that they made. The way that Kirara and Sango slept varied from 
night to night. Sometimes, Kirara would take on her large, saber-toothed 
form and acted as a pillow for Sango&#39;s head. Sometimes, Kirara chose to 
stay in her cute, small, kitten-like form and would curl up next to 
Sango. 

It was one of those nights that Kirara slept in her smaller form. Kagome 
was in her sleeping bag with Shippo tucked in next to her. Miroku was 
next to Sango, opposite Kirara. Inuyasha sat up against a tree, 
appearing meditative as he always did when he slept, his dog-like ears 
still at attention, even thought he was not conscious. 

Sango shifted in her sleep, causing Kirara to awaken. The small 
cat-demon looked up at Sango&#39;s sleeping form. Kirara had been in Sango&#39;s 
family for generations, but had never had a human friend as close as 
Sango. The young demon-slayer was strong and gracefull in battle, but 
was capable of so much kindness when she was not donned in her 
skin-tight, demon-slayer outfit. Kirara loved every moment that she was 
with Sango. She thought that Sango looked so beautiful as she slept. 

Kirara emitted a small mew before curling up against Sango&#39;s body again. 
&quot;Kirara?&quot; a small voice whispered from Kagome&#39;s direction. The 
cat-demon&#39;s ears twitched as she listened for who it was that had spoken 
to her. Kirara looked in the direction of the voice to find that Shippo 
had awoken. &quot;Is something wrong, Kirara?&quot; asked Shippo. 

Leaving the rest of the group for the time being, Shippo and Kirara 
wandered to a small river to talk in private like they occasionally did 
during the night. The two small demons looked out across the river, 
admiring the light of the full moon shimmering in the water. &quot;You&#39;ve 
seemed kind of preoccupied lately,&quot; Shippo said to Kirara. 

&quot;I know,&quot; said Kirara in a feline tongue that only other demons such as 
Shippo could understand. &quot;Ever since I met up with Kohaku the other day, 
I&#39;ve felt...&quot; Kiara trailed off, thinking of the right word to describe 
what she felt. The best to describe it was, &quot;...confused.&quot; 

&quot;Confused about what?&quot; asked Shippo. 

&quot;Well, when Kohaku saved me from those demons,&quot; Kirara explained, &quot;I was 
reminded of the times that we used to share together, me, Kohaku, and 
Sango. I thought about Sango and how much fun we had together with 
Kohaku. Sango has never been that happy since before Naraku took Kohaku. 
On that day, after Kohaku left, I wanted to see Sango smile like she did 
before our dealings with Naraku.&quot; 

&quot;You really care a lot for Sango, don&#39;t you, Kirara?&quot; Shippo asked. 

&quot;I do,&quot; said Kirara, her voice rife with longing. &quot;I&#39;m closer to Sango 
than I am to any other human. In all my years fighting beside the 
demon-slayers, I&#39;ve never met another human as powerful, as gracefull, 
as beautiful as Sango.&quot; 

Shippo looked at Kirara in awe, almost unable to believe what he was 
hearing. &quot;Kirara,&quot; he asked, &quot;are you in love with Sango?&quot; 

&quot;Yes!&quot; Kirara mewled. &quot;I&#39;m completely and utterly in love with Sango!&quot; 
Kirara rushed to Shippo and cried into the fox-demon&#39;s chest. She would 
have never shown this kind of emotion in front of Sango. Admiring the 
young demon-slayer as she did, Kirara never wanted Sango to worry about 
her. 

Shippo held the cat-demon in his arms, stroking Kirara&#39;s fur, comforting 
her as best he could. After Kirara&#39;s heavyhearted sobs had died down a 
little, Shippo asked, &quot;How long have you known you&#39;ve had these feelings 
for Sango?&quot; 

&quot;I suppose for as long as I&#39;ve known her,&quot; Kirara said to her confidant. 
&quot;It hadn&#39;t really crossed my mind after we met up with you and Inuyasha, 
but the memories that came back to me when I fought by Kohaku&#39;s side 
brought those feelings back up to the surface.&quot; Kirara turned away from 
Shippo and looked up at the moon again. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt such love for 
anyone else except...&quot; the cat-demon trailed off. 

&quot;Except...?&quot; Shippo asked. 

&quot;...except for Midoriko,&quot; Kirara finished. 

&quot;Priestess Midoriko?&quot; asked the fox-demon. &quot;The priestess that created 
the Shikon Jewel?&quot; 

&quot;Yes. That&#39;s her,&quot; Kirara replied. &quot;I fought alongside Midoriko while 
she was still alive, in much the same way I fight alongside Sango today. 
I would transform into my larger form, Midoriko would climb onto my 
back, and we would slay the demons that terrorized the country.&quot; 

&quot;She was like a demon-slayer,&quot; Shippo realized, &quot;but she used magic 
instead of weapons like Sango and Kohaku use.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s right. I was so heartbroken when Midoriko died. The time that we 
shared together was so precious to both of us.&quot; 

&quot;Did Midoriko return your feelings?&quot; asked Shippo. 

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Kirara. &quot;Midoriko was the only person who had ever 
returned my feelings of love. As soon as I confessed my feelings to her, 
she gratefully jumped into my arms and told me that she felt the same 
way about me that I did about her. I was so happy.&quot; 

At that point, Shippo was very confused about what Kirara was telling 
him. &quot;Jumped into your arms? How could she do that with a cat?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m a nekomata,&quot; said Kirara. &quot;As a nekomata, I do have a humanoid 
form. Midoriko is the only person I&#39;ve ever shown that form to. Nobody 
else, not the demon-slayers, not even Sango knows that I can take on 
that form. It was the only way that I could be with Midoriko completely 
and fully. The only way that I could tell her how I felt.&quot; Kirara paused 
before she spoke her next word. &quot;The only way that we could consummate 
our love.&quot; 

&quot;Why haven&#39;t you shown anyone else your humanoid form?&quot; asked a very 
intrigued Shippo. 

&quot;When Midoriko died, I was so heartbroken that I didn&#39;t want to fall in 
love again. And so, I hid my humanoid form from everybody so that nobody 
would know that I could take on a form that they could fall in love 
with.&quot; 

&quot;Hiding your true self only hurts you more than you already are,&quot; said 
the fox-demon. 

&quot;I know,&quot; said Kirara. &quot;I hoped that I could show Sango my humanoid form 
one day, that I could confess my feelings to her, that I could be with 
her like I was with Midoriko.&quot; 

&quot;You should tell her,&quot; Shippo said. &quot;If you&#39;ve loved Sango for so long, 
it&#39;s something that you should get off your chest.&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t now,&quot; Kirara said, obviously pained. &quot;Sango is dedicated to 
finding Kohaku. Until that changes, all I can be to her is a friend and 
a loyal partner. Besides, she&#39;s in love with Miroku. And he&#39;s in love 
with her. If I confessed my feelings for her right now, it would be too 
awkward, for both me and her.&quot; 

&quot;Well you have to tell her someday,&quot; Shippo said. 

&quot;I know,&quot; said Kirara. &quot;I will. As soon as I know she&#39;s ready to accept 
my feelings.&quot; Kirara was surprised then by the amount of confidence that 
had suddenly appeared inside her. She smiled at her confidant and said, 
&quot;Thank you Shippo for listening to what I had to say. I feel a lot 
better now that I&#39;ve talked to you about this.&quot; 

&quot;Any time,&quot; said Shippo with a wink. 

&quot;We should probably get some sleep,&quot; the nekomata said. &quot;We have another 
day of journeying tomorrow.&quot; 

Kirara started on her way back toward the campsite when Shippo said, 
&quot;Wait.&quot; The cat-demon looked back at Shippo with an inquiring look. 
&quot;Would you mind showing me your humanoid form? I&#39;d love to see what it 
looks like.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Kirara. &quot;I&#39;m kind of nervous. I haven&#39;t shown this 
form to anyone for hundreds of years.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t be nervous,&quot; the fox-demon reassured. &quot;I&#39;m sure you look 
beautiful.&quot; 

Kirara hesitated for a moment. Eventually, she turned toward Shippo and 
looked directly at him. She closed her eyes and her golden fur started 
to flare up, as if blown upward by a gust of wind. Her body grew larger, 
she started to stand upright, her face grew shorter, her irises 
contracted, the hair on her head grew longer, and the rest of her fur 
transformed into a flowing kimono, colored gold with small, black 
stripes knitted into it. Kirara had transformed into a beautiful, 
humanoid woman, about twenty years of age in demon years. Aside from her 
human characteristics, the nekomata retained her black, pointed ears, 
her parted upper lip, the slitted pupils, the black diamond-shaped mark 
on her forehead, and her two long, bushy tails. 

Shippo was in awe of the tall woman that stood before him. &quot;Wow, 
Kirara,&quot; he managed to choke out. &quot;I was right. You look beautiful!&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Shippo,&quot; Kirara said, this time in human tongue with a 
heavenly human female voice. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure that Sango would love to see you in this form when the time is 
right.&quot; 

&quot;I hope so.&quot; 

Kirara transformed back into her small, kitten-like form and walked back 
with Shippo to the campsite. Everyone was still sleeping soundly. &quot;Good 
night, Kirara,&quot; Shippo whispered as he got back under Kagome&#39;s sleeping 
bag. 

Kirara mewed in thanks as she curled up next to Sango again. Again, the 
cat-demon looked up at Sango&#39;s sleeping form. It was then that Kirara 
decided to try something a little bolder. She hopped up into Sango&#39;s 
body and curled up in the demon-slayer&#39;s lap. Sango sighed in her sleep 
as Kirara warmed her body. Kirara sighed in happiness as well and 
drifted into a peaceful sleep.
