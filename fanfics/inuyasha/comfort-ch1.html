<h1>Comfort</h1>

fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aimei.html">Aimei-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  Kagome saw Sango kneeling beside the graves, and rushed over to her. 
She sighed. 
 
  &quot;You should still be in bed.&quot; she said. Sango&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t move 
from the graves before her.
 
  &quot;... Are you the one that burried the villagers?&quot; asked Sango. 
Kagome&#39;s eyes widened slightly in shock.
 
  Kagome shook her head slightly. &quot;Yes... Me and the others did...&quot;

  Sango didn&#39;t move. &quot;Thank you...&quot; she responded, in the same tone.
 
  &#39;I can&#39;t exactly tell her to get over it...  She... lost all of her 
family... and friends... She&#39;s all alone... with no one to turn to for 
comfort... The only ones who ever cared for her are... dead...&#39; 
Kagome&#39;s expression saddened, &#39;If only I could give her the love she 
deserves... W-What did I just think!?&#39; She shook the thought from her 
head.
 
  &quot;... I-I&#39;m so sorry...&quot; Kagome asked, and looked down. Sango looked 
at her.
 
  &quot;... Kagome? That was your name, right?&quot; Sango asked, &quot;... Why?&quot;

  &quot;... W-What do you mean?&quot; Kagome looked slightly confused.
 
  &quot;You look... saddened... Why?&quot; Sango looked back to the graves.

  Kagome tilted her head slightly. &quot;I-It&#39;s just that... You... You&#39;re 
family and friends were all victims of Naraku... I don&#39;t know what I 
would do if my friends and family all died.... and I had no one to 
hold me... to make it alright...&quot; Kagome looked down, sadly. A tear 
escaped her eye.
 
  Sango looked back to Kagome, and wiped the tear away with her index 
finger. &quot;You... do not know me... and yet... You feel saddened because 
of my loss... How can you...?&quot; Sango was now curious...
 
  &quot;... I think it&#39;s... I... feel saddened when someone I care about is 
sad...&quot; Kagome responded. Sango reached a hand over, and placed it on 
Kagome&#39;s slightly shaking hand. Kagome looked up at her.
 
  She moved slightly closer to Sango, and gently pulled her over into 
her arms. She hugged her. Kagome felt Sango hug back, tightly.
 
  &quot;I... I am...&quot; Sango said, her voice breaking a bit, &quot;... alone... 
Th-They... Kohaku... Father... Everyone... They are... all gone... 
They are gone... Everyone...&quot; Kagome mumbled comforting words into 
Sango&#39;s ear.
 
  &quot;... Oh Sango... I&#39;m so... so sorry...&quot; Sango heard Kagome say. She 
pushed against her slightly, and looked up at her. Her eyes were 
swimming with unshed tears.
 
  Kagome looked at her. &#39;Gods, I wish there was something I could 
do...&#39; she thought to herself. Then, without thinking, she brushed her 
lips gently against the other girl&#39;s, then pressed them firmly, yet 
softly to Sango&#39;s. She felt Sango&#39;s lips respond, and slightly parted. 
Kagome&#39;s tongue slid between her lips, and swirled around Sango&#39;s 
tongue.
 
  After a moment, they broke appart, panting slightly. &quot;I... I&#39;m 
sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; Kagome said, but Sango silenced her with 
a finger to her lips.
 
  &quot;I did kiss you in return... It is as much my fault as it is 
your&#39;s...&quot; Both girls blushed. Kagome then locked eyes with Sango 
again.
 
  &quot;... I&#39;m not going to say that I... didn&#39;t enjoy it...&quot; she 
whispered. Sango smiled faintly.
 
  &quot;I... did as well...&quot; she blinked. Kagome then slowly moved forward, 
and pressed her lips against Sango&#39;s once again...
 
  &quot;Well, well, well...&quot; They heard Miroku&#39;s voice say. They broke 
appart, Kagome blushing a bright pink. There stood Miroku and 
Inuyasha.
 
  &quot;No, no! Don&#39;t stop! Just pretend we aren&#39;t here!&quot; Miroku said.

  Inuyasha blinked. Kagome blushed brighter. &quot;I was just... comforting 
her... That&#39;s all...&quot; Sango blinked.
 
  &quot;Yeah... I&#39;m sure you were.&quot; Inuyasha said sarcastically. He 
smirked.
 
  &quot;OSUWARI!&quot; Kagome shouted, slamming Inuyasha into the ground.

  She reached down, and took Sango&#39;s hand, pulling her up to her feet.
 
 &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go somewhere else...&quot; Kagome smiled. Sango nodded, 
and they started off in the other direction.
 
  &quot;Wait! Can I come too!?&quot; asked Miroku.
 
  &quot;NO!&quot;

Notes: What did you think? I enjoyed writing it(I didn&#39;t have to put 
any real effort into it... That&#39;s why it isn&#39;t very detailed or 
anything -_-)! Let me know what you think(I may even do a sequel) ^_^</pre>
