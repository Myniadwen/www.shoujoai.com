<h1>Flowers</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../inuyasha/index.html">InuYasha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/erufu.html">Erufu-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     Kikyou kneeled in the field of flowers, outstretching her right 
hand to pick one.  She slowly lifted it to her nose to smell it, the 
leaves tickling her chin.  Smiling slightly, she sat back on the grass 
and glanced up at the blue, puffy-cloud filled sky.  She loved flowers, 
and enjoyed simply smelling them sometimes.  Her favorites were always
camellias...

    Her thoughts drifted to the woman named Tsubaki soon after that.
She was a miko like Kikyou, but so beautiful...  Kikyou had already
admitted to herself that she had somewhat of a connection to her
&quot;rival&quot;.  Thinking back to what Tsubaki had said to her, she grinned.

    &#39;Never fall in love with a man...&#39;

    She hadn&#39;t.  Instead, she was beginning to believe that she had
fallen in love with a woman...

    Especially since everytime she saw her, her heart seemed to beat
faster than normal.  It was only after she had consulted some of the
elders of the village about it that she had learned what it meant...

    &quot;Is that alright, Tsubaki...?&quot; she asked to no one in particular
since the other miko wasn&#39;t anywhere close, to her knowledge.  Seconds
passed and she soon heard the grass being pressed down as she placed her
left hand on her bow, which was lying in the grass beside her and 
whirled her head around to see none other than the frequent object of 
her thoughts.

    &quot;Tsubaki?  How long have you been there?&quot; she questioned in her
typical tone causing the other woman to seat herself beside her, looking
out at the flower-field.

    &quot;Is what all right?&quot; she asked, with a slight smile.  Kikyou&#39;s eyes
widened a bit.

    &quot;You heard that?&quot;

    &quot;Yes, and I want to know what you meant.&quot; she replied and Kikyou
turned back towards the flowers as she lifted the one she had picked in
front of her a little.

    &quot;You do remember when you told me not to fall in love?&quot; Kikyou
questioned and Tsubaki blinked once.

    &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;

    &quot;I believe... that I may have, after all.&quot; she stated just above a
whisper, and Tsubaki sighed.

    &quot;You are a miko, like me.  But somehow I knew you would
eventually--&quot; she started, but Kikyou shook her head slightly.

    &quot;It. is not what you might think.&quot; Kikyou explained, gaining
Tsubaki&#39;s curiosity a bit.  &quot;The person I think I am in love with is...&quot;

    &quot;Is.?&quot; Tsubaki urged her to continue.

    &quot;You.&quot; Kikyou said and Tsubaki leaned in a bit closer.

    &quot;Who?&quot; she questioned causing the seemingly emotionless miko to
sigh.

    &quot;I think that I... love you, Tsubaki.&quot; she replied, holding her
breath in her throat as she waited and wondered what the other woman&#39;s
response would be.  She half expected her to get up and leave angrily or
to scold her for such improper thought but instead Tsubaki laid her hand
on Kikyou&#39;s shoulder.

    &quot;You do not have to worry about me becoming angry.  You are my
rival.  That does not mean that I can tell you what to feel, Kikyou.&quot; 
she stated, and Kikyou looked toward her.  &quot;I have thought for awhile 
you were in love...  But the way you acted, I did not believe it was 
with the half-demon.&quot;

    &quot;So you mean you do not hate me?&quot; Kikyou asked and Tsubaki looked
back out towards the field of beautiful flowers.

    &quot;Actually, it seems as though...  I love you, too.&quot; she replied in a
tone that was not the least bit modest.  &quot;I believe I did when I first
learned about you.  The kind but strong miko who can cure illnesses and
make children laugh with joy.  At first I thought about how different we
were, and then I came to think about other things...&quot;

    &quot;Other things?&quot; Kikyou asked, still surprised.

    &quot;Like... how pretty you were, your integrity and determination.  How
much I would like to... kiss you.&quot; Tsubaki responded and Kikyou leaned a
bit closer.

    &quot;You can still have the chance...&quot; Kikyou stated, and Tsubaki smiled
and leaned in, pressing a kiss to Kikyou&#39;s lips.  And after she pulled
away, they both returned their gazes to the flower-field.

    &quot;I am glad that I told you...&quot; Kikyou said after a moment or two of
silence.

    &quot;I am glad that I asked.&quot; Tsubaki replied, looking back at the other
miko.

    Kikyou had always thought - ever since childhood - that it was her
destiny to be a miko and to protect the Shikon no Tama...  But, 
something had changed that day.  Something would never be the same.

    And both Kikyou and Tsubaki knew that it would not as they sat there
together, enjoying their time each with the other in the small
flower-field just outside of the small fishing village...
