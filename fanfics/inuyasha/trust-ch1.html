<h2>a <a href="../inuyasha/index.html">InuYasha</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kikou.html">Kikou-chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  Kagome and Sango were sitting in on the ground, in a rather dark 
place. The only light emitted from the fire in the center of the room, 
that they were sitting around. The cave was also quite cold, so the 
fire was used to keep the two warm as well.
 
  &quot;How long have we been trapped in here?&quot; Kagome asked, boredly. Her 
chin was rested in her left hand, which sat on her knee. Her right 
hand layed across her lap. You could see the spots of dirt in her 
hair, on her face, and especially on her clothes. She looked as if 
she&#39;d been wallowing in the dirt for days. &#39;This is the worst day of 
my life...&#39;
 
  &quot;I suppose around a day.&quot; responded Sango, equally depressed. Her 
appearance was similar, but she didn&#39;t seem to pay as much attention 
to it as Kagome had...
 
  &quot;I wish Inuyasha would hurry up and find us already!&quot; Kagome whined, 
&quot;Why are we trapped in here anyway!?&quot;
 
  &quot;All that I remember is walking down that road, talking to you, when 
we suddenly feel down here through the ground. Some sort of trap 
perhaps. But we made our way through the cave, until we reached this 
area. That&#39;s where we came to the dead-end, and there seems to now be 
some kind of protective barrier that we can&#39;t get through. In other 
words, We can&#39;t get out.&quot; explained Sango, the same tone as before.
 
  Kagome sighed. &quot;Do you think Inuyasha, Miroku and Shippou will 
-ever- be able to find us?&quot;
 
  &quot;It depends on if they are following Miroku&#39;s or Inuyasha&#39;s 
instincts. Inuyasha can -sniff- us out, and Miroku can get them lost, 
so that they will never find us.&quot; Sango responded.
 
  &quot;I hate this.&quot; Kagome said. Sango just sighed her response.
 
  She noticed that Kagome was shivering... &quot;Are you cold?&quot; she asked.
 
  &quot;J-Just a-a l-little.&quot; she responded, through chaddering teeth, 
&quot;H-How c-could i-it g-get s-so c-cold d-down h-here a-anyway?&quot;  
 
  &quot;It must be the spell that was placed on the cave.&quot; Sango responded, 
and took off the upper part of her outfit, revealing part of her 
bodysuit-armor. She layed it over Kagome&#39;s shoulders.
 
  &quot;Thank you.&quot; Kagome muttered her thanks, &quot;But what about you?&quot;
 
  &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; responded the demon hunter, as she turned to the 
fire.
 
  Kagome looked at Sango. The light that reflected off the fire, 
brightened the features on her face, and caused her hair to shine 
slightly. The outfit she was wearing(she always wore it) clinged 
tightly to her features, and made her all the more enticing.
 
  &#39;What am I thinking?&#39; Kagome asked, silently. She shivered slightly 
at thinking that she found her best friend -enticing-.
 
  Sango smiled, upon seeing a confused look on Kagome&#39;s face. She 
looked like she had been told something quite strange, and unfamiliar. 
She was cute like that...
 
  &#39;She really is a sight to see.&#39; Sango giggled under her breath, 
&#39;What is happening to me anyway?&#39;
 
  &quot;So, You want to talk or something?&quot; Kagome asked, nervously. She 
had been down here with Sango for almost an entire day, and she hadn&#39;t 
been nervous around her before... Why now?
 
  &quot;About how to get out of this cave?&quot; Sango responded.
 
  &quot;Well, We could try going to the entrance, where we fell in at, or 
we could just sit here and wait for Inuyasha.&quot; Kagome said, and looked 
frustrated.
 
  &quot;I-If they... don&#39;t find us...&quot; Kagome started, but started 
sniffling.
 
  &quot;It&#39;s alright. They will find us, Kagome-san.&quot; Sango said, and 
reached over, placing her right hand comfortingly onto Kagome&#39;s left 
shoulder. Kagome started to cry, letting tears slip from her eyes. 
Sango moved over to Kagome, and wrapped her arms comfortingly around 
her. Kagome shifted slightly in Sango&#39;s arms, and snuggled into her 
embrace, crying openly.
 
  Sango let her chin rest upon Kagome&#39;s head, and began to stroke her 
back gently with one hand. She mumbled soft comforting words into 
Kagome&#39;s hair, as she felt Kagome&#39;s crying soften, until she was 
silent.
 
  Kagome looked up at her friend through tear filled eyes, and Sango 
looked down at her with a comforting expression.
 
  &#39;She&#39;s so beautiful...&#39; Kagome&#39;s thoughts trailed off, &#39;Am... Am I 
i-in l-love with S-Sango?&#39; Her eyes widened slightly. She just closed 
her eyes, and snuggled closer, more tears escaping from the edges of 
her squinted eyes.
 
  &quot;Kagome...&quot; Sango mumbled slightly. She hugged her tighter against 
herself, one hand on Kagome&#39;s back, the other on the back of her head, 
holding her securely in place. Her right thumb was stroking Kagome&#39;s 
hair, and her left hand was rubbing across Kagome&#39;s back soothingly. 
&quot;Sshh...&quot;
 
  &quot;Thank you, Sango... I feel much better now.&quot; Kagome smiled, and 
hugged her friend.
 
  &quot;It&#39;s alright. I don&#39;t mind.&quot; Sango replied, softly, &quot;I don&#39;t like 
to see you cry, Kagome...&quot; The second part was so low that most would 
have trouble hearing her, but Kagome, being as close as she was, heard 
it.
 
  Kagome blushed slightly. &#39;Could she feel the same way I feel?&#39; she 
asked herself. She glanced back up at Sango.
 
  &quot;S-Sango?&quot; she asked.
 
  &quot;Yes?&quot;
 
  &quot;H-Have you e-ever been in l-love with someone, before?&quot; Kagome 
asked. &#39;I guess it couldn&#39;t hurt... After all, Nothing ventured, 
Nothing gained.&#39;
 
  Sango blushed slightly. &quot;Well, I... I think I&#39;m in love with 
someone...&quot;
 
  Kagome&#39;s curiousity seemed to pique. &quot;Who?&quot;
 
  &quot;You... don&#39;t want to know.&quot; Sango responded, sighing once.
 
  &quot;Yes I do... Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s Miroku.&quot; Kagome said.
 
  &quot;No way!&quot; Sango couldn&#39;t help but nearly bust, &quot;I feel no kind of 
attraction what so ever to th-that lecherous hentai!&quot;
  
Kagome chuckled. &quot;Then, Who?&quot; she persisted. Sango sighed.
 
  &#39;Maybe I should tell her...&#39;
 
  &quot;I think that I&#39;ve...&quot; Sango swallowed a lump in her throat.
 
  &quot;That you&#39;ve--?&quot; Kagome asked, starting to become impatient.
 
  &quot;I think that I have... fallen in love with... with you...&quot; Sango 
responded. She let her head drop slightly, as she waited for Kagome&#39;s 
response...
 
  Kagome looked stunned to start, but her expression softened. &#39;She 
loves me! I can&#39;t believe she...&#39; she thought, but then noticed that a 
tear was escaping Sango&#39;s eye.
 
  &quot;I... I am sorry, Kagome-san...&quot; Sango appologized, and tried to 
pull away, but was surprised when Kagome held her sternly in her 
grasp.
 
  &quot;Don&#39;t appologize... Don&#39;t leave...&quot; Kagome mumbled, &quot;Please...&quot;
 
  &quot;B-But, Kagome... I--&quot; Sango started, but was interrupted by the 
slightly younger girl.
  &quot;I love you too...&quot;
 
  Sango&#39;s heart-beat seemed to increase substantially. She hugged 
Kagome tightly to her.
 
  &quot;A-Are you... sure?&quot; Sango asked, unsure if being down here to long 
had just gotten to her friend.
 
  In response to her question, Kagome leaned upwards, and pressed her 
lips to Sango&#39;s. The kiss was soft and tender. Sango&#39;s tension 
dropped, and she felt more comfortable. Kagome&#39;s tongue grazed her 
lips, practically asking for entrance. Sango slowly yielded to the 
kiss, and felt her barriers drop as she pressed her right hand against 
the back of Kagome&#39;s head, securing her even closer.
 
  Once the kiss broke, they looked at each other.
 
  &quot;Does... that answer... your... question?&quot; Kagome asked, in between 
breaths.
 
  Sango smiled. &quot;I guess it does...&quot;
 
  Both girls&#39; breathing eventually slowed to normal. &quot;Since it&#39;s 
already getting late, How about we go and look for the entrance to the 
cave first thing in the morning?&quot; Kagome asked, with a smile and a 
certain gleam in her eye.
 
  Sango caught the look she was giving her, and smiled back. She 
nodded, &quot;Sounds perfect.&quot;
 
*
 
  &quot;Where did they go!?&quot; demanded Inuyasha, as Miroku, Myouga, Shippou, 
and himself walked down a road, looking around.
 
  &quot;They just went off for a walk, and they haven&#39;t returned as of yet. 
Oh, What will I do without Sango!?&quot; Miroku whined.
 
  &quot;Kagome!&quot; yelled Shippou. He started to pout.
 
  &quot;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll find them.&quot; Myouga assured them, causing them to 
silence. Shippou sniffled, and Miroku pouted.
 
  &quot;It -is- possible that a youkai could have found them.&quot; Inuyasha 
looked back at Myouga, who was on Shippou&#39;s shoulder.
 
  This caused the other two to get even louder. &quot;Lord Inuyasha, Did 
you have to tell them that?&quot; Myouga asked, as he hopped up and down on 
Shippou&#39;s shoulder, trying to get him to be quiet. They eventually 
quieted down again.
 
  &quot;Well, Anyway, Let&#39;s just continue looking.&quot; Inuyasha responded, 
scowling...
 
*
 
  Sango cracked an eye open, to see Kagome wrapped up in her arms. 
Last night, they hadn&#39;t payed any attention to what was going on 
around them... Sango blushed at the memory of it.
 
  &quot;Kagome?&quot; Sango lightly shook her friend, by placing a hand on one 
shoulder, and gently pushing.
 
  &quot;Hmm?&quot; Kagome stirred after a moment, &quot;Is it morning yet?&quot;
 
  Sango nodded affirmatively. &quot;And we need to get dressed so we can go 
find the exit to this place.&quot;
 
  &quot;Alright.&quot; Kagome responded, dreading going through a dirty cave to 
find freedom, and not only that, but leaving the safety of Sango&#39;s 
arms. She nodded, dryly.
 
  Sango stood, followed closely after by Kagome. Sango handed her the 
Uniform that had been, hahem, taken off last night, and put her own 
clothes back on.
 
*
 
  A few moments later, Once they had dressed, and gathered their 
things, Kagome and Sango set out to find the entrance to the cave...
 
  They walked silently through the dark cave, and Kagome stopped 
suddenly.
 
  &quot;What&#39;s wrong Kagome-san?&quot; Sango asked.
 
  &quot;You know, You can quit calling me Kagome-san now.&quot; she responded. 
Sango blushed.
 
  &quot;Anyhow, I just remembered packing a flashlight with me when I left 
home...&quot; Kagome said, rummaging through her bag. She then found what 
she was looking for, &quot;Ah ha!&quot; she smiled triumphantly, and pointed it 
to the ground. She pressed a button, and light suddenly emitted from 
it, making the ground more visible in the darkness.
 
  &quot;Neat. What else do you have in your time?&quot; Sango asked, now 
curious, as they continued walking.
 
  &quot;Well, There&#39;s telivision, phones, computers, and many other 
electronics. There&#39;s also more kinds of foods.&quot; Kagome chuckled at 
Sango&#39;s confused expression.
 
  They both remained silently as they continued their way through the 
cave...
 
  It didn&#39;t take them much longer to reach the spot that they had 
fallen in at. They looked up to see cracks of daylight, but somehow, 
the entrance had been caved in.
  
Kagome sighed. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to find another way out.&quot;
 
  Sango looked around, finally choosing a pathway that led eastwards. 
She pointed to it. &quot;I think we should go that way.&quot;
 
  Kagome agreed, and they started walking in that direction.
 
  &quot;Maybe Inuyasha just forgot about us...&quot; Kagome said, and glanced 
downwards.
 
  &quot;I&#39;m sure Shippou wouldn&#39;t let him just forget about you.&quot; Sango 
smiled.
 
  A dreaded topic then came to mind. &quot;What will we do when we make it 
out of here?&quot; Sango asked.
 
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Kagome looked confused.
  She looked at Sango&#39;s face, then realised what was weighing on her 
friend&#39;s mind.
 
  &quot;Oh, Don&#39;t worry Sango. I&#39;m not going to leave you alone.&quot; Kagome 
smiled.
 
  &quot;But what happens when we complete the Shikon No Tama? You will want 
to go back to your time, and there will be nothing I can do to stop 
you...&quot; Sango responded.
 
  &quot;We&#39;ll figure out something, Sango... But, I love you. I&#39;m sure 
everything will work out okay. Besides, Didn&#39;t I already say that I 
wouldn&#39;t leave you alone? I trust you with my life... You do trust me 
too, don&#39;t you?&quot; Kagome asked.
 
  &quot;Trust is a very precious thing... People are given it. They give 
it. Then they break it...&quot; Sango responded, sadly, &quot;I just... I&#39;m just 
not sure... I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to let you go, Kagome...&quot; 
Sango looked at her friend&#39;s face, in the dim light.
 
  &quot;You won&#39;t have to...&quot; Kagome took Sango&#39;s hand, and squeezed it 
tightly, causing her to smile... Maybe not such a bad day after all...
 
*
 
  Sango and Kagome walked through the cave, and finally saw light 
shining down from the ceiling of the cave.
 
  &quot;Look, Sango!&quot; Kagome said, and ran over to the light area, 
&quot;Daylight!&quot; She pointed upwards at the hole.
 
  Sango walked over as well. &quot;You ready?&quot; she asked.
  &quot;How are we going to get out of here?&quot; Kagome looked at Sango.
 
  Sango smiled, and whistled once.
 
  Not long afterwards, Kirara, in her larger form, appeared at the 
entrance to the cave, looking down at them.
 
  &quot;It&#39;s Kirara!&quot; Kagome smiled.
 
  Sango motioned to Kirara to help them. The cat-youkai flew 
downwards, landing beside Sango. She thanked her, and looked at 
Kagome. Kagome nodded, and they both got onto Kirara.
 
  Kirara flew them to the top of the cave, and let them off, reverting 
back to its smaller form.
 
  &quot;Thank you Kirara.&quot; Kagome smiled. The small cat-youkai jumped up 
onto Sango&#39;s shoulder, where it sat down.
 
  &quot;Kirara, Do you know where the others are?&quot; Sango asked, and Kirara 
nodded. It jumped down, and led them in the direction of Inuyasha and 
the others...
 
*
 
  &quot;What was that all about? Kirara just transformed and flew off.&quot; 
Inuyasha said, starting to become annoyed.
 
  &quot;Maybe Kirara knows where Lady Kagome and Lady Sango went.&quot; Myouga 
offered, earning him a growl.
 
  &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s just keep going you two.&quot; Miroku said. Inuyasha 
glared at him, and he silenced himself...
 
*
 
  &quot;Look! There they are!&quot; Kagome cried happily, upon seeing the 
others. It had been about an hour since they had escaped from the 
cave, and she was starting to become exhausted.
 
  Shippou ran over, and jumped up into Kagome&#39;s arms. &quot;Where&#39;ve you 
been, Kagome?&quot; Kagome smiled at the young Kitsune.
 
  &quot;Sango!&quot; Miroku called. Sango just stayed where she was, beside 
Kagome.
 
  &quot;Where have you two been!? You realise we&#39;ve searched and searched 
for you!? We had to find you before we could continue our search for 
the jewel shards! Thanks for delaying that search!&quot; Inuyasha grumbled, 
and continue to talk about how Kagome shouldn&#39;t have wandered off like 
that, and other things that Kagome decided to pay no attention to.
 
  Sango smiled. She and Kagome had agreed to keeping what happened 
between them a secret. They would just talk about it what time they 
had to themselves, and tell the others as soon as they were ready.
 
  But one thing continued to bug at the back of Sango&#39;s mind... What 
would happen once the search for the shards ended? She continued to 
shove it back into its corner, remembering Kagome&#39;s words... &#39;She 
promised never to leave me alone... And I trust her...&#39;
