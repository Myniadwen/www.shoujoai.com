Rei awoken the next morning, and glanced up at the clock. It read 7:00 
AM. The ravenhaired miko yawned, with a stretch, before standing up 
off of her futon, and walking into her private bathroom.

After taking a cold shower, and brushing her hair, she dressed in her 
usual miko robe. {I think I&#39;ll just meditate until the others arrive.} 
she thought, and walked down the hall to the other room. She could 
hear rain outside, although it wasn&#39;t very loud, as she walked hastily 
down the hall...

~-3 Hours Later-~

Usagi was the first of the senshi to show up at the shrine, 
surprisingly...

&quot;Rei?&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice asked.

&quot;You still had another hour.&quot; responded the ravenhaired miko.

&quot;I know, but I just wanted to make sure I was here on time.&quot; said 
Usagi.

&quot;Oh well. Want some tea?&quot; Rei asked, and smiled weakly at her 
princess.

&quot;Sure.&quot; Usagi replied, shrugging her shoulders. Rei tipped the teapot 
over, letting freshly made tea pour into the teacup. She sat it down, 
gently, and handed the tiny cup to Usagi.

&quot;There are also some muffins if you want some.&quot; Rei said, and sat the 
small basket of muffins next to the teapot.

Usagi took a sip of the tea, &quot;Wow! This is great.&quot; Usagi said, and 
picked up a freshly baked muffin. She bit into it, &quot;The muffins are 
even better!&quot; Rei sighed. Usagi would always be the same odango-headed 
princess that all of the senshi knew and loved...

A moment or so passed, Usagi eating, and Rei occasionally sipping her 
steaming tea. She blew some steam away from it, and took another sip, 
before breaking the silence...

&quot;So, I guess we haven&#39;t a choice in the matter.&quot; Rei said, looking 
down.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; questioned the blonde odango-atama, looking up 
from the muffin, she was currently eating.

&quot;I mean, Going back in time and all. If we don&#39;t go, we will probably 
be destroyed along with the rest of the planet. At least, if we do go, 
We have a chance of saving it. As I said, We don&#39;t really have a 
choice in the matter of going or not...&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Rei... There&#39;s no reason for you to worry. Everything will go fine.&quot; 
Usagi assured her friend, smiling warmly, and taking another sip of 
tea. She remembered having a similar talk with Rei the night before...

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right...&quot; the miko said, her voice still unsure...

The two finished their cups of tea in silence, not even so much as 
looking at the other...

~-A While Later-~

Sometime later, Makoto, Minako, Ami, Setsuna, Haruka, Michiru, Hotaru, 
ChibiUsa, Luna, and Artemis arrived at the shrine. It was fifteen 
minutes until 11:00...

&quot;So, I guess this is it.&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Remember now... It&#39;s very dangerous traveling through time and 
space... You must not forget the reason you are there. And, also, We 
have to be careful not to end up in a different dimension instead of a 
different time...&quot; Setsuna informed the other eight, who would be 
going. 

&quot;So, I guess it&#39;s now or never guys.&quot; Minako said.

The others nodded, and everyone gathered infront of the Shrine. They 
transformed into Sailor Senshi. Everyone except ChibiUsa, Luna and 
Artemis took each other&#39;s hands, forming a circle. Usagi&#39;s locket 
opened revealing the crystal, and the light from it surrounded the 
nine girls. ChibiUsa stepped back. She, Luna and Artemis were going to 
stay and help grandpa Hino take care of the Jinja while Rei was gone, 
and hopefully come up with a good excuse to -why- Rei was gone...

The senshi all let their eyes close, in concentration, and a moment 
later, disappeared in one bright flash, leaving the two cats and the 
young girl... ChibiUsa held onto her Lunaball, and whispered softly, 
&quot;Be careful.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be okay ChibiUsa.&quot; Luna assured the young girl.

&quot;I just hope they make it there safely. They could fall into the wrong 
portal, and that would mess up everything.&quot; Artemis added.

&quot;Well, I suppose we should be thinking of how we are going to tell 
Grandpa Hino about Rei...&quot; ChibiUsa said, and the two cats agreed...

~-Inter-Dimensional Gateway-~

Usagi sighed, and gently opened her eyes, soon followed by the other 
senshi.

&quot;So, This is the right place?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Apparently, Yes.&quot; replied Ami.

&quot;We have to focus on the past, and we should end up there.&quot; Setsuna 
responded. They all continued concentrating...

~-~-~

Eventually, the nine found themselves waking up on the ground 
somewhere.

&quot;Where... are we?&quot; asked Haruka.

&quot;Did it... work? Guys?&quot; Usagi questioned, and looked around at the 
others, still lying on the ground weakly.

&quot;I think so...&quot; Makoto said, trying to place the area around them. Rei 
stood up, and dusted herself off.

&quot;This doesn&#39;t look like the Tokyo I know.&quot; Rei said, looking around at 
the trees and running streams.

&quot;Where... -is- Tokyo?&quot; questioned Hotaru, looking around as well.

&quot;I may be wrong... But, I -think- we just -may- have gone back to the 
past, a little to far.&quot; Minako stated, holding her index finger and 
thumb together infront of her.

&quot;This place looks like... Feudal Japan or something...&quot; added Haruka.

&quot;Yes... It does.&quot; Ami said. All of the senshi studied their 
surroundings, trying to make sense of it.

{Where the hell are we?} Rei asked herself. She eventually thought of 
something, and Setsuna&#39;s words, began to echoe through her head... 
&quot;Remember now... It&#39;s very dangerous traveling through time and 
space... You must not forget the reason you are there. And, also, We 
have to be careful not to end up in a different dimension instead of a 
different time...&quot;

&quot;That must be it!&quot; Rei said, her eyes popping open instantly.

&quot;What Rei?&quot; Usagi asked, her voice still weak, this time sitting up.

&quot;We must be in a different dimension... But, That means, we have to go 
back before its too late for -our- dimension!&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Oh no! How do we get back!? Setsuna!?&quot; Minako questioned, turning to 
the darkhaired woman.

&quot;We cannot go back yet... Usagi&#39;s power is low, and there is no way 
the Crystal can transport us all back yet.&quot; Setsuna said, after 
nodding her head.

&quot;How are we supposed to save -our- world!?&quot; Minako asked, in a panic 
of a voice.

&quot;We just have to wait until Usagi is strong enough to make the 
journey. Then, If we are lucky, Tokyo will still be there when we 
return...&quot; stated the darkgreen haired senshi.

Usagi suddenly felt dizzy, her eyes closing, as she faintsed, and fell 
backwards. Rei rushed to her side, and caught her before she could 
make contact with the hard ground. Rei sighed, in relief, and brushed 
a strand of hair from Usagi&#39;s eyes. Rei pulled Usagi all the way into 
her arms, and lifted her up, standing up as she did, and turned to the 
others.

&quot;What in the hell are we supposed to do!?&quot; Haruka said, frustrated.

&quot;Come on! Isn&#39;t there another way back?&quot; asked Michiru, looking at 
Setsuna, who stayed silence.

&quot;Dammit!&quot; shouted Rei, &quot;This is terrible! I thought for sure we&#39;d end 
up in the past of Tokyo! Not some... Prehistoric Jungle!&quot;

&quot;There is nothing more we can do here. We may as well seek shelter.&quot; 
Setsuna said, staring up at the sky. Dark clouds were moving in.

The others nodded in agreement, and began walking, the walk gradually 
turning into a run, in the direction of the nearest pathway, to find 
shelter, to get out of the rain. As they ran down the path, more and 
more trees seemed to appear overhead, blocking some of the pouring 
rain. {This is just wonderful... We go to the past to save the 
present, just to find that we went way to -far- into the past! We&#39;re 
in feudal Japan for God&#39;s sakes! And now, we can&#39;t even go home! We 
are all stuck in some prehistoric time that no one cares to think 
about!} Rei thought to herself, and looked down at Usagi {Not to 
mention that Usagi can&#39;t even make the journey back... How the hell 
did this happen!?} Her eyes narrowed {Maybe by tomorrow she&#39;ll be 
ready... I hope...} Rei brushed another strand of hair from her 
princess&#39; face. Her eyes were gently closed, her mouth just barely 
opened, and her pigtails trailed along behind Rei, as she ran. She was 
beautiful... Despite her childish attitude sometimes... Rei managed a 
smile, trying to forget the problems that were now creeping up on them 
so suddenly...

~-~-~

Someone was sitting on a treebranch, watching the nine girls run up 
the pathway. After they were gone out of sight, he lept down from the 
tree, onto the center of the pathway, long silver hair trailing behind 
him. He was wearing a red kimono and had a sword at his side... He got 
down on all fours, sniffing the ground... {Well they aren&#39;t demons 
but, They are headed straight for our campsite... They could be after 
the Shikon No Tama... I guess that means -I- have to tell the 
others...} he thought, with a snort, as his golden eyes narrow. He 
jumped up, and flew overhead towards the campsite...

Author&#39;s Notes: Any good? So, Just because I changed the stuff I 
mentioned before, I have still changed some things... I guess I should 
mention that the InuYasha characters are on their quest to retrieve 
the remainder of the jewel shards, and the characters that have showed 
up already are: InuYasha of course, Kagome, Kaede, Miroku, Sango(me), 
Shippo, and Myouga. They are the ones at the campsite, with the 
exception of InuYasha, in case you couldn&#39;t guess, was the one who was 
watching the sailor senshi. Well, Come back next time for the third 
chapter! But in the meantime, tell me if there is anything I could 
change to make it better, or give me any suggestions you can think of! 
I also want to know if it&#39;s going okay so far, and if there is 
something that should be changed! Well, Until Chapter three!
