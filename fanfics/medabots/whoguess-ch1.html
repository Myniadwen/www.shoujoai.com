------------------------------------------------------------

	As the first wavering beams of sunlight shone through the small 
apartment&#146;s window to dance upon the girl who lay in the bed still, a 
teakettle&#146;s whistle emitted from the kitchen. Sounds of someone 
bustling about came after it, the whistle stopping. The brunette 
yawned, rubbing her eyes, then opened them. Ruby orbs sleepily took in 
her surroundings. A room furnished mostly in pink, with a large 
collection of stuffed animals spread around the room, and quite a few 
magazine articles pinned to the wall.

	At that she smiled slightly. Erika had always thought she would 
become a reporter, but as she had grown her dreams had changed. She 
had instead become a magazine columnist, and was up to having three 
whole pages of her own. Her lover taught at Erika&#146;s old school, an 
easy favorite teacher for the children.

	Rolling out of bed she pulled on jean shorts and a white 
tank-top with the Medabots corporation logo on it, pulling back her 
hair a bit with clips. She still kept it short, not liking the 
problems that came with longer hair if you didn&#146;t have sufficient 
patience. She liked to play with longer hair, as she had with her 
elder sister&#146;s when she was younger, twisting it into complicated 
styles, but that charm still didn&#146;t sway her feelings on the subject. 
Yawning again, she padded into the hallway, then turned right into the 
living room and left into the kitchen, which was by the front door. 
The person in kitchen turned, and smiled.

	&#147;Erika, you&#146;re finally up! I made pancakes and tea.&#148; She 
motioned to the two plates at the table, and set down two cups of tea. 
Pushing some of her red hair over her shoulder, Karin smiled, green 
eyes bright. She usually waited for Erika to fix her hair, since the 
brunette loved doing so greatly. She sat down at the table, as Erika 
pulled out a chair and joined her.

	&#147;Mmm. Arigatou, Karin&#133;&#148; She yawned once more. &#147;I guess I&#146;m a 
little out of it from the all-nighter I pulled. Gah&#133;I had to finish 
that article.&#148; She gratefully sipped some tea and began on her 
breakfast. &#147;After all, I didn&#146;t want to miss Uncle Aki&#146;s birthday 
party, though he&#146;s still holding out on how old he is.&#148;

	Karin giggled softly. &#147;He&#146;s been doing that for as long as I can 
remember. It&#146;ll be nice to see everyone again. We haven&#146;t seen them 
since, what&#133;ano&#133;Your school&#146;s ten-year anniversary?&#148;

	Erika nodded, then looked thoughtful.

	&#147;Erika? Daijoubu desuka?&#148;

	&#147;It&#146;s just&#133;who could have guessed that we would end up together? 
Who could have guessed that things would turn out this way?&#148; She 
looked up from her plate when Karin placed a hand on her cheek, 
lovingly.

	When the other girl spoke, her voice was calm, and sweet. &#147;I 
could have guessed, Erika. I loved you from the moment we met.&#148;

	&#147;You did?&#148; Erika&#146;s voice was surprised, as was her expression. 
&#147;It always seemed like you had a crush on Ikki-chan or Kogee-kun back 
then. Or Rintaro-chan. I know you love me now&#133;but&#133;back then?&#148;

Karin smiled. &#147;Ikki-chan was my friend, as was Kogee-chan. I worried 
about them. And Rintaro-chan was so kawaii, just like a little 
brother! But you were always far more kawaii.&#148; Her eyes twinkled as 
Erika blushed.

&#147;Karin&#133;aishiteru. You are my other half.&#148;

&#147;Aishiteru. Anata wa watashi no taisetsu na hito desu.&#148; Karin said 
softly as the one who held her heart leaned in to kiss her.

Owari.

Translation of last line: I love you. You are my special person.
