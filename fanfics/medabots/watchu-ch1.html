<h1>Watching You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../medabots/index.html">Medabots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/forever3330.html">Forever3330</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	I&#146;ve never been one to get crushes; actually, I never HAVE had a 
crush. I never even had a crush on you. I just fell head-over heels in 
love with you, straight from the moment I met you. Even if it seems as 
if I don&#146;t&#133;it only shows through at small moments. But that&#146;s how I 
want it.

	Do you know what kind of love I mean? The romantic, passionate 
kind that keeps you going? The kind where you would sacrifice your 
life of feelings or anything for the sake of the one you love without 
a second thought? It&#146;s scary, in a way.

	Because you may never be loved back.

	But it&#146;s okay, I guess. I don&#146;t like the thought of you getting 
together with someone else. But that&#146;s the way I am. Jealous. It&#146;s so 
hard not to just reach out and take your hand, and ask if you would 
like to dance. But then, I&#146;m getting used to being a wallflower, 
leaning against the cold, hard stone, watching the couples twirl about 
in patterns I couldn&#146;t hope to break into, dancing along with you as 
my partner. You need to have a partner, after all, to dance at these 
things.

	They all like you too. It hard to see how they couldn&#146;t. I never 
thought I would fall in love, but after I met you it wasn&#146;t hard to 
see how I could. But I had promised I would only watch you, knowing 
that you would fall for one of them. Guessing you would fall for one 
of them. Wishing you wouldn&#146;t, that you&#146;d look into my eyes and see 
everything I can&#146;t say for fear of scaring you off. That you&#146;d accept 
it. That you&#146;d feel the same way.

	My heart is very, very bad. It&#146;s not making this whole &#145;not 
saying anything&#146; thing any easier on me.

	You see my gaze and smile gently, the smile that makes my heart 
flutter. &#147;Erika-chan, would you like to dance? Everyone else is still 
at the refreshment table, and this is my favorite song.&#148;

	My mouth must have said something without my permission again, 
because now I&#146;m dancing with you, twirling about in the dances that 
meant so little when I was just watching them. I&#146;m surprised to note 
that you&#146;re exactly my height now; I used to be taller. We pull closer 
and I see that you&#146;re mouthing the words, singing ever so softly, eyes 
at your feet.

	And you look up, seeing my eyes on you once again. And you 
smile, the simple expression faltering. &#147;E&#133;Erika-chan&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Hai?&#148; We&#146;re slowing down a bit, earning us angry glares from 
other couples.

	&#147;I&#133;&#148; You clear your throat. &#147;I&#146;ve been meaning to tell you 
something.&#148;

	&#147;What is it?&#148; I think my heart just sped up quite a bit.

	&#147;I like someone.&#148;

	And then stopped. &#147;Oh&#133;um&#133;oh, hey, there&#146;s the others with the 
drinks!&#148; I&#146;m about to go over to them, to my best friend and my other 
friends, but you grab my hand.

	&#147;Erika-chan! Hold on for just one moment!&#148; You pause, then sigh. 
&#147;I don&#146;t think they like me back.&#148;

	I stop, if only because you look so sad. &#147;I&#146;m sure they like you 
back.&#148;

	You smile sadly. &#147;As a friend only. Erika-chan, I&#146;ve been 
meaning to tell you who I&#133;&#148;

	My brain tells me I should run before my heart gets broken. My 
heart disagrees, though it doesn&#146;t want to be broken. It wants to stay 
with you.

	&#147;&#133;Who I like. I like you, Erika-chan.&#148;

	&#133;

	&#133;

	&#133;

	What just happened?

	&#147;You&#133;you what?&#148;

	You look away. &#147;I like you, Erika-chan.&#148;

	&#147;That&#133;that can&#146;t be true&#133;&#148;

	And then you lean in and kiss me, once.

	I really must be going insane. &#147;But&#133;&#148;

	&#147;Gomenasai&#133;I&#133;&#148; You turn to leave.

	&#147;Karin-chan, wait!&#148; I grab your hand this time, and you turn 
back to look at me, tears streaming down your face. &#147;I&#133;I like you 
too.&#148;

	And then we&#146;re hugging, and I feel a tap on my shoulder.

	&#147;Congratulations! We got the whole thing on tape!&#148; Ikki beams, 
proud of himself for not leaving the cap on the camera, most likely. 
He winks at me. Of course he knew whom I liked. He IS my best friend, 
after all. He used to have a crush on Karin, but then, he tends to get 
crushes. &#147;Right Metabee?&#148;

	&#147;Yo, Ikki? Kogee&#146;s out cold&#133;&#148; Metabee sweatdropped.

	&#147;Probably from seeing his life-long love kiss someone else.&#148; 
Sumiladon replied, shaking Kogee.

	&#147;Kogee-kun has a life-long love?&#148; You ask, blinking.

	Somehow I have a feeling you never had crushes either.
