(It starts with)
One thing / I don&#39;t know why
It doesn&#39;t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It&#39;s so unreal
Didn&#39;t look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on / but didn&#39;t even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I 
tried
so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn&#39;t even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn&#39;t even matter
One thing / I don&#39;t know why
It doesn&#39;t even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I surprised it got so (far)
Things aren&#39;t the way they were before
You wouldn&#39;t even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn&#39;t even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn&#39;t even matter
I&#39;ve put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There&#39;s only one thing you should know
I&#39;ve put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There&#39;s only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn&#39;t even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn&#39;t even matter

I had taken her two weeks to finally track him down. She wasn&#39;t fully 
recovered yet, her ribs still gave her quite a hard time for instance, 
but when she got the news that her primarily prey had made a &#39;business 
trip&#39; to Rio, she had immediately booked a flight.

She tipped her dripping cap further down over her head before carefully 
following the group of twenty men in the narrow and filthy streets of 
the favela. Hopefully, her oversized and more than worn out clothes 
would help her blending in the local fauna. For once, the black clouds 
in the sky were precious allies, they bathed the whole area in pools of 
darkness while the drum of the tropical rain covered any noise she 
eventually made. Of course, what helped her worked for her prey too... 
She had to be extremely cautious, this was unfamiliar, without 
mentionning very dangerous territory. In the short time she&#39;d been here, 
she had witnessed children, with machine-guns, killing each other for 
nothing more than cigarettes.

This time, she wouldn&#39;t underestimate her adversaries, she wouldn&#39;t 
repeat the same mistakes...

She reached under her tattered grey coat, readjusting her bulletproof 
vest, a Second Chance, not as good as Mithrill&#39;s A.S. gears, but much 
more discreet. The vest was a bit tight since she last used it and 
uncomfortably rubbed the skin of the small of her back, but at least it 
helped her steadying her torso. &#39;I must have put on some weight.&#39; She 
wrily thought as she saw her prey and his men rounding a corner. A long 
Cold Steel throwing blade was attached to each of her calves. A Taurus 
PT945 with two extra clips, a Steyr SPP with two extra 30-round clips 
too, and even two grenades in case things got really nasty, completed 
her equipment.

&#39;Sosouke must have rubbed on me...&#39; She smirked as she checked for any 
evidence of an ambush before heading for the same corner. Still, it was 
nice to see that many of her old &#39;contacts&#39; were still willing to pay 
their debts. Being an ex-agent of the Chinese secret services certainly 
had its advantages...

They were walking down the street and were about to turn right.

She quickly ran down a parallel street before turning left and hiding 
behind a decayed wall. Normally, she should have preceded them here for 
a few minutes. She looked around, analysing the ground and the 
opportunities it offered. The place she had ended up to wasn&#39;t different 
from any other in the favela, save for what was obviously a bar, 
surrounded by the rusty iron sheets and plastic cloth-made &#39;houses&#39; of 
the locals. It was most certainly where the group of men was headed to.

She was about to enter it when much sooner than she had thought, she 
heard them approaching. Silently swearing, she quickly covered behind a 
pile of garbage in the backyard and observed. Her prey, got in the bar 
with two of his men while the others took position all around it. None 
of them cared to check her hiding place, though.

A few minutes later, three men wearing expansive suits, obviously 
westerners, showed up. One of them was carrying a large briefcase. Her 
paranoya level was lifted a hundred floors up. Which kind of people 
could afford to wander around such a place dressed like that? They were 
like a piece of cheese in the middle of a rats&#39;s nest! They had to have 
a heavy support team hidden somewhere around.

She forced herself to calm down, breathing evenly. If that was the case, 
she had to be in complete control of herself.

As the westerners neared the entry door, they disappeared of her field 
of vision, but she soon realized she could hear everything, thanks to 
the thin walls.

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ahh, my friends! Welcome! Welcome!&quot; Paolo Gomez exclaimed after his men 
searched his three guests. His quite handsome face contorted in a fake 
smile when he greedily eyed the briefcase. He gestured toward a table. 
&quot;Have a seat and a glass of tequila!&quot;

The man who carried the briefcase wordlessly sat at the table, but 
purposely ignored the glass placed in front of him while his companions 
took position behind him.

Paolo chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s very impolite to refuse an offer of Paolo 
Gomez...&quot; The threat was clear in his tone.

The sitten man met his gaze steadily, showing absolutely no fear. &quot;Don&#39;t 
play around with us, Mr.Gomez, we have nothing in common with the 
farmers you so much like to terrorize. If I had had a word in the 
matter, I wouldn&#39;t have treated with you and your boss in the first 
place.&quot; He didn&#39;t even tried to hide his contempt.

At this words, Paolo pulled up a knife from his pocket and swiftly 
brought the blade inches from his offender&#39;s face. &quot;Don&#39;t insult me, old 
man! &#39;You&#39; came to me asking us for our help! &#39;I&#39; did you dirty work!&quot;

He didn&#39;t even have the time to finish when his attention was brought 
outside by the cries of his men and regular detonations. His two guards 
nervously drew out their guns, not knowing what to do, while Paolo ran 
to the door. He was almost out when one of the thugs literally fell in 
his arm. He was desperately trying preventing his intestine from 
spilling out of the large hole in his belly. Paolo brutally pushed him 
back and backed away in utter stupor as his man fell backward like a 
ragged doll.

An unnatural silence fell on the scene.

Paolo turned around to find that his two remaining guards were also 
lifelessly lying on the floor and that two guns were now aimed at him.

The man slowly stood up, making his chair loudly creak when he slid it 
away. &quot;Dirty work, indeed. However, it appears that you weren&#39;t even 
able to do it properly. Two of the soldiers you were supposed to 
eliminate survived and were able to report in. They gave quite detailed 
information to their supervisers about our own employees and the engine 
&#39;we&#39; lend you. You&#39;ll understand that it is impossible for us to keep 
business with you and Mr. Don Jose...&quot;

Paolo tensed, fully expecting being shot at. His grip on his knife 
tightened. If he was going down, he wouldn&#39;t go alone.

Instead of that, the man simply opened his briefcase, which was full of 
US dollars. &quot;Here is the rest of the promised payment.&quot; With that, he 
quietly walked past the frozen drug dealer, his bodyguards exiting 
shortly after him.

----------------------------------------------------------

Melissa applied the last touch to her make-up and gave herself a once 
over. Perfect. The red gown she wore was a real killer. It had spaghetti 
straps which were tied behind her neck. It also left her back completely 
bare while it flew down to her ankles and was slitted up to mid-thigh on 
the right side. She wore red court shoes, a silver necklace with a 
single tear- shaped saphire and simple diamond earrings. Satisfied, she 
finally put on a long-haired wig. She smiled at her reflection in the 
miror en-pied of her new hotel room. Even without the wig, she was a 
completely different person dressed up like that. Her disguise would 
hinder him from recognising her as well as lure him in her trap. She 
frowned, thinking back about Paolo and what had happened earlier in the 
favela...

- Outside, Melissa was equally stunned by the events of the past few 
minutes. She watched the three men leave, hesitating on whether or not 
she should tail them and finally deciding against the idea. She had no 
idea of what she would face. Too risky. Besides, she wasn&#39;t even a 
member of Mithrill anymore. She would just drop them a line.

The corpse of one of the goons was lying not far, staring at her with 
blind eyes. She could easily see the kind of specific damage the bullet 
had done. A normal hole at the point of impact, but an enormous one in 
the area where the bullet had exited the body. The bones had shattered 
like glass while the flesh had been lacerated by the kinetic energy.

High velocity bullets, which meant snipers. And highly qualified ones if 
she was any judge...

Large quantities of blood were already washed away by the rain, mingling 
with water and mud. In a few hours, nothing would remind anyone of what 
had happened. This men were already forgotten.

Mankind was nothing. Mankind meant nothing, no matter how much blood was 
spilt.

She would be forgotten soon too.

Melissa shook her head when she realized that Paolo had run out of the 
bar with the briefcase and was fleeing for all he was worth.

She cursed and left her hiding place to discreetly follow him.

Yes, she would be forgotten.

But before that, she had something to do... -

Not very surprisingly, Paolo had changed from his usual big hotel in 
downtown to another one, he had changed his return ticket for an ealier 
flight in two days too. But apart from that, he hadn&#39;t changed his other 
habits much. The first evening after the meeting, he was already in the 
lobby of his new hotel with two babes...

&quot;&#39;Guess he&#39;s figured that if his little friends wanted him dead, he 
would be feed for worms by now...&quot; Why they hadn&#39;t killed him was a 
mistery to her. The only reason she could think of was that they didn&#39;t 
want to get involved in a war with his boss. Nevertheless, something in 
the back of her mind was naggingly telling her that she was set up. She 
shrugged, it wasn&#39;t like she had anything left to lose anyway. A brief 
pang of regret gripped her when she thought about a peculiar young 
captain. In many respects, it would have been so much better if she had 
just died in the jungle...

Her arrival didn &#39;t go unnoticed at all, that was the least that could 
be said. She slinked in the lobby towards the bar, each of her steps 
drawing more lustful eyes, even some admirative whistles. A little smile 
playfully tugged at her lips, She wore casual and military clothes for 
so long that she had almost forgotten what it was.

She sat herself to the bar, ordering a scotch. She didn&#39;t have to wait 
long before a man approached her and offered her another drink. She had 
to elegantly brush away two other admirers before seing her prey finally 
enter the lobby. He noticed her right away and confidently walked to 
her. And so, the evening had gone like this, Melissa and Paolo, flirting 
with each other until they decided to go upstairs...

Paolo followed her in the lift where they were alone and came on her as 
soon as the doors were shut. She forcefully suppressed a shudder of 
disgust when he began to greedily kiss her neck and grop her breasts. 
Thankfully, the elevator soon came to a stop and she shied away from 
him. &quot;Mmmh, you don&#39;t get any of this...&quot; Her voice was velvet. She 
playfully tugged at his tie, leading him in the hall. &quot;We have all 
night...&quot; She suddenly backed him against a wall, pressing herself 
against him and cupping his crotch with her left hand. &quot;... And I intend 
to take my time...&quot;

He sucked in a breath. &quot;You sure know how to talk to a man, baby.&quot; He 
wrapped his arms around her waist and led her to his suite. Then he 
released her and turned his back to her to open his door. &quot;I&#39;m gonna 
make you scream like you never have...&quot;

Behind him, Melissa&#39;s eyes were those of Death itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The Major Karirin quietly entered the command room and took his usual 
place behind Thessa. &quot;We just received a report from Brazil. Don Jose&#39;s 
right hand man has been murdered.&quot; He handed her the copy of the police 
report. She winced when she saw the pictures. The scene of crime was a 
complete butchery.

&quot;He was involved in the disaster that was the KTP-0358 mission, wasn&#39;t 
he?&quot;

&quot;According to our sources, yes, he was.&quot; Karirin confirmed.

&quot;A private vendetta?&quot;

Karirin tensed slightly. He didn&#39;t like what he was about to say. 
&quot;Apparently so, but not from a concurrent...&quot;

Thessa looked at him curiously. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Witnesses testify that he was last seen in the company of a woman. The 
description doesn&#39;t match her, but... we know for a fact that Melissa 
Mao was on a flight for Rio de Janeiro six days ago... And the police 
collected a great deal of fingerprints at the crime scene. We ran them 
in our data base, I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re hers...&quot;

Thessa&#39;s brain refused to process the piece of information...

AN: I know, it&#39;s a bit clich&eacute;, especially the &#39;He sucked in a breath. 
&quot;You sure know how to talk to a man, baby.&quot; He wrapped his arms around 
her waist and led her to his suite. Then he released her and turned his 
back to her to open his door. &quot;I&#39;m gonna make you scream like you never 
have...&quot;&#39; line (I burst out laughing when I wrote it). What can I say? 
Too many bad spies movies... As for making a former special executive 
operative of the Chinese secret services of Mao, well, I figured she had 
to have a troubled past. How does someone end up in a secret military 
organisation like Mithril anyway? For those who like these kinds of 
details:

- The Taurus PT945 is a double-action pistol that shoots 45 ACP 
(magazine capacity: 8 rounds).

- The Steyr SPP (Special Police Pistol) is a double-action pistol that 
looks like a submachine-gun, it can be used in full-auto mode. It shoots 
9mm NATO (magazine capacity: 15 rounds, but 30 rounds available).

- Cold Steel is a knife factory (obviously).

- Second Chance is one of the most renown body armor factory, 
appreciated for the reliability and comfort of their products (and 
believe me, you want it both! No, I don&#39;t work for them).
