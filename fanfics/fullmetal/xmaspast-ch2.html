<h1>Christmas Past (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fullmetal/index.html">Full Metal Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../fullmetal/xmaspast-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;Oh, Alex,&quot; Melissa Mao sounded disgusted as the half
Asian woman moved a bit to shield Tessa with her body.

&quot;Sorry about this, Mel,&quot; Alexandria Kinnaid said
calmly, holding a pistol on them both from where she
stood at the other side of the circular table. The
blonde haired beauty was stunning, in a California
girl sort of way, and it made the cruel glint in her
eyes even more startling in comparison.

&quot;Let me guess,&quot; Mao kept her hands up, the black
haired woman deceptively calm, &quot;you&#39;re working for
Amalgam?&quot;

Alex nodded, the caf&eacute; around them deserted as her
armed companions finished driving out the customers
into the snow outside, &quot;They contacted me after I left
the Marines, much like I&#39;ve heard you were scouted by
Mithril.&quot; A smile, &quot;Ironic, no?&quot;

&quot;Hilarious,&quot; Mao said dryly.

&quot;How can you do this?&quot; Teletha &quot;Tessa&quot; Testarossa
asked, the smaller woman peering from behind Mao, &quot;I
thought the two of you were...&quot;

Alex laughed, &quot;Spare me.&quot; A cruel smile, &quot;Mel here was
a good fuck back when we were Marines, nothing more.
And now you&#39;re going to make me a great deal of money,
when Amalgam squeezes Mao dry and I hand you over to
Mr. Silver, Tessa.&quot;

&quot;No way in hell,&quot; Mao said, kicking out at the table
where they had begun this meeting so innocently. It
slammed into Alex, stunning her as Mao lunged forward
to grab at the other woman&#39;s gun.

Tessa drew her pistol a bit clumsily from beneath her
casual clothes and turned to the startled Amalgam foot
soldiers and fired, sending the men diving for cover.
Speaking into a button on her shirt collar she
shouted, &quot;Go!&quot;

From a sniper position across the street Kurtz Weber
grinned, the blonde haired man pulling the trigger on
his rifle. &quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; he murmured as he pulled the
trigger, dropping a soldier foolish enough to be out
behind cover.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Alex cursed as she fought for the gun, &quot;you
knew it was a trap?&quot;

Mao punched her, sending blood splattering as she
ripped the gun from Alex&#39;s hands, &quot;No, but I&#39;m not
taking someone as important to me as Tessa along
without a few precautions.&quot;

Bursting through a caf&eacute; window Sosuke Sagara dove in
amid the Amalgam troops, his knife flashing as the
combat suited teen went to work. His dark brown hair
fell into his eyes as he ducked beneath desperate
blows and lashed out with deadly efficiency, blood
splattering the tile on the floor.

&quot;Is that everyone?&quot; Tessa asked, trying to keep any
quiver from her voice.

From outside Kurtz swept the snowy streets, her eyes
narrowed beneath the civilian clothes he wore for
disguise. Not to mention the winter gear keeping him
warm in his snow covered perch. &quot;A few stragglers,&quot; he
reported, &quot;but I think Amalgam&#39;s calling it a night.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Alex asked as she wiped blood from her face,
standing with her few surviving troops, &quot;what now?&quot;

&quot;I should kill you,&quot; Mao said dryly as she held her
gun on them steadily, &quot;we certainly can&#39;t hand you
over to the police or the US military.&quot;

&quot;Ready,&quot; Sosuke said calmly, his rifle freed from his
back pack and ready to go.

&quot;But it&#39;s nearly Christmas,&quot; Mao said after a moment,
&quot;so I think mercy is possible.&quot; She nodded to the
door, &quot;Get out of here while you can.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re kidding me,&quot; Alex blinked even as her and her
men slowly began to edge towards the doors.

&quot;Mao?&quot; Tessa looked up at her in alarm as Alex and her
surviving team bolted.

Mao gestured her to silence even as she used her
radio, &quot;Kurtz, you see them?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re moving out,&quot; Kurtz agreed as he packed up his
sniper gear, his teammates already prepared, &quot;we&#39;ll
follow them back to their hidey-holes and capture them
there. Hopefully we&#39;ll get some additional leads on
Amalgam this way.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t do anything stupid,&quot; Mao added.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know you cared,&quot; Kurtz said as he and his
team raced across the rooftops.

&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; Mao shot back, &quot;but filling out all the
forms if you get yourself killed would be a pain in
the ass.&quot;

&quot;And here I was worried that you were being soft on a
old friend,&quot; Tessa shook her head, smiling slightly.

&quot;Nah, I&#39;m just a evil old lady,&quot; Mao grinned back.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Sosuke saluted, &quot;request permission to join
them?&quot;

&quot;Granted,&quot; Mao nodded, &quot;and watch yourself. I&#39;m pretty
sure Chidori would be annoyed if you got yourself
killed.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sosuke said, moving off into the night.

Finally relaxing a bit Mao turned to Tessa, &quot;Are you
all right?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Tessa puffed out a sigh at Sosuke leaving her
without a word. Of course that was to be expected from
the all business soldier, but it still hurt.

&quot;Want me to talk to that blockhead?&quot; Mao offered as
they left the caf&eacute;, both women grabbing their
thankfully undamaged coats before leaving.

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Tessa shook her head. She smiled a bit
sadly, &quot;I understand that I can&#39;t change what sort of
man Sosuke is.&quot;

The snow crunched beneath their boots as they walked
down the street, away from the caf&eacute; and the violence
that had happened there. &quot;Are you in any hurry to go
back to the TDD?&quot; Mao asked, her breath showing in the
winter air.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Tessa smiled, &quot;I received my family
letter earlier this week. We rarely do more than
that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, my family and I don&#39;t do much either,&quot; Mao
understated. She looked down at Tessa, &quot;How about you
and I do our own, private celebration then?&quot;

Tessa gave her a searching gaze then smiled once more,
&quot;I think I&#39;d like that.&quot;

&quot;Good, we&#39;ll go get dinner,&quot; Mao waved grandly, &quot;get
drunk and do kareoke.&quot;

&quot;Gee, I almost wish I had been kidnaped,&quot; Tessa
groaned.

&quot;Don&#39;t be a stick in the mud,&quot; Mao laughed.

&quot;I am not,&quot; Tessa stomped her foot.

&quot;Ha, I bet you couldn&#39;t even keep up with me,&quot; Mao
grinned.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Tessa gave her a look, &quot;we&#39;ll see about
that.&quot;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;Welcome back, Captain,&quot; Commander Mardukas said, the
older man smiling as Tessa climbed out of the copter.

&quot;Oooh,&quot; Tessa winced, &quot;quiet, please.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a little hung over,&quot; Mao said as she assisted
Tessa down the steps to the deck.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Richard Mardukas demanded.

&quot;I think it was the vodka shooters,&quot; Mao mused, &quot;or
maybe the Long Island ice teas that did it, I&#39;m not
sure.&quot;

&quot;Why did you let...?&quot; Mardukas started.

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Tessa waved them to silence, her expression
pained, &quot;fight LATER.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mao sighed.

&quot;Oh, Richard?&quot; Tessa said as they walked.

&quot;Yes?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Melissa Mao&#39;s room assignment is being changed,&quot;
Tessa revealed, &quot;she&#39;s moving in with me.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Mardukas blurted, stopping in surprise.
Hurrying to catch up he demanded, &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Do you really want the details?&quot; Mao smirked even as
she took Tessa&#39;s hand.

&quot;Ah, never mind,&quot; Mardukas blushed.

&quot;Were you intending to seduce me last night?&quot; Tessa
asked softly as they walked on.

&quot;I&#39;d thought about it,&quot; Mao admitted, &quot;as far back as
that damned paint ball fight.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Tessa looked surprised.

Mao smirked, &quot;You&#39;re sexy when you&#39;re victorious.&quot;

Tessa blushed.

Notes: This is based on mostly my imagination, as well
as the close friendship between the characters in FMP.
The Wikipedia articles on FMP were also used for
reference, as well as to refresh my memory on plot
points. I may or may not go into detail on their night
out later, as I&#39;m pretty sure it would end up as a lemon-fic.</pre>
