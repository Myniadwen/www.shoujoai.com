<h1>Bulletproof (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fullmetal/index.html">Full Metal Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fade.html">Fade</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../fullmetal/bulletproof-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>After much thoughts, I decided to insert some parts of FMP Fumuffu 
(episodes 7 &amp; 8 to be precise), but my way, to suit it, which means 
darker... &#145;Infidelity&#146; is a song from the excellent album &#145;Stooch&#146;, by 
Skunk Anansie.

Lost infidelity We&#146;ve never said a word So black and white you see It&#146;s 
all the lies we&#146;ve heard

In my mind nothing makes sense I&#146;m nothing you can&#146;t have Cracked up to 
disagree It&#146;s all we&#146;ve ever had

You, only you, only you Can&#146;t be the one...

Thessa sighed. She was supervising the repairs on the Thuata De Danaan 
with Major Mardukas, but her mind was completely elsewhere. She didn&#146;t 
know what to feel anymore, something had gone wrong, terribly wrong. And 
she didn&#146;t know what...

------------------------------------------------

When she had learnt that Melissa had awakened, she had almost fainted 
with joy, then had literally teleported to the hospital, only stopping 
to buy a bouquet of flowers on the way. Weber and the others had barely 
managed to keep up with her. Once in front of the door, nervousness 
gripped her, though. She had thought about what she would say thousands 
of times, but now, it was as if she had exchanged her brain for a pea. 
And an over-cooked one, at that! She unconsciously rearranged herself 
before gently knocking at the door.

&#147;Come in.&#148; Had answered the sergent-major. The voice was quite weak, but 
it was to be expected after all.

When she opened the door, the brown-haired woman was sitten in her bed, 
staring in deep thoughts at the window. She was bathed in the rays of 
the early afternoon sun. The bruises hadn&#146;t disappeared yet and she 
probably had more bandages and stitches than any mummy had, but in 
Thessa&#146;eyes, she had all the beauty of a fallen angel.

Dangerous and fragile at the same time.

Broken, but not vanquished...

Thessa had entered the room, the same dopey smile that hadn&#146;t left her 
since she had heard the good news plastered on her face. Melissa had 
looked quite surprised to see her and Thessa saw something flicker 
behind those beautiful purple eyes, though she wasn&#146;t too sure how to 
interpret it. Nevertheless, she crossed the room, set the flowers on the 
nightable and without preamble, enfolded the older woman in a thight, 
though careful embrace.

And the dam broke.

All the tears she had refused to shed flew now steadily down her cheeks. 
Melissa seemed to hesitate, but finally wrapped her arms around the 
young captain. They stayed like that for what seemed like hours, 
Thessa&#146;s sobs the only sound breaking the silence.

Finally, Thessa calmed down and whispered in Melissa&#146;s ear. &#147;Why didn&#146;t 
you tell me? I love you too...&#148;

Melissa tensed. &#145;She knows. Of course she knows, you moron. The 
camera...&#146; Inwardly, she bitterly laughed at herself. Her life was such 
an ironic bitch! She gently but firmly pushed her away. Her resolve 
almost faltered when she saw the glistening and confused face of the 
young woman, but she had to do it. &#147;You can&#146;t love me. Please, forget 
it. I was delusional.&#148; She lied. &#147;It was an... error...&#148; She averted her 
gaze and stared at the window again. She couldn&#146;t stand the look of hurt 
and betrayal that appeared in those silvery eyes.

Thessa choked on the words. It was as if she had just been slapped. 
What? What was happening? She reached out, cupping the brown-haired 
woman&#146;s face and forcing her to look at her. The purple eyes were cold, 
distant, impersonal. &#147;...Why?&#148; She croaked out.

She swallowed with difficulty and tried again. &#147;I... I thought you love 
me... I really love you. I&#146;m in love with you... It&#146;s not like with 
Sosouke... Why? ... Please, don&#146;t push me away!&#148; She was on the verge to 
cry again. On impulse she leaned in, she wanted to prove how sincere she 
was...

The sergent-major stopped her, placing her hands on her shoulder and 
keeping her at arm&#146;s length. Melissa&#146;s voice was as empty of emotions as 
were her eyes. &#147;No, you probably think that you love me now, but in a 
few weeks you&#146;ll wake up and realize how silly it all was, trust me. 
You&#146;re a brilliant, beautiful young woman. A bright future&#146;s awaiting 
you. You shouldn&#146;t get involved in such an embarassing relationship. I 
know you&#146;ll regret it. I shouldn&#146;t have said what I said, it was a 
terrible mistake.&#148;

Thessa was suddenly paralized with anger. She jerked away as if she&#146;d 
been bitten, her gaze became icy. &#147;How could you...?&#148; She seethed. &#147;You 
think you know ho...&#148;

She was about let her anger explode when Weber irrupted in the room. 
&#147;Sis&#146;! You&#146;re awake! Your bad habit of sleeping in scared the shit out 
of us, y&#146;know?&#148; In a second, he was on the other side of the bed and was 
glomping his victim senselessly.

&#147;Kurz! Rhaaa! Let go! You&#146;re killing me! Ever heard about the Convention 
of Geneva?&#148; Melissa tried breaking free from the blonde sergent. Sadly 
for her, she was still too weak to resist him. Actually, she was 
probably too weak to fight back a lady-beetle...

He completely ignored her. &#147;You&#146;ve been a naughty girl! Running off like 
that by yourself! Daddy Kurz shall spank you...&#148;

Years of practice finally took over and Weber quickly found himself 
embedded in the floor. &#147;... Glad to see... that you&#146;re recovering just 
well.&#148; Amazingly enough, he still had all his teeth.

When Melissa turned back to Thessa, it was to discover that the young 
captain had already left...

-------------------------------------------------

The two of them had played cat and mouse ever since. Thessa trying 
cornering her and getting a real explanation and Melissa avoiding her. 
The only time she managed to have a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with the elusive 
sergent-major was just after the funerals held for their fallen 
brothers-in-arm. Melissa had been so cold and harsh that Thessa had had 
trouble to recognize her. It had resulted in another night of cries for 
her. Was she the same person as on her precious record? And there was 
those rumors... Those rumors that said that Melissa was out every night 
since she was strong enough to do so. Going out with a different man 
each night and getting drunk... She didn&#146;t want to believe these rumors 
but... Jealousy burnt her like acid. The emotional turmoil was slowly 
but surely eating at her.

She found herself wishing that the brown-haired woman would just leave. 
Or better, that she hadn&#146;t ever met her...

But she was entitled to stay at the base for as long as her complete 
recovery would take, since she had been hurt on duty and didn&#146;t have 
anywhere else to go.

Things just couldn&#146;t go on like that.

&#147;... You should take some vacation...&#148;

Mardukas&#146;s voice wrenched her from her thoughts. She contemplated the 
idea. It was a good one, at least, she would be away...

Somewhere away from all of her responsabilities...

Away from her...

And two could play.

--------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Have you heard the news?&#148; Kurz drawled.

Melissa, who was currently eating, just groaned an incoherent reply. 
They were alone in the mess at this time of the day.

&#147;Our lovely captain&#146;s decided to have a little vacation. Guess who she 
decided to go and pay a visit to?&#148;

The chopsticks stopped midway between her mouth and her plate. Her other 
hand balled into a fist. She forced herself to relax. It was what she 
had wanted, after all... And she wasn&#146;t worried about Sosouke, she knew 
he would never touch her, if only because Kaname would keep an eye on 
him.

&#147;But knowing Sosouke, nothing&#146;s gonna happen. The guy&#146;s haven&#146;t even 
scored with Kaname yet! Tssk!&#148; Kurz stretched like a contented cat. &#147;But 
luckily for these poor neglected girls, Kurz Weber is assigned to their 
protection too. I&#146;m supposed to join Sosouke in five days...&#148;

&#147;... And what?&#148; Melissa cut him off sharply. &#147;Are you going to seduce 
them, take advantage of them, then let them down like used tissues as 
you usually do?&#148;

Weber looked offended. &#147;I haven&#146;t seen you acting any differently the 
past week, sis&#146;. Anyway, I don&#146;t take advantage of them! I teach them 
the real meaning of pleasure.&#148; His voice dropped to a leer. &#147;Imagine our 
sweet captain naked, beautiful lips asking to be kissed, jingling 
breasts shouting to be gropped and sucked on. And finally, smooth, white 
legs spreading for me. I&#146;m almost sure she&#146;s a virgin, how I&#146;ll enjoy 
tak...&#148;

He didn&#146;t have the time to finish his sentence. Melissa had shot out of 
her chair and before he knew what happened, he was flat against the 
wall, her iron grip around his neck.

In many ways, Mao reminded him of his real sister, although he wished 
she didn&#146;t. They often had the same kinds of arguements a brother and a 
sister would have and he quite enjoyed them, but this... This was very 
different from all the other times. There was real hatred in those 
purple eyes and for once, he sincerely feared for his life. He also saw 
the purest of jealousy in them and from experience, he knew that he 
wasn&#146;t the real cause of this jealousy. So, he had been right. There was 
something going on between the two women...

Trying vainly to keep images of them together in the bath, he managed to 
smirk despite the tightening hold on his throat. &#147;I think she loves you 
too, you should tell her...&#148; He croaked, hoping it would distract her.

That worked. Her eyes widened and she let him go. She watched him as he 
breathed laboriously, massaging his sore throat. &#147;It&#146;s none of your 
business, Weber...&#148; She turned around and walked out of the mess. She 
stopped at the door though and keeping her back to him said &#147;Touch her 
and I&#146;ll kill you...&#148;

She first headed to the transmission room. A short peek inside. She 
smiled in satisfaction. Nobody. She entered the room and sat in front of 
one of the impressive machines. She pirated the system, then sent an 
encoded message. She waited for the answer, replied and finally, 
carefully erased all traces of her passage before leaving for Mardukas&#146;s 
office. Hopefully, it wouldn&#146;t be too hard to persuade him to send her 
as reinforcement on the &#145;vacation&#146; mission.

AN: Ahhh, what&#146;s going on with Melissa? Answers in the next chapter! 
Well, once I get some sleep, though... And even though Kurz is the 
typical comic relief character, I don&#146;t think he&#146;s as dense as he would 
like us to believe he is, at least not when it comes to relationships... 
By the way, if you haven&#146;t watched FMP Fumuffu, here&#146;s a very edited 
resumee of the episodes I&#146;m talking about: While checking on the repairs 
on the De Danaan, Mardukas notices that Thessa&#146;s tired and offers her to 
take a vacation. She accepts and decide to go the same school as Kaname 
and Sosouke for one week. Poor Sosouke&#146;s having a hard time when Mao 
finally arrive. Weber comes along and they all go to a onsen (hot 
springs) for the week-end.</pre>
