it&#39;s bugging me
calling me
and twisting me around

yeah I&#39;m endlessly
caving in
and turning inside out

because I want it now
I want it now
give me your heart and your soul
and I&#39;m breaking out
I&#39;m breaking out
that&#39;s when she&#39;ll lose control

and I want you now
I want you now
I feel my heart implode
and I&#39;m breaking out
escaping now
feeling my faith grow old

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you...&quot; She whispered. She numbly shook her head. It 
was impossible, Melissa wasn&#39;t able to commit such atrocity! &quot;I DON&#39;T 
BELIEVE YOU!&quot; She angrily threw the report on the deck, sheets of papers 
lazily gliding in the command room with a soft ruffle.

She jumped to her feet, facing the major. &quot;Melissa can&#39;t do that! She&#39;s 
not a murderer! She wouldn&#39;t! SHE WOULDN&#39;T, DO YOU HEAR ME?&quot; An uneasy 
silence fell after her outburst, the various officers present taken 
aback save for Karirin and Mardukas.

&quot;Pardon me for interfering Ma&#39;am, but how would you know? She&#39;s a 
trained soldier, killing people has always been part of the job 
description. Besides, we know very little about her past, which is 
partly why she&#39;s never been promotted over the rank of sergent-major or 
allowed to pilot the Aru.&quot; Mardukas asked, the slightest hint of 
reproach coloring his tone.

Thessa was shocked to the core. She knew all of this of course. After 
all, the final decision in both matters had been entirely hers, but 
having it casually brought up in this situation was like a slap in the 
face. She knew. And Melissa undoubtly knew too. She felt like the most 
hypocritical person in the world at the moment.

Melissa had known all along, and still, she had fallen in love with her. 
At least, that was what the Mao in the record Thessa had preciously 
preserved was telling her everynight... She didn&#39;t even tried stopping 
the tears that flowed from her eyes. How pathetic! Clinging like that 
onto an illusion, a mirage! The real Melissa had rejected her. The real 
Melissa had left. The real Melissa had become a murderer, The real 
Meloissa was lost to her... She should just forget everything and carry 
on with her life, fulfilling her duty.

But she couldn&#39;t let go.

The revelation hit her with the force of a physical blow.

She couldn&#39;t let go.

She still needed her.

She still wanted her.

She still loved her with all that she was...

A small, bitter smile tugged at her lips while tears were still 
streaming down her face. How fitting! The rich, spoiled brat who fell 
for a cold-hearted murderer.The princess-witch - she inwardly snorted - 
in love with a vengeful fallen angel.

Cursed destinies. Doomed passion.

Under the worried gazes of all her officers, she said in an almost 
inaudible voice &quot;I know... I know she wouldn&#39;t, because... I love 
her...&quot; Her smile widened at this admission, although this smile talked 
about anything but happiness. Lie and truth so tightly knotted that they 
were undistinguishable.

The silence in the command room was almost deafening. Everyone was 
shocked, save for Karirin. Mardukas, for his part, was gaping openly.

Thessa kept her eyes stubbornly glued to the deck. Inside of her, a firm 
resolution had formed. She would do everything in her power to retrieve 
Melissa.

Mardukas quickly recovered and said, regretfully &quot;Under the present 
circumstances, you&#39;ll understand that we&#39;ll have to inform the proper 
hierarchy. You will probably be temporarily suspended of your 
functions...&quot;

Thessa nodded, not really listening.

She would do anything, no matter what.

yeah it&#39;s hurting me
morphing me
and forcing me to strive

to be endlessly
caving in
and dreaming of my love

because I want it now
I want it now
give me your heart and your soul
I&#39;m not breaking down
I&#39;m breaking out
that&#39;s when she&#39;ll lose control

and I want you now
I want you now
I feel my heart implode
and I&#39;m breaking out
escaping now
feeling my faith grow old

With a grunt, Melissa threw the limp body of a sentinel in a trash bin 
and checked one more time that her path was now clear. At first, she had 
just intended to take pictures of the site she had discovered no long 
ago, thanks to her contacts, that was a secret hideout of whatever 
organisation Radek Vaszclav and Urs Grechtner were part of. It was a 
usine localised in the industrial zone of Budapest. In the few days she 
had spent spying on this place, she had seen a flurry of activity. 
Trucks going in and out endlessly, techies running around in a frenzy 
and a very heavy security.To say that she was curious about whatever 
they were doing in there would be the understatement of the year. She 
was sure it was somehow related to what had happened in Columbia. But 
then she saw HIM. Radek Vaszclav, or Silent, as he was called. 
Apparently accompanying some VIP of theirs. All thoughts of prudence had 
then flown right through the window, leaving only the burning desire for 
vengeance.

She knew she was pushing her luck. But. What did she have to lose that 
HE hadn&#39;t already taken? Besides, it was such a golden opportunity to 
pay him back. She couldn&#39;t possibly let it pass.

She slipped unnoticed behind several other guards, her dark outfit 
helping her blending in the shadows. She finally reached the main 
building were Silent had disappeared. There was of course no way she 
could enter by the same door, but... She lifted her head, studying the 
walls of the factory and spotted what she was looking for. The window 
was at least three-storey high, but she was confident she could climb up 
there despite her still healing ribs, thanks to the adjoining wall and 
the gutter.

By the time she reached the damn window, she was panting heavily and her 
arms felt like lead. Thank god for small miracles, the window was open 
and after a quick check, she lost no time slipping in. The climb had 
been more taxing than expected and her ribs were a bitch, but the 
promise of future vengeance was better than any analgesic at this point. 
Once inside, she took time to catch her breath while examining her 
surroundings. She was in a small office of some sort. A small desk of 
old brown wood, a battered chair, a very old computer and building plans 
were cramping the place. Manilla folders scattered everywhere. 
Obviously, it hadn&#39;t been visited in a very long time, judging by the 
amount of dust and cobwebs... Although her lungs disagreed, it was a 
good thing. That meant she was relatively safe here. It was unlikely 
someone would suddenly barge in. Well, if Luck kept smiling to her 
anyway.

She headed to the door but froze all of a sudden.

Wait! Building plans? She backtracked to the desk and here there were. 
Plans of the entire building, floor by floor. She couldn&#39;t get luckier, 
could she? She quickly memorized them and set off again, hunting for her 
prey. Silent as a panther, she ambled down a metallic stairway. The 
sound of heavy footsteps alerted her. She quickly found shadows to hide 
in, unsheathing a long.thin knife. Soon enough two guards showed up, 
walking lazily past her never noticing her. She slipped behind them and 
brutally stabbed one in the neck, then, in a clean single swipe, opened 
the other&#39;s throat who had unknowingly turned to his death in his 
surprise. Blood splashed her face and the walls as he fell bonelessly at 
her feet, strangled gurgles being the last sounds he would ever utter.

She dragged the two corpses out of sight, hiding them behind crates. 
Then she went on the path she had memorized and which would lead her to 
the main hangar, and hopefully, to Silent... Finally she arrived to the 
main hangar accessing by a discreet office door to the working area 
indicated on the blueprints. The working area, situated about 20 meters 
below was literally swarming like an ant&#39;s&#39;s nest. Thankfully, no one 
paid her any attention. It was between 150 and 200 meters long and at 
least 100 m large. Workers in white overalls were bent over delicate 
pieces of electronics, others were at the command of other engines. She 
squinted and upon seing the pieces of electronics, was almost sure they 
were part of the engine she had briefly examined back in Columbia. Her 
gaze wandered to the far end of the hangar and that&#39;s when she spotted 
Him.

Silent. Pure murderous hatred filled her crimson eyes. She knew blood as 
red as her eyes would spill tonight. Finally! She&#39;d make him pay!

He was conversing with the previous VRPs. Urs Grechtner was there too. 
Several guards were positioned all around. She realized she would never 
be able to reach them. She wracked her brain for a solution. There had 
to be a way! She wasn&#39;t afraid to die in the process, but she just 
wanted to make sure she wouldn&#39;t go to hell alone. She had to bring 
Silent along, at the very least.

For her fallen comrades. For Olafson&#39;s legs, for O&#39;Brien...

For lost opportunities...

She backed down in the alley she just came from, retrieving one of the 
dead guard&#39;s assault rifle. She had to try. Even if she wasn&#39;t the big 
shot Kurz was, she was still a well trained soldier She checked again 
her surroundings, making sure no one would find her. She dropped to her 
knees and aimed carefully, steadying her breath. Sweat trickled from her 
forehead, she knew she had only one chance at this.

Inspire. Expire.

Inspire. Expire.

Her fingers slowly pulling the trigger to the limit.

Inspire. Expire. Block.

BKAM BKAM BKAM

The sound of gunshots echoed in the old paved streets of the Hungarian 
capital city, almost overcoming the hammering of her heart in her chest. 
Hadn&#39;t she been already out of breath, she&#39;d have cursed her luck to 
every nine hells. Why, why in the fucking world couldn&#39;t things just go 
her way?

BKAM BKAM

She ducked in a nearby street. Close! The last two shots had been too 
close! She&#39;d have to find a way to get rid of her pursuivers. Fast!

BKAM BKAM BKAM BKAM

She replied, not really caring if she hit anyone but effectively forcing 
her pursuivers to hide too. At least, no large car would be able to 
follow her in these narrow streets. However, she was aware of the fact 
that she needed a vehicule if she wanted to escape them. A motorbike, 
anything! She looked around frantically. Then she saw the Traban hiding 
in the shadows maybe fifty meters away from her. She sighed in dismay. 
Conveniently placed fast sport cars could only be found in movies, it 
seemed. Well, it would have to do. At least this car would be easy to 
steal...

She hit the driver&#39;s window with her gun and reached down to open the 
door. She lost no time in sliding in and looking for the power cables 
under the steering-wheel, she could very well hear the fast approaching 
steps and shouts. Luckily, the Traban had obviously been very well kept 
and it started out quite easilly, if loudly.

She tore her way along the street, keeping her head as low as possible 
under the shower of bullets aimed at her, since the car walls were as 
thin as paper. She thankfully quickly found a lateral street and fifteen 
minutes later, she was quite confident she had managed to lose them.

Damnit! She hit the steering wheel with both hands in rage! How could 
things have gone so horribly wrong? He had been at her complete mercy, a 
breath away from death. But no! Just as she was about to seal his fate, 
he looked up, saw her and with inhuman speed and reflexes dove forward 
over one of the VRPs, a young man with very light hair, dodging the 
bullet from a mere millimeter. The bullet hit some gaz bottle behind 
which exploded, momentarily blinding her. Then she&#39;d been forced to back 
off while Silent and the others took cover and started firing at her. 
She&#39;d had no choice but run away.

&quot;How could I let such a golden opportunity pass ?&quot; She loudly berated 
herself. Now Silent would be on his guard.Worse, he would certainly look 
for her.

Melissa abandonned the battered car in a halleyway. She didn&#39;t need cops 
asking her why her car was filled with so many bullet impacts. Looking 
around her warily, she gingerly made her way to the subway. After a 
quick scan, she decided nothing was suspect and went to the lockers, 
stepping around torched beggars reeking of trash and frelated vodka. She 
opened one of the lockers and pulled a sport bag out of it. She quickly 
pulled cloths out of it and proceeded to change. A thick pullover of 
creamy wool went over her bulletproof jacket and tight black top. A long 
grey skirt replaced the navy blue cargo pants. Black leather high-heeled 
boots replaced the rangers. A thick anthracite coat made of velour and a 
grey b&#130;ret completed the outfit. Throwing dagues went inside the boots 
and she slid a Glock 19 in her inside holster. Finally, she withdrew a 
few rolls of cash from the locker, which she hid in her coat. She had 
several hides like that were scattered through the city. Once set, she 
locked the locker and got on the first subway heading for the old city.

She never noticed the two shadows following her.
