<h1>Bulletproof (part 2 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../fullmetal/index.html">Full Metal Panic</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fade.html">Fade</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../fullmetal/bulletproof-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>This chapter contains some graphical scenes of violence, although I did 
my best to refrain myself and remain as sober as possible, without 
deteriorating the atmosphere I wanted to create. But the thought that 
everything I could write, couldn&#39;t be worse that what one can imagine, 
made it easier to keep my descriptions to a minimum (yeah, okay, it&#39;s 
also &#39;cause I&#39;m a lazy butt)...

Well, you&#39;ve been warned...

The command bridge was usually a quiet place. Some would say frigid. But 
this time, it was in a frenzy, mostly due to its captain. It was 
seriously worrying the others officers. That was the second time that 
they saw her grey eyes have this cold, unsettling, almost soulless gaze. 
On the other hand, she had never been that frantic, not even when Gaul 
had taken over the ship. She was pacing back and forth. The mix of this 
two things was most disquieting.

&quot;When is the satellite supposed to cover the area?&quot; She barked.

&quot;In fifteen minutes, ma&#39;am.&quot; Answered dutifully the transmission 
officer. He suppressed a shudder. It was already the tenth time she 
asked this. That was plain creepy! The next question would be...

&quot;And when should they have sent teir security call?&quot;

&quot;Three hours ago, ma&#39;am.&quot; - Bingo! -

&quot;Still no answer?&quot;

&quot;None, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, keep trying.&quot;

He cringed at her tone of voice.

She finally sat back, reluctantly, and chewed her lower lip. She wanted 
to scream in frustration. First, this mission had lasted longer than 
expected.

And now, they had lost all communications with them. What was going on? 
It was supposed to be a routine mission.

Sosuke and Weber had been called back in emergency, although they 
wouldn&#39;t be on board before several hours. She rubbed her temples. This 
was taking too long, but she couldn&#39;t send troops blindly either.

The major Karirin chose this moment to enter the command bridge, as calm 
and professional as usual.

&quot;Ah, major! How were the negociations with the columbian government?&quot;

&quot;Not very good, I&#39;m afraid, captain. You, of course, know that, even if 
most of the governments find us very usefull at times, provided that we 
keep a low profile, they will never officially recognize Mithrill as a 
legal military organisation. This, because they don&#39;t have any control 
over us, and don&#39;t know who has... It means we are relatively free to 
act as we see fit, but it also means that, in case of problem, we are on 
our own. Helping us would be a blow to their own military craft.&quot;

&quot;And we know how the people would see this...&quot; Added the young woman 
darkly. She hadn&#39;t expected much of this negociations anyway.

The major nodded. &quot;... Weakness. And I won&#39;t even mention the countries 
that consider Mithrill as a mere terrorist organisation.

&quot;Which, in a way, we are, aren&#39;t we?&quot; With a deep sigh, she closed her 
eyes and leaned back in her chair, as the old warrior remained silent. 
Her last conversation with Melissa echoed in her head. The De Danan, the 
A.Ss were weapons. Everything depended on who wielded them. The last 
confrontation with Gaul had been a painful reminder.

Melissa...

&quot;Ma&#39;am, we just received the pictures from the satellite&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mr. Oliveira. Project them, please.&quot;

She felt her heart stop.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Melissa stiffled a cry of pain. She ached all over. To follow the drug 
dealers had been a HUGE mistake. It had costed O&#39;Brien his life. She was 
unaware of Olafson&#39;s whererabouts, however... Maybe, he had been able to 
flee. If she hadn&#39;t been hurting so much, she would have laughed at her 
own stupidity, so typical of her to play the heroine like that...

But there she was, cuffed to a young tree, beaten down by some jerk.

- POW - His large fist connected one more time with her sternum.

She coughed, unable to catch her breath, spitting blood at the same 
time. &#39;...&#39;probably broke the same ribs. Shit! They&#39;d just healed a 
month ago!&#39; She had the time to think before another blow landed in her 
face, finally sending her in the blissful realm of unconsciousness.

Some time later, her eyes flutterred open. She had lost any sense of 
where she was and what she was doing there. She moved a bit and a flash 
of sharp pain ran through her like a lightning bolt, remembering her of 
the reason of her state. &quot;Oh! Fuck! That hurts!!!&quot; she gasped. At the 
same time she wondered if she was still alive. Wheter that or she was in 
hell!

She groaned and shut her eyes thightly, praying whatever god who&#39;d heard 
her to end her torment. She didn&#39;t care how. After some agonizing 
minutes, she relaxed back as the pain finally dulled. She could now feel 
the rain pourring on her. She was lying in the mud, at the feet of the 
tree she had been previously cuffed to.

&#39;...&#39;heard that&#39;s excellent for the skin...&#39; She thought ironically.

She didn&#39;t want to move at all, but... She was cold! Oh so cold... A 
glance at herself and she knew one of the reason. Her clothes were torn.

That wasn&#39;t a good thing, she decided, but prefered not to dwell on the 
subject any longer. Right now, if she didn&#39;t do anything, she knew that 
she would die. She looked around her. The mercenaries had apparently 
left precipitaly.

She gritted her teeth and proceeded to stand up. She slowly brought her 
legs under her and pushed with her arms. The motion cut her breath and 
made her heart skip a beat or two. Her stomach reacted violently too and 
she couldn&#39;t stop herself to throw up, causing new burning chains of 
pain in her whole being. This time, she was sure she was going to die. 
Eventually, her abused organs calmed down and she avidly gulped some 
much needed air. When the dizziness that clouded her mind cleared a 
little, she was pleased to see that she had managed to stay on her hands 
and knees.

She grabbed the trunk of the tree and with a determined look, hauled 
herself upright. She then held on the tree for dear life, waiting for 
the expected pain and vertigo to subside again.

Between gasps, a grim smile appeared on her face. &#39;They haven&#39;t killed 
me! I&#39;ll show&#39;em what a mistake it was!!!&#39;

Admittedly, she was as good as dead, in her state, in the middle of the 
jungle and without any weapon. But in her current state of mind, she 
didn&#39;t care. She was still alive, and that was all that counted. That 
and her revenge.

&quot;I&#39;ll never give up, &#39;gonna fight &#39;till the end... &#39;ll make &#39;em regret 
to be born at all&quot; She growled. &quot;... I&#39;ve promised her I&#39;ll respect my 
contract, &#39;nd heavens be damned, I will!&quot;

With that, she released her hold and ,slowly, like a drunken woman, 
headed back to the remains of her camp.&#39;It&#39;s not that far... Only three 
kilometers...&quot; She stubbornly ignored the vehement protests of her body.

----------------------------------------------------------

&#39;... She&#39;s always come back... She&#39;s always come back... She&#39;s always 
come back...&#39;

Thessa was repeating this sentence like a mantra for the past three 
hours. Since she had seen the pictures that the satellite had taken. 
Everyone on the bridge had been shocked, of course. But Thessa couldn&#39;t 
even begin to describe her feelings, they were beyond words. Actually, 
she had almost fainted.

The pictures were obcenely precise, showing all too clearly the blown 
A.S. and the wrecked bodies of her men. Melissa was nowhere to be seen. 
While it gave her hope, she knew that it didn&#39;t mean much either. She 
could be hiding under the green roof of the forest, or she could have 
been captured... Or...

Thessa shook her head. She refused to imagine what else could have 
happened.

&#39;She has always come back...&#39; As if it could exorcise the little movie 
that kept on playing behind her eyes. Where bullets tore the flesh of 
her beloved, leaving an empty shell in their wake. Livid eyes staring 
blindly at the sky, forever.

A sob escaped her lips before she could choke it down.

&quot;Excuse me a moment...&quot; She managed to say before she all but fled the 
command bridge. Her subordinates watched her retreat with even more 
worried and inquisitive looks.

Once in the hallway, she simply collapsed on her knees. She let her 
tears flow freely as terror and anger engulfed her. She had never felt 
like that.

It was as if a cold hand was squizzing her heart until it exploded. 
Never had she thought that loving someone could bring so much pain.

Waiting was an agony.

She usually felt so useless in this moments. But in this particular 
case, it was simply unbearable! She hated to wait! But that was all she 
could do, while the rescue team headed for Columbia.

&quot;Too slow! How much more time will it take?&quot; But she knew that the team, 
as fast as it was flying, wouldn&#39;t reach the campsite before another 
hour or so.

She had such a bad feeling...

&#39;Too late...&#39;

Again this voice! It had appeared shortly after the departure of the 
rescue team. This silly, unwelcomed voice... Up until now, she had made 
her best to ignore it. She knew she had done everything she could, as 
fast as it was possible...

But...

When the De Danan hadn&#39;t received any news from the Meilssa, the 
head-officer of the mission, her first impulse had been to send troops 
at once. Melissa was never late. But as a captain, she couldn&#39;t afford 
to react impulsively. She couldn&#39;t endanger her men by sending them in a 
possible trap. Even if Melissa was in trouble. It was her duty, her 
responsability. It required of her to remain calm and poised at all 
times. Everybody counted on her to make the cold, rational decisions.

The hard decisions...

She wanted to screw all this bloody shit!!!

&#39;Too late...&#39; It whispered again.

She shook her head furiously and battered the little voice down. She 
wouldn&#39;t believe it. She couldn&#39;t... She stood back and wiped her tears. 
&quot;Melissa isn&#39;t dead, she always comes back! She has to...&quot; Her voice 
broke.

&quot;... I didn&#39;t have the time to tell her...&quot;

&#39;Too late...&#39;

--------------------------------------------------

Melissa stumbled once more on a treacherous root. And once again, 
hissing in pain, she managed to recover her balance. At least, it had 
stopped to rain, but the ground was still very slippery. Her movements 
also were becoming more and more uncontrolled. Her mind was fuzzy and 
she had difficulties to keep her eyes open. She knew she had gone by her 
limits long ago, but kept on walking anyway.

&#39;I must not fall! That&#39;d be the end!&#39;

However, Fate or Lady Luck weren&#39;t on her side at all today. She saw too 
late tha she was on the edge of a hill. Her left footslid on the mantel 
of dead leaves taht covered her path and she fell head first. She rolled 
helplessly all the way down.

When she finally came to a stop, she was lying flat on her back. She 
began to cough and laugh at the same time. That was a sad, defeated 
sound.

She stared up at the canopey, so far above her.

&quot;So... This is how it ends?&quot;

It was more a statement than a question. She knew she wouldn&#39;t go 
further. She briefly wondered if her body would be retrieved at all.

Then, at the corner of her right eye, she noticed something unusual in a 
jungle. A boot. Curoius, she let her gaze wander along the leg it 
protected, up until it landed on the face of one of her comrades. Her 
eyes widened when she recognised him. Takeda... She was about to call 
him when she saw the tiny holes in his chest.

Dead.

His body had obviously fallen here too.

&#39;Poor lad...&#39; She thought. &#39;He always made the squad laugh with his 
habit of carrying his digital camera all the time... - to show his 
future grandchildren what kind of life he led when he was young - he 
said. He didn&#39;t even had a wife yet!&#39;

Suddenly, something clicked in her tired mind.

&#39;Camera?&#39;

With unbidden determination, she forced her body to crawl to reach 
Takeda&#39;s. She emptied his pockets until she found what she was looking 
for. She sighed in relief. It hadn&#39;t been damaged! She smiled genuinely 
and thanked her fallen companion.

She had one important thing left to do.

With some more curses, she eased herself in a sitting position, her back 
pressed against Takeda&#39;s curled body. The she set the camera on a stone 
nearby and hit the record button.

&quot;Sergent major Melissa Mao, last report on mission KTP-0358... It should 
be given as fast as possible to the captain of the Thuata De Danan...&quot; A 
new serie of coughs interupted her. &quot;This report is to be classified 
secret level A...&quot;

She took a long breath to help clarify her mind before continuing. &quot;On 
the sixth of february, around 1400, local time, our campsite was 
attacked by an unknown force, later identified as the mercenaries hired 
by the drugdealers. All the A.Ss were destoyed by portable missils and 
all the men were mercilessly shot down.&quot; She took in a ragged intake of 
air. To focus was becoming really difficult.

&quot;As far as I know, only three of us managed to survive. Corporals 
O&#39;Brien and Olafson and myself. We tried to contact the De Danan, 
without success. We decided then to follow our enemies in order to 
discover why our A.Ss sensors had been unable to detect them, and if it 
had something to do with the dysfunction of our radios. We soon made it 
to their temporary camp, which was situated only three of four 
kilometers away from ours!&quot;

Melissa paused, reliving the events. &quot;By that time, it was already dark 
and the mercenaries clearly didn&#39;t intend to travel by night... We 
waited for them to stop celebrating their victory. Then, when everything 
was quiet, we slipped in their camp.We had noticed a different tent 
among the others.Everybody was so plastered that nobody noticed us, or 
so we thought... Anyway, in the tent, we found a unknown engine. It 
seemed to be powered up by the same kind of generators our A.Ss have...&quot; 
Followed a precise description and a list of technical informations she 
had been able to gather.

&quot;We decided to destroy it. O&#39;Brien and me were waiting outside, keeping 
an eye on the mercenaries, while Olafson, expert in explosives, was 
preparing the fireworks. That&#39;s when a man irrupted next to me, 
seemingly out of nowhere. He was about two meters long and almost as 
large. Caucasiam type, blond hair, green eyes and tribal tattoos all 
over his back and arms. I learned later that he was called &#39;Silent&#39; by 
the bunch of criminals he commanded. And indeed, he was as silent as 
death itself, and as deadly. He sent me flying with a single kick. 
Sprawled on the ground, I watched this monster grab O&#39;Brien&#39;s neck and, 
as simply as if he was opening a bottle, break his neck.&quot; She shuddered 
at the memory. &quot;Then he turned to Olafson who had just exited the tent. 
Olafson&#39;s a good fighter, but there, he was clearly outclassed. I came 
to my feet, charged and tackled him. Then I ordered to Olafson to run 
away, because the whole camp was waking up. That&#39;s the last time I saw 
him. I, of course, intended to do the same. As I ran, I heard an 
explosion behind me, so, I assume that Olafson was able to destroy the 
engine, but I can&#39;t insure that. If you see him, though, congratulate 
him for me. Unluckily for me, I chose the wrong way and got 
caught...They... tortured me and finally left me as dead.&quot; She finally 
briefly related how she had ended at the bottom of this hill.

She let the camera run a little while, clearly hesitating about 
something. Then she appeared to reach a decision. Her face softened and 
she spoke again. &quot;Thessa, I&#39;ve still something to tell you... It... It&#39;s 
kindda private... This is something I&#39;m not good at... But... But I 
wanted you to know that I... I love you. I&#39;m in love with you... I 
realize that it&#39;s most unfair to you, but please... Allow a dying woman 
to ease her soul...&quot;

Her body felt numb. That wasn&#39;t such a bad thing, since she didn&#39;t ache 
so much anymore. Curiously, the world around her seemed to become 
brighter, it was beautiful. A peaceful smile bloomed on her face as she 
went on. &quot;Please, don&#39;t hate me for this... That&#39;s why I really had to 
leave. It was driving me nuts... But, somehow, it also filled me with 
joy... I know you&#39;re not like that, but I couldn&#39;t control my 
feelings...&quot;

Her eyes closed and her last words came in a whisper.

&quot;Please forgive me... I love you...&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, but I was also listening to Korn and System of a down, and that&#39;s 
the result. I&#39;m tempted to let it at that, although I have enough 
material for a suite. What do you think?
