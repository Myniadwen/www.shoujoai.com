The Picnic

Yukino jumped on Maho and started tickling her mercilessly.  The two 
laughed and laughed, rolling over in the grass and feeling the sun on 
their faces.  In any situation, Yukino loved to dominate and having Maho 
in this powerless position beneath her was quite exhilarating.  She 
didn&#39;t want to stop, even as Maho became breathless, until...

&quot;Hey, you lesbians over there, the bell&#39;s ringing!&quot;  

At the sound of Aya&#39;s voice, both Maho blushed a deep shade of red, 
while Yukino just froze.  

That certainly was an interesting way to look at it.  

***

Maho stared off into the distance as a light breeze blew over the grass.  
In spite of all her resistance, she was glad she had finally given in 
and agreed to participate in the play.  It had given her many more 
opportunities to be with Yukino, from the times when they were running 
from Aya to the many rehearsals.  She feigned disinterest and 
opposition, of course, but it was only because she wanted Yukino to come 
running after her, to catch her, to dominate her...

Suddenly Maho became conscious of the fact that Yukino hadn&#39;t spoken for 
several minutes.  

&quot;Say.  Why did you suddenly decide to do the play?  You were so against 
it in the beginning.&quot;  

With a thoughtful expression, Yukino explained that the play had given 
her something to do besides study.  She continued to explain that since 
Arima had a life apart from her and school, she felt that she needed one 
as well.  

&quot;You just hate to lose,&quot; Maho teased.  

&quot;I think it has to be this way.  Besides, Arima loves me.&quot;  

Why is she bringing that up now?  

&quot;What?  What are you bragging for?!  You are bragging!&quot; Maho yelled, 
grabbing Yukino by the collar.  

Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said that.  After all, I&#39;m in love too, with an 
imaginary dentist...

Yukino panicked and defended herself, then calmed down and said softly, 
&quot;Arima&#39;s world is deeper than mine.  I think he would take all the 
burden onto himself, rather than make me worry and suffer, since I&#39;m so 
naive.  That&#39;s what I thought.  So, I decided I&#39;d build my own world for 
myself.  I like being able to depend on Arima, but I don&#39;t want to let 
him spoil me and get lazy because of it.&quot;  

God, she&#39;s beautiful.  

&quot;And that&#39;s why Arima responds only to you, of all the girls out there.&quot;  

&quot;Hey, you laughed!  What?!  I&#39;m always the one talking!  It&#39;s not fair!&quot;  

Yukino grabbed onto Maho&#39;s shoulder and started shaking her back and 
forth

&quot;You talk about yourself, too!&quot;  

&quot;No way!&quot; Maho shouted.  

There&#39;s no way I&#39;d do anything to stop you, you&#39;re so cute when you 
pretend to be mad.  

&quot;Oh, come on!  Talk!&quot;

Yukino jumped on Maho, knocking her down into the grass, and began 
tickling her mercilessly.  Maho laughed breathlessly.  

&quot;No, stop!&quot;  

The tickling went on as Maho savored the feeling of surrendering to 
Yukino&#39;s hands and body.  She hoped her delight wasn&#39;t too obvious, but 
she could hardly hope to hide it.  Yukino&#39;s actions had been so sudden 
and so enjoyable.  Maho laughed and laughed.  

&quot;Hey, you lesbians over there, the bell&#39;s ringing!&quot;  

Maho blushed profusely.  Had that been only and offhand comment, or did 
Aya have a certain &quot;writer&#39;s intuition&quot; about her?
