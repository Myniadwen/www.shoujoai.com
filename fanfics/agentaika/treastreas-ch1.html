<h1>The Treasure After the Treasure</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../agentaika/index.html">Agent Aika</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/grandmoff.html">GrandMoff</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      Eri hadn&#39;t expected everything to go smoothly on their mission, 
and it hadn&#39;t.  Almost all her family&#39;s equipment was still in one 
piece, but she--her own adorable body!--had been knocked out at some 
point, along with almost everyone who&#39;d come with her.  The 
treasure-hunting club&#39;s advisor, Ms. Risako had been a traitor, and 
she&#39;d been equipped with a few interesting gadgets that had made success 
difficult.  Karen, the school&#39;s mysterious beauty, had been a clone, 
complete with false memories and a host of guardian sisters (including a 
giant one).

      Lucky that Aika had been with them.  Regina Eri--the yacht, 
Beluga--the submarine, and Sumeragi Aika--the C-class salvager had all 
exceeded her expectations.  Aika was the most impressive, though.  She 
was still a 16-year-old, so she had a certain naivete, but she was 
clever, observant, loyal, and strong.  She was a skilled fighter and 
pilot as well.

      Eri and Aika had always been at each other&#39;s throats for a lot of 
reasons.  But not long ago, Eri had realized that the main reason was 
that she was attracted to Aika.  Attracted--was that strong enough?  
Could it be obsessed?  In love with?

      The wave motion under the yacht was normally soothing enough to 
put Eri to sleep.  But tonight was different.  Just a few hours earlier, 
they&#39;d been under the ocean, solving mysteries.  How could she sleep?

      Eri half-sat up, leaning on her elbows.  The cabin wasn&#39;t 
completely dark.  She could make out her roommate&#39;s figure.  There was 
Aika; and as usual, she had been very mobile in her sleep, to the point 
of mostly undressing herself.  Again, Eri patted herself on the back for 
making such good sleeping arrangements.  Just having Aika near felt 
wonderful.  She always smelled good and made cute sounds in her sleep, 
plus her presence made Eri feel safer.

      Aika thrashed around a little.  She mumbled something Eri couldn&#39;t 
quite make out.  Too curious to resist, the class president quietly got 
out of bed and went to Aika.  &quot;Eri...chan...&quot; Aika murmured.

      Oh, I&#39;m in her dreams!  Eri grinned and leaned closer.

      &quot;...baka,&quot; Aika finished.

      &quot;You little jerk!&quot; Eri whispered.  She brushed a few strands of 
hair from her friend&#39;s face.

      &quot;...chu,&quot; Aika muttered.

      Eri&#39;s heart stopped.  Was Aika dreaming of kissing her?  What 
other explanation could there be?  Well, there could be a lot of others, 
she admitted to herself.  But if that was it...Eri knelt, hoping to hear 
more.

      &quot;Suki,&quot; the sleeping blonde said.

      Eri couldn&#39;t take any more.  Aika looked so gorgeous--cute, 
capable, vulnerable--if she was dreaming about kissing Eri, how could 
Eri miss that chance?  She leaned down and softly pressed her lips to 
Aika&#39;s.

      Oh, that felt too good!  Whether it was instinctive or a dream 
response or something else, Aika kissed back gently and coyly.

      Eri used all her self-control to keep from taking Aika in her arms 
and doing what she longed to do to her.  The blonde salvager was so soft 
and hot and fragrant.  Of course, if Aika woke, she&#39;d probably beat Eri 
black and blue, but wasn&#39;t the reward worth the risk?

      &quot;I knew it was that kind of club.&quot;

      Her blood chilled, Eri opened her eyes.  She found herself staring 
directly at an  awake Sumeragi Aika.  The lithe trouble-maker looked 
amused, but also something else.  She had Eri caught in her gaze.

      &quot;You were dreaming,&quot; the brunette heiress stammered.  &quot;I came over 
to...&quot;

      &quot;I see.&quot;  Aika put her arms around Eri.  &quot;Come on in, then.&quot;  She 
pulled Eri into the bed beside her.

      Aika&#39;s legs wrapped around Eri&#39;s legs, her arms going around Eri&#39;s 
middle.  In moments, she was snoring quietly.

      She didn&#39;t really wake up, Eri realized.  She doesn&#39;t mean this 
the way I want her to mean it.

      Not yet, anyway.

      And that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not the happiest girl in the world right 
now.  I know now; I can approach her.  Maybe she&#39;ll love me someday.  
Maybe someday soon.
