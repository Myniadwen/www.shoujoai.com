<h1>Historical Context</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../bluedrop/index.html">Blue Drop</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Yui sometimes wondered what people thought when it
happened. The spaceships of the Azume filling the sky,
the beautiful women descending with tranquil smiled
then... exploding as they sacrificed themselves as
living weapons. Did the people there know this was the
end of their way of life? Did they know that
everything had changed?

For the last 1000 years the Azume had ruled over the
Earth, working through proxies in the civilian
government as well as directly interfering. They lived
and walked among us every day, these silver haired,
blue eyed beauties, but no one really understood why
they had came here or what, ultimately, they really
wanted.

Shaking her head Yui got up from where the black
haired girl had been sitting on the shore, staring out
at the sea. Thinking about such things wouldn&#39;t help
them, and she had things to do. The blue eyed girl
clambered over rocks as she headed up the road, seeing
the rubble of a ruined Azume ship off in the distance,
the wreckage of a skyscraper nearby. The world was
littered with sights like this, the ancient aftermath
of that incredibly short war.

&quot;Hey,&quot; one of the sentries nodded, sitting with a
casual air outside the old office building they called
home. His relaxed pose was contradicted by his wary
eyes, and a pistol sat concealed but within easy
reach, just in case. &quot;Mari wants you,&quot; he noted.

&quot;All the girls want me,&quot; Yui nodded back, smirking.

He rolled his eyes, &quot;Seriously, she wants to talk to
you and the other cell commanders.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Yui said as she went in, then headed for the
stairwell and went up two floors. &quot;So,&quot; she said
quietly as she entered the room, men and women working
and talking busily, &quot;what&#39;s so important you had to
get me here.&quot;

Another half Azume like her, Mari was a quiet but
pretty girl, her eyes having the same alien look her&#39;s
own did. &quot;I think we may have made a breakthrough,&quot;
she smiled as she pushed black hair back, &quot;studying
documents predating the invasion, we may know why...&quot;

Yui&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Why the Azume came?&quot;

Mari smiled slightly, &quot;We think so.&quot; She took a deep
breath, &quot;You all know about the Azume&#39;s silver hair,
blue eyes and pale skin...&quot;

&quot;They all look sort of alike, too,&quot; Shouko noted
quietly. She had once been in line to be turned into a
weapon to neutralize left over ordinance from the
Azume/human war, and was rescued by Yui before they
could kill her. Now she was a member of their
resistance, helping fight the Azume and their willing
human collaborators.

&quot;In the early days of the Azume&#39;s arrival, that not
only did they take over but they...&quot; Mari blushed,
&quot;took advantage of human women.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Yui smiled wryly.

In fact, that was something of a understatement. The
Azume had been like kids in a candy store, seducing
willing and occasionally some not so willing young
women. Whole areas had been declared their personal
territory, no men allowed in, and any woman found
wandering there was considered fair game.

&quot;Obviously, we&#39;re exotic to them with our various hair
colors and other features, but there may have been a
more important reason,&quot; Mari said briskly.

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; one of the men in their group wondered,
his brown hair falling rakishly into his eyes.

&quot;I believe the Azume are suffering the long term
effects of inbreeding.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Shouko blinked, sitting up in surprise.

Mari looked embarrassed, &quot;I started suspecting
something when I saw the Azume&#39;s version of a ancient
sex manual... it&#39;s sort of their version of the Kama
Sutra.&quot; She turned and fished around her desk, &quot;Here,
look at this.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Yui noted, looking at two women in a
imaginative pose.

&quot;Get your head out of the gutter,&quot; Mari rolled her
eyes, &quot;and think about it.&quot;

Mari looked at the picture, a black haired woman
twisting gracefully as a redhead played with her
nipples and frowned, &quot;What am I supposed to be
seeing?&quot;

&quot;Hair colors,&quot; Mari sighed.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Shouko realized, &quot;Azume don&#39;t have different
hair colors!&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Mari nodded, &quot;the original this document
was copied from is very old, and at one time the Azume
had a broader degree of physical variety.&quot;

&quot;It could be this is fiction,&quot; Yui pointed out, &quot;in
mangas the creators used hair colors that never
existed in nature...&quot;

&quot;Possibly,&quot; Mari conceded, &quot;but we&#39;ve found other
documents that back this up.&quot;

&quot;So, why inbreeding?&quot; Yui asked.

&quot;I&#39;m no geneticist,&quot; Mari conceded, &quot;but I talked to
several medical scientists. It&#39;s possible that the
Azume didn&#39;t evolve into their current appearance, but
instead may be suffering a genetic defect similar to
albinism.&quot;

&quot;So why do they need us?&quot; Shouko asked.

&quot;I think,&quot; Mari was careful to state that she was
speculating, &quot;they want to use human DNA to undo the
genetic damage, or possibly to simply add a greater
variety to their gene pool.&quot;

&quot;So how does this help us?&quot; a young man had to burst
out, &quot;We can&#39;t stop girls from having sex with Azume!&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but understanding at least part of their
motivations is a good thing,&quot; Yui pointed out. She
gave Mari a admiring smile, &quot;Keep pursuing this line
of investigation, Mari. It could lead to more
discoveries.&quot;

&quot;And where are you going?&quot; Shouko asked curiously as
Yui headed to the door.

&quot;I need some air,&quot; Yui answered evasively as she went
out the door.

Mari sighed as Yui left, &quot;I was hoping I could ask her
to question Misato for me...&quot;

&quot;Why not ask her yourself?&quot; a scraggly young man
asked.

Mari rolled her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m not Misato&#39;s lover.&quot;

The home Yui had set up wasn&#39;t far from their base of
operations, but you had to know where to look in the
warren of abandoned buildings to find it. She
navigated the maze with the ease of long experience,
eventually reaching the section of building she had
declared her house.

&quot;I&#39;m home,&quot; Yui called softly.

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; Misato answered, the blue eyed woman
smiling warmly in welcome. Her hair was black because
of the dye, otherwise she would have looked truly
unearthly with silver hair in the sunlight streaming
in the windows.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Yui sighed as they kissed lingeringly, the
taller woman pushing back Yui&#39;s shorter hair to caress
her cheek.

Misato had made a hard choice, defecting from the
Azume to be with Yui even knowing the fear and
suspicion that the resistance viewed her with. Now she
lived a quiet life with her lover, but despite joining
their side Misato refused to divulge her people&#39;s
secrets... or at least, doing so very rarely.

&quot;What would you like with dinner?&quot; Misato asked as she
bustled around the kitchen, long black hair shining.

&quot;Hold on,&quot; Yui put her hand on the taller woman&#39;s
shoulder, &quot;there&#39;s something I wanted to ask you...&quot;
Sitting down at the low table they talked as she
sketched in Mari&#39;s theories on the Azume and why they
came. Finally she looked at Misato, &quot;What do you
think?&quot;

Misato poured them both tea, her expression oddly
unreadable. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she admitted finally,
&quot;it&#39;s possible, certainly, but no one in my generation
has been informed as to why we first visited Earth.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t learn it in history class?&quot; Yui wondered.

&quot;We&#39;re less... concerned with history than your
people,&quot; Misato conceded.

Yui looked across the table at her, and once more was
struck by the immense gap between their two species. A
human would demand to know that kind of thing, to seek
out reasons and causes, but the Azume seemed simply
willing to accept what was. Even a half breed like her
found it near incomprehensible.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Yui said, deciding to pursue it later.
She looked across at Misato, &quot;How hungry are you?&quot;

&quot;Depends,&quot; Misato smiled, &quot;hungry for what?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I can suggest a few things,&quot; Yui grinned as they
went back towards the bedroom.

Yui knew she would keep looking for answers, trying to
solve the riddle of the Azume and their presence on
Earth, but for now, it could wait. There was time to
find those answers... eventually.
