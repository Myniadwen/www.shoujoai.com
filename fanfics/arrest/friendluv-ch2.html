<h1>Friends and Lovers (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../arrest/index.html">You're Under Arrest</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../arrest/friendluv-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>After the morning rollcall, the chief called a small group of officers 
into his office. Natsumi, Miyuki, Aoi, and Yoriko all stood at 
attention, waiting to hear their orders. A small smile tugged at 
Natsumi&#39;s lips as she thought about rollcall.

Nakajima had been beset with questions about how he had managed to get 
his nose broken, and he&#39;d only been able to stammer out a few lame 
sounding excuses. He finally settled on &quot;I wiped out my bike going 
around a curve,&quot; but nobody really believed it.

They all settled their gazes on the most likely suspect, instead. 
Natsumi noticed all the speculative looks she got from Miyuki and some 
of the other officers, but even if she did get into trouble, she 
thought it had been worth it!

The chief loudly clearing his throat brought her back to the present, 
and she focused her attention back on him. The dark hared, mustached 
man was quite capable, having risen through the ranks rather than 
being appointed. She sometimes wondered what the traffic patrol would 
be like without him around.

&quot;At ease,&quot; he said, and the officers all sat down. &quot;There&#39;s been a 
rash of gay-bashings in our district,&quot; the Chief said with a frown, 
the sort of look he usually gave any kind of criminal activity &quot;and so 
far the undercover officers have had no luck finding the 
perpetrators.&quot;

&quot;So what have the officers been out there doing?&quot; Aoi asked him 
curiously, sitting in a most ladylike way in front of his desk. It 
looked even odder compared to the very casual way the other three 
officers were sitting.

He frowned, checking over his pages of notes, &quot;Walking through the 
area of the attacks, primarily.&quot; He looked up, &quot;Which I think is the 
primary problem. There wasn&#39;t anything to convince the bashers that 
they were gay.&quot;

&quot;You want to send a few couples out instead, looking suitably 
romantic,&quot; Yoriko said with a thoughtful nod, adding &quot;It could work.&quot;

&quot;But why pick us?&quot; Natsumi asked, sounding just a bit uncomfortable. 
She didn&#39;t like to think that her interest in girls might be so 
obvious.

&quot;I&#39;d like to use officers who are already very comfortable with 
working closely together,&quot; he said with a mysterious little smile. He 
continued, &quot;People who know each other well enough to pretend that 
they are involved.&quot;

&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Miyuki said, giving Natsumi a thoughtful glance.

Aoi stood up straight, a dangerous twinkle in her eye as she said, 
&quot;I&#39;d like to volunteer, sir!&quot; Yoriko followed her to a standing 
position immediately.

Miyuki and Natsumi exchanged a look filled with silent communication 
before standing up together, &quot;I&#39;d like to volunteer!&quot;

He smiled, handing out papers to each of them. &quot;Pair up, and try to 
dress appropriately. We&#39;ll start tonight,&quot; he said.

They walked out of the office silently, and then gathered to confer. 
&quot;What did he mean, dress appropriately?&quot; Miyuki asked the others 
curiously. She wondered what would be appropriate to wear going out to 
hunt for gay- bashers.

Natsumi hesitated, and Aoi spoke up, smiling with a slightly impish 
look as she said to them, &quot;Natsumi, you get to dress a bit more 
boyish.&quot; She then looked Miyuki up and down thoughtfully, before 
saying, &quot;You have that black party dress still, right? The tight one 
that you complained was a bit too small? Wear that.&quot;

Before Miyuki could protest, Yoriko gave Natsumi a thoughtful glance. 
&quot;How did Nakajima get his nose broken?&quot; she asked her curiously.

Natsumi suddenly found herself under the three young women&#39;s rather 
focused gazes. Rather lamely, she quietly offered up, &quot;He fell down?&quot;

Aoi snorted out her amusement at that, and Yoriko rolled her eyes and 
sighed. &quot;You have got to learn to lie a bit better than that,&quot; a 
smiling Aoi scolded her gently. With a laugh, she and Yoriko walked 
off together.

Letting them move away to a same distance, Miyuki softly asked 
Natsumi, &quot;Did you have something to do with Nakajima&#39;s broken nose?&quot; 
Natsumi didn&#39;t answer her immediately, so Miyuki looked up to meet her 
partner&#39;s eyes.

She met Miyuki&#39;s dark eyes, trying to think of a good enough story 
before finally giving up. &#39;I never could lie to her believably,&#39; 
Natsumi thought to herself a bit wearily. &quot;Yes, I punched him out,&quot; 
she confessed to Miyuki quietly.

&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t have done that,&quot; Miyuki softly scolded her and 
then she smiled at her fondly, &quot;but thank you, anyway.&quot; She leaned 
forward and kissed Natsumi gently on the cheek, before walking back 
towards the squadroom.



Miyuki slowed down, seeing him standing there waiting by his bike. She 
needed to go back home to go get the dress, so she had to go right by 
him. &#39;You can do this,&#39; she thought grimly, and kept on walking.

&quot;Miyuki,&quot; Nakajima said softly, and then he trailed off uncomfortably.

The much smaller woman looked up to meet his eyes. &quot;Nakajima,&quot; she 
said quite coldly, &quot;is there something I can do for you?&quot;

He winced at her tone. &quot;I just wanted to say how sorry I am,&quot; Nakajima 
said to her softly, looking away from her piercing gaze.

&quot;You have a lot to be sorry for, Ken,&quot; she answered, deliberately 
using his first name. Miyuki sighed softly, asking him, &quot;Why did you 
do that to me?&quot;

He looked at her a moment, then decided to tell the truth. &quot;I met her 
just a few months ago. I really did wipe my bike out, and she stopped 
to help me out,&quot; he said quietly. He smiled a bit, &quot;I was so 
embarrassed by the accident I didn&#39;t tell you about it, or meeting her 
either. I saw her a week later at a bike show, and we started meeting 
regularly.&quot;

He put his hand behind his head, blushing a bit as he continued 
&quot;Eventually I started to have deeper feelings for her, and her for me. 
But I didn&#39;t know how to tell you about it all, after I held it back 
from you so long.&quot;

&quot;So instead you got engaged, and only told me after I asked you out?&quot; 
she said bitingly. Nakajima winced again as she continued, &quot;You took 
the easy way out, Ken.&quot; Her expression seemed to soften just a bit as 
she said to him, &quot;Don&#39;t do it again.&quot;

With that, she pushed by him into the parking garage to get her car 
and go home.



Natsumi knotted her tie, settling it down the front of the white shirt 
she wore. She adjusted her leather racing jacket, and then checked to 
see if the ironed crease of her pants was still there. She shook 
herself, trying to get relaxed.

&#39;It feels almost like I&#39;m getting ready to go out on a date,&#39; Natsumi 
thought to herself with a rueful little smile. She stepped out of the 
locker room only to be met by Aoi, who looked her over top to bottom 
thoughtfully.

Aoi reached out to gently loosen the tie a bit before noting, &quot;It 
looks a lot better this way.&quot; She was dressed in a fashionable 
business suit, stylish and refined looking. She almost looked like a 
CEO who had just gotten off work.

In the ladies&#39; room that was just off from the locker room, a careful 
Yoriko was helping Miyuki with her makeup for the evening. &quot;I just 
can&#39;t wait till they all see you in that dress,&quot; she said with a 
little laugh.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe Aoi talked me into wearing it,&quot; Miyuki mumbled back, 
a faint blush coloring her cheeks. She took the opportunity to ask 
something that had been bothering her lately, &quot;Are you and Aoi seeing 
each other?&quot;

Yoriko blushed a bit herself, &quot;Is it that obvious? Yeah, we&#39;ve been 
going out together for a while.&quot; She laughed a bit, &quot;That&#39;s why we 
were so surprised by this assignment.&quot; She looked at Miyuki slyly, &quot;So 
what&#39;s happening with you and Natsumi?&quot;

&quot;Me and Natsumi?&quot; Miyuki echoed her quietly.

Yoriko looked a bit abashed, &quot;Well, Aoi thought that she was 
interested in you, but I noticed she likes to see everyone paired up. 
I guess not?&quot;

Miyuki had a rather odd look on her face, as if she had never really 
considered that idea before, and wasn&#39;t too sure how she liked it. 
&quot;No,&quot; she answered her quietly. &quot;At least,&quot; she added softly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
think so.&quot; Suddenly, Miyuki saw a lot of little things Natsumi had 
done since she first knew her in a whole new light.

There was a little twinkle in her eyes as Yoriko advised her, &quot;Don&#39;t 
let thinking about it bother you too much.&quot; She looked in the mirror, 
unbuttoning a few buttons before smiling in satisfaction, &quot;Come out a 
few minutes after me, okay?&quot;

When Yoriko stepped out, Natsumi had to fight the urge to laugh. Like 
Aoi, she also looked like she had stepped out of a business, but her 
suit jacket was undone, her skirt short, and her white blouse 
unbuttoned enough to show the rise of breasts.

&quot;Are you actually trying to get arrested?&quot; Natsumi said, shaking her 
head at the sexy pair. Still, they looked like they were a couple, and 
that was the point of this little charade. She was just a bit 
surprised at how well they seemed to fit together, honestly. &#39;Almost 
like they&#39;re a couple in real life,&#39; she found herself thinking.

Yoriko laughed softly. &quot;You think we&#39;re hot, you should see Miyuki,&quot; 
she grinned, and pretended to wipe sweat from her brow.

Just then, the young lady in question walked, or maybe slinked, into 
the room, and for just a moment Natsumi simply forgot how to breathe. 
Miyuki&#39;s hair was pinned up so that a few stray curls came down to 
frame her perfectly made up face. But what was really stunning was the 
sexy little black dress that tightly hugged her from about mid thigh 
all the way up to her neck, leaving a delicious bit of cleavage 
clearly visible. She looked so totally different from the daytime 
police officer that she was, it was almost stunning.

&quot;How do I look?&quot; Miyuki asked, turning in a little circle so that they 
could see her from both the front and back. Natsumi couldn&#39;t even 
speak, all she could manage was a loud wolf whistle, bringing out a 
delighted smile from Miyuki.

&quot;Thank you, kind sir,&quot; with a broad smile Miyuki gave her a mock 
curtsy, and then she stepped up to gently take Natsumi&#39;s arm.

Aoi nodded, &quot;You do look good together.&quot; She smiled, offering her own 
arm quite gentlemanly to Yoriko, and they all walked out together.

They parked their unmarked police cars not too far from the district 
where the gay-bashings had happened, and then split up to cover more 
ground. It was a cold night, and Miyuki found herself shivering in her 
short dress.

A arm was placed over her shoulder, and she blushed slightly as 
Natsumi pulled her close. &quot;Do you want to wear my jacket?&quot; Natsumi 
offered to her softly.

Miyuki smiled over at her, struck yet again by how kind she could be 
to her. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said to Natsumi softly, &quot;this is just fine.&quot; 
Miyuki snuggled into Natsumi&#39;s arm, and noticed how very handsome she 
looked, dressed up like she was and with a faint blush to her cheeks, 
showing that she had a softer side, too.

Natsumi felt Miyuki looking over at her, and fought to keep from 
blushing any harder. It didn&#39;t help how pleasant it felt to hold 
Miyuki close the way she was. The blood was ringing so badly in her 
ears that she didn&#39;t even hear something Miyuki had just said. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, what was that?&quot; Natsumi asked her softly.

&quot;Yoriko and I had an interesting little conversation while she was 
helping me to get ready,&quot; Miyuki said with a little smile. She looked 
over at Natsumi, and quietly said, &quot;It seems that Aoi thinks you might 
be interested in me.&quot;

Natsumi&#39;s face went bone pale. &quot;I...&quot; she started to say, when Miyuki 
reached over to shush her. She stepped over to her, pressing her body 
up against Natsumi&#39;s own, so close that her breath was gently tickling 
her ear.

Whispering softly into Natsumi&#39;s ear, Miyuki said, &quot;I think I hear 
someone coming up the alley. Look over my shoulder?&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Natsumi whispered back to her even as she reached into her 
coat to check on her holstered gun. She saw two young men emerge from 
the shadows and advance on them, one carrying a broken length of pipe.

The pipe wielding man swung at Natsumi, who pushed Miyuki to safety as 
she agilely side stepped the blow. &quot;We&#39;re police!&quot; she cried out, then 
she flashed her badge as she added, &quot;You are both under arrest for 
attempted assault.&quot;

&quot;Shit,&quot; the other goon muttered, and tried to turn around and run 
away. But before he could get very far Miyuki casually stuck her foot 
out to trip him, sending him sprawling to the ground and in the 
process he managed to knock himself out.

&quot;Well, that was easy,&quot; Miyuki commented dryly as she knelt on his back 
to pull his arms back and put the cuffs on him.

The guy with the pipe decided to go after Natsumi, swinging at her 
head. She hissed in pain as it grazed her forehead, drawing blood, and 
she quickly pulled the pipe right out of his hand. A single blow put 
him down to the ground. &quot;Why don&#39;t they ever just surrender?&quot; Natsumi 
asked just before slapping the cuffs on her prisoner.

&quot;You&#39;ve been hurt!&quot; Miyuki exclaimed, pulling her goon roughly up to 
his feet. The cut was just above Natsumi&#39;s eyebrow, causing a little 
trickle of blood to flow down into her eyes. Miyuki was suddenly 
struck with the urge to hurt the pipe wielding thug very, very badly.

Back at the station&#39;s locker room Miyuki gently cleaned the head wound 
before putting a bandage on it. They had turned over the thugs to the 
cops and radioed Aoi and Yoriko to meet them back at the station.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Natsumi said when Miyuki finished up.

Miyuki reached out to gently tug at Natsumi&#39;s tie, a little smile on 
her face. &quot;You really look handsome like this, even with the bandage,&quot; 
she said softly.

Natsumi blushed fiercely, looking down at the floor.

&quot;You know,&quot; Miyuki said softly, &quot;we never did finish our little talk 
earlier.&quot; She pushed gently under Natsumi&#39;s chin, making their eyes 
meet as she asked her, &quot;Was Aoi right? Do you have feelings for me?&quot;

&#39;Just can&#39;t seem to lie to her,&#39; Natsumi thought, even as she said 
softly, &quot;Yes, she was right. I do care for you, Miyuki.&quot;

There was an odd look on Miyuki&#39;s face, as if she really wasn&#39;t 
expecting her to actually say yes. &quot;I never knew,&quot; she said softly. 
She looked at Natsumi searchingly before asking her, &quot;How long have 
you felt this way?&quot;

With a sad little smile, Natsumi said, &quot;Not too long after I first met 
you, actually.&quot; She looked thoughtful, &quot;Back when I first met you, you 
were such a pain, but even then I couldn&#39;t look at you without feeling 
my heart skip a beat.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve felt this way about me for so long?&quot; Miyuki said in surprise. 
She shook her head as she asked, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;

Natsumi gave a soft sigh, trying to think about what the right thing 
to say to her was. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to scare you away from me with this, 
Miyuki,&quot; she said softly. She reached out to take Miyuki&#39;s hand, 
gently adding &quot;We&#39;re best friends, and if that&#39;s all we&#39;ll ever be 
then I&#39;ll be content with that.&quot; She smiled, &quot;I just want you to be 
happy, Miyuki.&quot;

Miyuki smiled, a few tears glimmering in her eyes. Without any warning 
she leaned forward, gently pressing her lips to Natsumi&#39;s own. Natsumi 
brought her hands up to take her shoulders, then she stopped herself, 
lowering her hands again. Miyuki drew back to look up at her 
questioningly, and Natsumi smiled at her ruefully.

&quot;I&#39;m sure this is a shock to you,&quot; Natsumi said to her gently, &quot;and I 
don&#39;t want you to do something that you might regret.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I could ever regret having someone like you love me,&quot; 
Miyuki answered her very calmly. Natsumi blushed at that, and Miyuki 
softly added &quot;I think I love you, too.&quot;

Natsumi looked searchingly into her eyes, and in Miyuki&#39;s sweet gaze 
she only found love there. Natsumi chose to start the kiss this time, 
and put her heart into it. She heard Miyuki sigh softly, her lips 
parting, when suddenly...

...Aoi and Yoriko walked in to the locker room. Aoi whistled loudly, 
then grinned, while poor Yoriko blushed, putting her hands over her 
eyes. She made sure she could still peek out between her fingers, 
though.

The two jerked apart, blushing fiercely. Aoi laughed, &quot;Don&#39;t let us 
stop you.&quot;

As Aoi and Yoriko left, they could hear Yoriko saying to Aoi, &quot;I guess 
you were right about the two of them.&quot; A little pause, and, &quot;So what 
did we bet again?&quot;

&quot;Slave girl for as night,&quot; Aoi answered her with a throaty laugh.

&quot;Next time, we lock the door,&quot; Natsumi laughed softly, blushing 
fiercely.

A also blushing Miyuki nodded to her firmly. She got up and walked 
over to the locker room door, closing and locking it with a loud 
click. Miyuki leaned against the door and in a sultry tone of voice 
asked her, &quot;Now, where were we?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s notes: The idea of Miyuki and Natsumi having a romantic 
relationship is mostly the product of my own imagination, coupled with 
some fairly suggestive pieces of official YUA art. And some 
interesting bits of dialog, too.

&quot;I don&#39;t like pretty boys. They remind me of me...&quot; Natsumi, from #1 
of the comic books.

In what I&#39;ve read of the English translated manga series, Natsumi and 
Miyuki live apart, so I&#39;ve given them separate residences in this fic. 
Maybe this is why they moved in together in the TV series? ^_^

Yes, I know Ken is somewhat OOC, though I hope his actions are at 
least understandable. I felt that someone had to be the bad guy in the 
break-up, and the only other way I could do this would be to actually 
kill him off or something. So sue me...

Aoi and Yoriko is another product of my overactive imagination, and 
more pieces of suggestive art. But boy, they sure are cute together. I 
wonder if they qualify as Shoujo-ai? </pre>
