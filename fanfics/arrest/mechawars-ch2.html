<h1>Mecha Wars (part 2 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../arrest/index.html">You're Under Arrest</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../arrest/mechawars-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The two techs carefully rolled out the massive container from the 
special cold storage unit, looking it over curiously. Finally, one 
quietly spoke up to the other, &quot;Hey Joe, what the heck is this old 
thing, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Some kinda early experiment in cyborg based technology,&quot; Joe answered 
him in his usual deadpan delivery. &quot;Back from the turn of the century, 
I think.&quot; His eyes widened a bit, &quot;Hey, watch out on your side, Mac!&quot;

It tottered, wobbled a bit, and then finally just fell right over, the 
glass front shattering loudly. A figure spilled out onto the cement 
floor, laying there deathly still. It was a teenaged girl, red-headed, 
and dressed only in a bathing suit. As her body rapidly warmed, a mist 
rose from her body, obscuring her from their view.

Mac waved his hands around, trying to clear the blinding mist, when he 
realized something: the girl was gone. He looked around wildly, but 
didn&#39;t see a trace of her. &quot;Joe, she&#39;s gone!&quot; he yelled rather 
desperately.

&quot;Boss ain&#39;t gonna like this,&quot; a deadpan Joe said to his friend, 
shaking his head mournfully. He walked to a nearby phone, passing by a 
sign reading &quot;Genom long term storage facility&quot; and began dialing a 
number. He said calmly, &quot;Sir, we&#39;ve got a problem. Project number 
1261-NukuNuku seems to have escaped.&quot;

The redhead bolted down the crowded side-street, running with 
incredible speed. Suddenly, in a cloud of dust she screeched to a stop 
beside a little fish market. &quot;Hmm, fishies,&quot; she sighed to herself 
softly, licking her lips. She straightened up, shaking her head as she 
reminded herself, &quot;No! I&#39;ve gotta find Ryunosuke!&quot;

She took off, trying to find any familiar looking landmarks. Coming 
around a corner, she saw a short young woman dressed in a police 
uniform walking along the street. A little cartoon appears above the 
red-hared girl&#39;s head as she thinks: A chibi-police officer equals 
help, and help means finding Ryunosuke!

She walked up to her, &quot;Excuse me, but can you help me?&quot;

Nene looked up at the tall girl in surprise. &#39;What in the world is she 
doing running around town in a swimsuit?&#39; she wondered. &quot;What&#39;s the 
problem?&quot; she asked her.

&quot;I&#39;m lost,&quot; the girl said mournfully, &quot;and I need to find Ryunosuke.&quot;

Nene pulled out a notepad and wrote that down, &quot;And you are?&quot;

&quot;Nuku Nuku,&quot; she answered her cheerfully.

Before the conversation could go any farther, two men dressed in 
poorly fitting business suits came up behind Nuku Nuku, one putting 
his hand on her shoulder. &quot;You&#39;re coming with us,&quot; he said to her in 
gravely tones.

&quot;No,&quot; Nuku Nuku said, shrugging off the hand to the suit&#39;s obvious 
surprise. They exchange a look, then both suits try to grab her arms.

&quot;Hold on a second,&quot; Nene loudly protested this, &quot;I&#39;m with the AD 
Police, and this woman was asking for my help.&quot;

Both men look alarmed at hearing that. Their bodies swelled up, the 
fabric of the suits tearing open, then suddenly the skin itself ripped 
open, revealing dark metal underneath.

&quot;Boomers,&quot; Nene squeaked out softly, suddenly wishing that she had her 
hardsuit with her right about now.

Nuku Nuku shook her head, and what looked like a pair of metallic 
rabbit&#39;s ears popped out on either side of her head. She easily tore 
one of her arms free, taking the startled boomer&#39;s arm with it. She 
shook the detached hand off, then swung her fist at the other boomer&#39;s 
head! It bounced nicely off a alley wall, sliding to the floor.

Two other boomers came from around the corner, and Nuku Nuku made a 
quick decision. She picked Nene right up in her arms and then bolted 
away from them at top speed.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Nene hollered, &quot;put me down right now!&quot;

Nuku Nuku pretty much ignored her, barreling along as fast as 
possible. The boomers were following right behind them, firing at them 
wildly. &quot;Then again,&quot; Nene quietly said, looking over Nuku Nuku&#39;s 
shoulder at the racing boomers, &quot;maybe not.&quot; She pulled her phone from 
her pocket and hit the speed dial.

Sylia Stingray reached across the desk to pick up the phone, &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;There are,&quot; Nene said, checking over Nuku Nuku&#39;s shoulder to count 
again, &quot;four combat boomers chasing a red headed girl downtown!&quot;

&quot;And how do you know about that?&quot; Sylia asked her, already paging the 
other members of the Knight Sabers as she did so.

&quot;Because she&#39;s carrying me along with her!&quot; Nene cried out.

&quot;We&#39;ll be there as soon as possible,&quot; Sylia reassured her.

The young man read the monitor in disbelief, pushing his scraggly 
brown hair up and out of his eyes to do so. He quickly brought the 
inter- office communication system up, and soon a auburn haired 
executive was on his view screen.

&quot;Mom,&quot; he quickly said to her, &quot;that data tap I put on Genom&#39;s 
computer systems came up with something!&quot;

Akiko frowned slightly, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; and 
she smiled, adding, &quot;at least not officially, Ryunosuke.&quot;

Ryunosuke rolled his eyes at that. &quot;Nuku Nuku&#39;s awake,&quot; he reported. 
&quot;And her survival instincts are as good as ever. She bolted the first 
chance she could,&quot; he said with a smile.

&quot;Stay here,&quot; Akiko barked, as he was about to get out of his chair. 
&quot;I&#39;ll take care of it,&quot; she added softly, a determined look in her 
eye.

&quot;Like you did last time?&quot; he asked her skeptically.

Her expression softened. &quot;I promised your father, Kyasuku, that I&#39;d 
save her, son. You know I keep my word,&quot; she said softly.

He nodded his acknowledgment, and she disconnected. She reached for 
her phone, then stopped. A smile appears, and she quickly dialed, 
&quot;Arisa, Kyouko? It&#39;s Akiko. I need your help with a little unfinished 
business I need to take care of.&quot;

Sylia, Priss and Linna suited up, as the van hurried down side streets 
to try and catch up with the chase. From up front Mackie reported, 
&quot;There&#39;s at least six boomers after them, now!&quot;

&quot;So why is Genom after her, anyway?&quot; Linna asked, her helmet resting 
in her lap.

&quot;There were always rumors in the robotics community about a miracle 
robot. Somehow, it combined organic and computer brains to create 
something greater that the sum of it&#39;s parts,&quot; Sylia explained to them 
coolly. &quot;I think the red head&#39;s that robot.&quot;

Mackie shouted to the back, &quot;We&#39;re about a block or so ahead of them, 
but they&#39;re coming up to us fast!&quot;

Their helmets were donned and the three of them headed out on to the 
street. Nuku Nuku was still maintaining a fairly good lead, but the 
twelve boomers that were now chasing after her were starting to catch 
up.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Sylia said crisply, and led the others right by Nuku Nuku 
and into the very surprised boomers. &#39;I don&#39;t very much like these 
odds,&#39; she thought grimly, &#39;but it&#39;s not like we have much of a 
choice.&#39;

Nuku Nuku skidded to a stop, surprised. &quot;They&#39;re my friends,&quot; Nene said 
with a grin, &quot;they&#39;re the Knight Sabers!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re outnumbered,&quot; Nuku Nuku said softly, watching them fight the 
mob of boomers on her behalf. Four against one wasn&#39;t easy, but the 
Knight Sabers were trying their best. She put Nene down, &quot;I&#39;m going to 
help them!&quot;

Before Nene could say anything to argue that decision, Nuku Nuku was 
gone, charging like a shot into the wild melee. Nene looked around her 
wildly for the Silky Doll truck, but couldn&#39;t see any sign of it.

Linna struggled, her arm pinned behind her back, then suddenly she was 
free! Nuku Nuku flipped one boomer back towards Priss, who blew it 
away mid air. A broad smile stretched across Nuku Nuku&#39;s face, as if 
she was having a great time.

&quot;Is she crazy?&quot; Priss asked Sylia over the radios.

&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Sylia answered, &quot;but she&#39;s pretty much invulnerable. 
This likely is fun to her!&quot;

A screech of tires, and a armored jeep came around the corner, nearly 
clipping Nene. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Kyouko yelled out to her from the driver&#39;s 
side window.

The top popped back, and another woman stood up in the back seat, 
carrying a big weapon. &quot;Just like old times,&quot; Arisa laughed, and fired 
off a guided missile into the battle field!

A boomer exploded in a massive fireball, then another as the Knight 
Sabers and Nuku Nuku pulled back from the fight. Akiko picked up 
another rocket launched, and between them they managed to deal with 
the majority of the boomers.

&quot;Are any of the head&#39;s still intact?&quot; Akiko asked those around her 
quickly.

Priss looked around, then picked one up. &quot;What do you want with it?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;To send Quincy a little message,&quot; Akiko said with a dangerous little 
smile. Priss handed her the head, and Akiko looked into the eyes as 
she said, &quot;I&#39;m sure this is being monitored. Nuku Nuku is not Genom&#39;s 
property, and was acquired by the company illegally. If you attempt to 
go after her again, I will fight you in court with all of my 
resources.&quot;

An evil smile crossed her face as Akiko softly added , &quot;I know how 
financially overextended you are, Quincy, and I really doubt you can 
afford to play lawyers with me right now.&quot;

While this conversation was going on, Sylia signaled to Linna and 
Priss. She figured the situation was well in hand, so she silently led 
the two Sabers away. Nene gave them a wave, but decided to stay and 
keep an eye on Nuku Nuku.

Nuku Nuku looked thoughtfully over at Arisa and Kyouko, a odd look on 
her face. &quot;I know you,&quot; she exclaimed, pointing, &quot;we used to play 
together!&quot;

&quot;Play,&quot; Arisa echoed, rolling her eyes. An aside to Kyouko, &quot;Can you 
believe that&#39;s what she calls out attempts to blow her up?&quot;

&quot;There, there, love,&quot; Kyouko smiled, gently taking her hand, &quot;you have 
to admit we all had fun back then.&quot;

Akiko tossed the boomer&#39;s head aside casually as she walked towards 
Nuku Nuku and the others. &quot;Do you remember me?&quot; Akiko asked her 
softly.

Nuku Nuku nodded, &quot;You&#39;re Ryunosuke&#39;s mama.&quot;

Akiko chuckled softly at being called that, &quot;Yes, he sent me to get 
you.&quot;

&quot;But where&#39;s Papa?&quot; Nuku Nuku asked her plaintively, &quot;Where&#39;s 
Kyasuku?&quot;

Akiko smiled sadly, putting her hand gently on Nuku Nuku, &quot;He died 
several years ago. But I promised him I&#39;d take care of you, I&#39;m just 
sorry it&#39;s taken so long.&quot;

Nuku Nuku, Akiko, Arisa and Kyouko walked towards the jeep together, 
and Nuku Nuku quietly asked, &quot;Can you take me to Ryunosuke?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Akiko said, smiling fondly at Nuku Nuku&#39;s loyalty, &quot;we&#39;ll go 
see him and Eimi next. Then you can all play together.&quot;

Nene shook her head, watching them go. It was almost sickeningly cute 
to see, but still touching, somehow. The jeep roared off, Nene still 
smiling slightly. Then something occurred to her.

&quot;How am I gonna get home?&quot; Nene wailed, looking around her wildly. </pre>
