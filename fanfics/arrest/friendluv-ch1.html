<h1>Friends and Lovers (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../arrest/index.html">You're Under Arrest</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was the end of the day, and the heroic officers of the traffic 
patrol were coming and going as one shift clocked out and another 
started up their working day. Friends waved their hellos and said 
their good-byes.

And in one corner of the bustling station, a young lady stood there 
nervously, as if she was waiting for just the right moment. The long 
hared girl would take a step forward, falter, then step back. She 
watched, silently, waiting for some undetermined signal.

Natsumi noticed this, and so she silently stepped up behind her to 
gave her a gentle push forward. She leaned forward to whisper in to 
her friend&#39;s ear intensely, &quot;You&#39;ve got to go for it, Miyuki! You&#39;ve 
told me how you feel about him, so now go tell him!&quot;

Miyuki looked over her shoulder at Natsumi a bit hesitantly, then she 
seemed to draw strength from her friend confident gaze. With a much 
more firm step, she walked over to talk to Ken Nakajima. Natsumi 
watched her go, a sad little smile on her face, then as quietly as she 
could she slid her way through the people to leave the police station.

Almost as soon as she left the station, the cold night air brushed at 
Natsumi&#39;s skin, the cold, brisk wind bringing a few tears to her eyes 
as it blew her short hair back from her face. Or at least, she could 
try to blame the wind for the tears.

&#39;She really loves him,&#39; Natsumi thought to herself sadly, &#39;she tells 
me about it all the time. She&#39;s just too shy to admit it.&#39; She walked 
along, lost in her thoughts, enjoying the silence and a few moments of 
blessed peace.

A soft voice called out her name, and Natsumi was violently jerked 
from her peace and quiet. She turned back to see Aoi gracefully 
running to try and catch up with her.

Aoi Futaba was one of the unit&#39;s more interesting police officers. 
Having started out her life as a male officer, he was on an extended 
undercover operation where he discovered that he preferred living his 
life as a woman. So he chose to become one full time.

&quot;You just walk too fast,&quot; Aoi quite pleasantly complained to Natsumi. 
She was a little bit taller than Natsumi, but not by very much, and 
walked with a smooth feminine grace, her long dark hair flowing behind 
her like a cape. Even the people who actually knew about her secret 
often found themselves completely forgetting that she was actually a 
male.

&quot;Sorry, Aoi. I guess I had some things on my mind,&quot; Natsumi answered 
her a bit sheepishly. Inwardly, she cursed, wishing that she had just 
rode her motorcycle straight home, rather than deciding to go take a 
little walk first.

They talked together quietly for a few minutes, then out of nowhere 
Aoi softly said, &quot;You really should tell her how you feel about her.&quot;

Natsumi looked quite startled, &quot;What?&quot;

Aoi gave her a little smile as she patiently added, &quot;You do care about 
Miyuki, right?&quot;

Natsumi blushed brightly before stammering out, &quot;No, of course not!&quot; 
She looked away from Aoi&#39;s stern glance, mumbling softly, &quot;She&#39;s got 
it bad for Nakajima.&quot;

&quot;Who mostly ignores her,&quot; Aoi calmly pointed out to her. &quot;When he 
isn&#39;t treating her more like his little sister, anyway,&quot; she finished.

&quot;Sorry, Aoi, but I&#39;m not getting my hopes up,&quot; Natsumi said softly in 
reply. She stopped, and Aoi was startled to see the pain that was 
visible in her eyes. &quot;I want her happy,&quot; she explained, &quot;and I don&#39;t 
think I could do that for her.&quot;

Before Aoi could say anything else to her, Natsumi was gone, 
practically running back up the sidewalk to the police station to 
retrieve her bike and get going. A woman who had been following their 
walk stepped out of the shadows, pushing her glasses up.

Yoriko smiled up at her, taking Aoi&#39;s arm as she asked her, &quot;No luck, 
huh?&quot; They started to walk back to the station, standing close 
together to conserve warmth.

Aoi smiled down at the little police officer, feeling the warmth of 
her body close to hers. &quot;No, it looks like she&#39;s still firmly in a 
state of denial,&quot; she reported.

Yoriko looked at Aoi with a bit of concern. &quot;You know, your gaydar 
could be wrong about them. They might just be good friends,&quot; she said.

Aoi just raised her eyebrow at Yoriko, answering her indignantly &quot;Hey, 
when has my gaydar ever been wrong about someone before?&quot; She chuckled 
softly, &quot;I was right about Sylia and Priss, right?&quot; Yoriko nodded, and 
Aoi continued on, &quot;And about Rei and Asuka, and about Hikaru, Umi, and 
Fuu, not to mention Sakura and Tomoyo, and...&quot;

&quot;OK, OK,&quot; Yoriko laughed, waving her hands in surrender. &quot;I guess 
we&#39;ll just have to keep trying,&quot; Yoriko said as optimistically as she 
could. She looked up at Aoi and asked her with a smile, &quot;Are we still 
on for tonight, love?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t miss it,&quot; Aoi answered, silently glad that it was her turn 
to cook them dinner tonight. She was a lot better at it than Yoriko 
was, strangely.



Miyuki was strangely quiet during the next morning&#39;s roll call, 
looking ahead stiffly and not meeting the other officers&#39; eyes. She 
didn&#39;t look very good at all, almost as if she might be coming down 
with something. &#39;If she got some kind of bug from Nakajima,&#39; Natsumi 
thought to herself fiercely, &#39;she&#39;d better not give it to me.&#39;

Natsumi walked with her over to their little patrol car, and once they 
climbed in she asked Miyuki, &quot;Hey, is something wrong?&quot;

Miyuki gave a little sniff, as if she was fighting back a rush of 
tears. &quot;We broke up,&quot; she said to Natsumi in a soft whisper.

Natsumi&#39;s eyes widened in shock, hearing the deep pain that was 
clearly evident in Miyuki&#39;s voice. &quot;What?&quot; she asked her 
disbelievingly. She shook her head even as she asked her, &quot;How could 
he do that to you?&quot;

A bitter smile appeared on Miyuki&#39;s lips as she said, &quot;Easily. It 
seems he&#39;s in love with someone.&quot; She took a deep breath, adding 
softly &quot;They&#39;re getting engaged.&quot;

&quot;And he didn&#39;t tell you about it before now?!&quot; Natsumi demanded 
angrily.

Natsumi wasn&#39;t sure what about this was upsetting her more, Miyuki&#39;s 
odd quietness or Nakajima&#39;s stringing her friend along the way he had. 
&#39;No, Nakajima pisses me off more,&#39; she decided, and she silently 
resolved to do something about it as soon as possible.

&quot;We didn&#39;t promise each other anything,&quot; Miyuki said with a weary 
sounding sigh. The long hared girl looked over at her partner, 
managing to give her a weak smile as she said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk 
about it anymore.&quot;

Natsumi looked over at her friend&#39;s pained expression and swallowed 
what she wanted to say. She just nodded to her silently in reply, 
instead. &quot;All right,&quot; Natsumi said softly, feeling a sudden stab of 
guilt about what happened. &#39;If I hadn&#39;t pushed her,&#39; she thought with 
a sigh, &#39;this might never have happened.&#39;

Their day started to speed up soon afterward, the normal casework of 
the traffic patrol occupying their minds and keeping them both busy. 
Finally, they returned to the station to complete their paperwork and 
close out the day. After getting changed, Natsumi left Miyuki in the 
locker room, explaining that she&#39;d be back in a moment.

The cycle pulled in and Nakajima smiled over at her in surprise. 
Climbing off his bike he called out to her, &quot;Hey, Natsumi, how&#39;s it 
going?&quot;

Without a word being said she stepped up and then punched him right in 
the face. He hit the ground, his butt taking the impact, a surprised 
expression on his face. A shake of the head, a rueful smile, and he 
said, &quot;I guess you heard, huh?&quot;

&quot;That was for Miyuki,&quot; Natsumi answered him quite coldly before simply 
turning around and walking away. She didn&#39;t think he&#39;d try and cause 
her any trouble, he was too macho to admit he&#39;d been knocked down by a 
girl.

An odd smile tugged at Natsumi&#39;s lips when she saw what was waiting 
for her in the station&#39;s squad room. Miyuki and Yoriko sat 
comfortably, while in the perfect office lady style Aoi Futaba was 
pouring each of them their cups of tea. Natsumi took a seat beside 
Miyuki before asking Aoi, &quot;Could you get me one, too?&quot;

Aoi laughed softly, produced another cup and poured tea for her before 
taking a seat herself. They talked softly, noticeably ignoring the 
topic of Nakajima and Miyuki. Both Aoi and Yoriko looked concerned 
about her, though.

&#39;I wish I could watch over her,&#39; Natsumi thought sadly, then she was 
struck by a brilliant idea. &quot;Could you give me a ride home?&quot; she asked 
Miyuki softly.

Miyuki looked over at her in surprise, then she nodded. &quot;Sure, I&#39;d be 
glad too.&quot; She smiled at Natsumi shyly, &quot;I&#39;ll bring the car around, 
and we&#39;ll load your bike into the back,&quot; she said decisively, walking 
off to go get her car.

Natsumi noticed the questioning gazes from both Aoi and Yoriko, 
crossly explaining, &quot;I just don&#39;t want her to be alone right now.&quot; She 
jogged off to meet Miyuki over by the entrance, leaving her friends 
gazing after her thoughtfully.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Aoi said thoughtfully. &quot;Did you see the way 
they were with each other?&quot; she asked Yoriko.

Yoriko frowned at her, &quot;She&#39;s just worried about a friend.&quot; She looked 
off to where Natsumi had gone before quietly adding, &quot;I think.&quot;

Miyuki smiled over at her from behind the wheel, releasing the back 
hatch so that Natsumi could load up her bike. She climbed in to the 
passenger&#39;s side, saying quietly &quot;Thanks.&quot;

They talked a bit as they drove home, about the day and some of the 
funnier things that had happened to them, but all too soon they 
reached Natsumi&#39;s apartment building. They unloaded the bike together, 
then Natsumi reached out to stop Miyuki a moment.

&quot;Do you want to come up for a bit?&quot; she asked Miyuki softly.

She looked a bit startled by the request, then Miyuki nodded. Natsumi 
locked up her bike and then led Miyuki upstairs to her little 
apartment. Unlocking the front door, she waved Miyuki inside. She 
blushed suddenly, remembering the sorry state she had left the place 
in when she left that morning, &quot;Sorry about the mess.&quot;

Miyuki shook her head, seeing the piles of clothes, sink full of 
unwashed dishes, and bike magazines scattered all around. &quot;It&#39;s not as 
bad as I was expecting,&quot; she said with a smile, her tone of voice 
indicating the sort of mess she thought she&#39;d see.

Natsumi pulled out a small bottle of good sake and two small cups, sat 
them on the table and poured some of it out for each of them. At 
Miyuki&#39;s questioning glance she smiled at her wryly before describing 
it as &quot;Pain reliever.&quot;

Miyuki picked her cup up, and slugged it back in one smooth motion, 
shuddering a little at the taste. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said with a little 
smile.

Natsumi raised her eyebrow, and topped up both the glasses once again, 
before getting up to put her old stereo on. Thankfully, the Clint 
Eastwood CD wasn&#39;t in there, and soft, instrumental music began to 
play.

&quot;Not my normal style,&quot; Natsumi said with a shrug, &quot;but it&#39;ll do.&quot; She 
sat down to drink some of her sake, too, noticing that Miyuki had 
emptied her cup yet again. Refilling it, she said softly, &quot;Now, I&#39;m 
sorry I pushed you at him. Forgive me?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Miyuki smiled, a bit of red in her cheeks from the 
drink. &quot;I didn&#39;t know he was such a jerk,&quot; she said a bit sadly, &quot;so 
how could you?&quot; She drank more of the sake, her hands shaking a 
little, and Natsumi noticed she had begun to cry again.

Natsumi sat down by her on the couch, reaching out to gently pat 
Miyuki on the shoulder. She was surprised when her friend turned in 
towards her, grabbing at her shirt and crying softly against her 
chest. Natsumi gently wrapped her arms around Miyuki, stroking her 
back comfortingly, softly repeating, &quot;There, there.&quot;

She cried herself out, finally, her grip on the front of Natsumi&#39;s 
shirt loosening a little. Miyuki looked up at her, her cheeks red and 
eyes bleary, &quot;Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to just fall apart like that. It&#39;s 
just been that I&#39;ve maintained a brave face with everybody today, 
and...&quot;

Natsumi gently pushed Miyuki&#39;s hair out of her eyes, &quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot; 
She smiled wryly, &quot;If you need somebody to vent to, I&#39;d like it to be 
me, partner.&quot; A little blush colored her cheeks as she said that, a 
bit uncomfortable at the intimacy.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Miyuki smiled back at her gently. They looked into each 
other&#39;s eyes a moment, and Miyuki&#39;s mouth opened, as if she was going 
to say something.

Seeing her pause, Natsumi asked curiously, &quot;What?&quot;

Miyuki looked away, &quot;Nothing.&quot; She tried to stand up, only to sway 
dangerously. &quot;Whoa,&quot; she said softly, &quot;why&#39;s the room spinning?&quot;

Natsumi quickly got to her feet, grabbing her arm and steadying her. 
&quot;I guess you don&#39;t drink much,&quot; she noted, and gently pushed her back 
down to the couch. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re staying here tonight,&quot; she said 
softly.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Miyuki said weakly, her head spinning.

&quot;Sure you are,&quot; Natsumi answered her with a sigh. She got out a 
blanket and a pillow for her, and set the livingroom couch up as a 
temporary bed. &quot;You want to borrow a T-shirt to wear to bed?&quot; she 
asked Miyuki casually.

The other girl sighed softly, giving in. &quot;Yes, please,&quot; Miyuki said 
quietly. Natsumi dropped an oversized T-shirt beside her friend, then 
sat down beside her.

&quot;Are you going to be all right out here?&quot; Natsumi asked quietly. A 
little voice in the back of her head suggested she share the bed with 
Miyuki, but she beat it back furiously. It was not a good idea right 
now, with how she&#39;d been feeling.

&quot;Yes, once I sleep this off,&quot; Miyuki answered her a bit blurrily.

&quot;Go to sleep,&quot; Natsumi said to her gently, and then left her to get 
ready for bed. She was walking from the bathroom to her bedroom when 
she paused by the livingroom and looked in.

Miyuki had nearly stripped down to nothing, standing there unsteadily 
in only her panties and bra. &#39;Beautiful,&#39; Natsumi found herself 
thinking, &#39;she looks so beautiful.&#39; Swaying a bit, Miyuki then 
awkwardly pulled the T- shirt over them, and Natsumi fled. But she 
found that sight lingered in her memory long into the night.



Aoi raised her eyebrow as she and Yoriko finished up their reports and 
got ready to leave the police station. Nakajima lurked near the front 
doorway, looking rather uncomfortable. Oddly, a large bandage was 
stuck on the bridge of his nose, and a bit of toilet paper was wadded 
up underneath it to stop any fresh blood flow.

&#39;Gee,&#39; Aoi thought with a smile, &#39;I wonder who could have done that to 
him?&#39; She and Yoriko walked towards him together, and she noticed he 
looked the worse for wear. The somewhat flushed looking officer 
stepped up to them, and then he hesitantly drew Aoi aside.

&quot;Could I talk to you a moment?&quot; he asked Aoi.

Aoi looked up at the obviously pleading expression on his face, and 
gave a soft sigh. Turning to smile at Yoriko, she said, &quot;Go on ahead, 
I&#39;ll meet you outside in a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be long,&quot; Yoriko said, and with an impish little smile she 
leaned forward to give Aoi a little peck on the cheek before she left.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Nakajima said, sounding more than a bit surprised. &quot;So how long 
has this been going on?&quot; he asked her softly.

&quot;Is that the only thing you wanted to talk to me about?&quot; Aoi asked him 
sternly, raising an single elegant eyebrow.

&quot;No, no,&quot; he said to her quickly. A short pause, then a much more 
subdued sounding Nakajima asked her, &quot;How&#39;s Miyuki doing?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s been really hurt, obviously,&quot; Aoi said, a bit of her anger 
showing through her usual calm. She had already heard some of the 
rumors about him breaking up with her that were already spreading 
through the station grapevine. Another thought occurred to her, 
&quot;Natsumi is really angry, by the way. I&#39;d advise avoiding her.&quot;

He sighed, reaching up to brush at his blunt nose, and then winced at 
the flare of pain. &quot;Too late,&quot; Nakajima said softly.

Aoi tried not to smile, finally realizing how the man had gotten his 
nose broken. &#39;I have got,&#39; she thought with a hidden smile, &#39;to get 
the story of how Natsumi did that!&#39; She looked at her watch, then 
asked Nakajima, &quot;Is there anything else?&quot;

A bit of a blush appeared on Nakajima&#39;s cheeks. &quot;If you see Miyuki,&quot; 
he quietly said, &quot;could you tell her how sorry I am?&quot;

&quot;You really need to do that yourself,&quot; Aoi said to him gently. She 
smiled a bit, &quot;Once both of them calm down, anyway.&quot; Nakajima sadly 
nodded his agreement.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nakajima said with a sigh, and he turned to walk away.



&#39;Why did seeing her like that effect me so much?&#39; a somewhat groggy 
Natsumi found herself wondering as she put some coffee on early the 
next morning. A large bottle of aspirin sat nearby, and a small pot of 
warm cereal was heating up on the stove. &#39;It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t see 
her get changed for patrol almost every day,&#39; she thought with a 
frown.

A soft, drawn out groan came from the livingroom, and Natsumi picked 
up the aspirin and a cup of coffee before walking in. Miyuki sat up on 
the couch, her hair sticking up, holding her head in her hands and 
looking truly miserable.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Miyuki groaned softly.

Natsumi had to fight back a smile at how funny her partner looked just 
then. &#39;Cute, too,&#39; she noted, then blushed. &quot;You drank a bit too much 
last night,&quot; she quietly said, putting the items down on a table by 
the couch.

Miyuki flinched at the sound. She picked up the aspirin, alternating 
swallowing them with big gulps of her hot cup of coffee. She managed 
to smile up at Natsumi, &quot;Could you drive me and my car back home? I 
need to get dressed for work.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to call in sick?&quot; Natsumi asked her. She really didn&#39;t 
think Miyuki looked very good this morning. &quot;I&#39;m sure no one would 
mind.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Miyuki said, shaking her head. She paled from the pain the 
motion triggered and took a few more aspirin before adding &quot;I want to 
try and stay busy.&quot;

They silently sat together at the little kitchen table, eating a quick 
breakfast of cereal and fresh orange juice, and then the clothes issue 
came up. Natsumi honestly thought Miyuki looked even funnier in the 
borrowed clothes from her closet, but it was just until Miyuki could 
get back to her own apartment and get changed.

Natsumi was also more than a bit surprised at how good those old pair 
of shorts really looked on Miyuki&#39;s body, hugging her hips in a far 
more sexy way than they had ever done on her. &#39;Think pure thoughts,&#39; 
she silently commanded herself.

Miyuki stopped still, noticing Natsumi&#39;s gaze resting on her. &quot;Do they 
really look that bad?&quot; she asked her a little wistfully.

Natsumi blushed quite redly. &quot;No, no, you look fine,&quot; she stammered 
out nervously, trying not to meet Miyuki&#39;s eyes. </pre>
