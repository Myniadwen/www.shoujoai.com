<h1>Mecha Wars (part 16 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../arrest/index.html">You're Under Arrest</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../arrest/mechawars-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>        Flying far above the surface of the ocean, the private jet 
soared onward, a sleek, powerful craft with a mission. Adorning one of 
the rudders, a stylized logo was visible in the sunlight: a woman 
singing, and the name just below was Vision.

        &quot;Reika, are you sure you want to do this?&quot; the dark haired man 
asked her quietly. The cabin they sat in was luxurious, filled with 
all the comforts of home, but the brow haired woman seemed very 
uncomfortable, somehow restless.

        Reika Chang raised her hand, looking at the finely crafted 
engagement ring that glittered on her finger. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I 
really want to, Kuo,&quot; she admitted to him quietly, &quot;but I just can&#39;t 
seem to get her out of my mind.&quot;

        In an opulent office of the Genom Tower Madigan looked at the 
report she had been just handed with a expression of pure dismay. She 
shot a glance at the young man and said harshly, &quot;You have got to be 
kidding me.&quot;

        &quot;No, ma&#39;am,&quot; he shook his head glumly. He activated a monitor 
and brought up a live security feed onto the screen.

        Almost as soon as she saw the images Madigan groaned softly, 
&quot;I&#39;ll go tell the chairman.&quot; She picked up the report and data disk 
before she strode down the hallway, her expression deeply troubled. &#39;I 
hope he doesn&#39;t shoot the messenger for this,&#39; she thought to herself 
grimly. She nodded to the secretary outside his office and said 
coldly, &quot;Please tell the Chairman that I have the report on the latest 
special project.&quot;

        &quot;Yes, Ms. Madigan,&quot; the girl put the message through, the 
smiled up at her sunnily. &quot;The chairman says come right in.&quot;

        &quot;Right into the lion&#39;s den,&quot; Madigan muttered softly but 
headed inside, leaving a confused looking secretary behind her.

        &quot;What progress to report, Madigan?&quot; Quincy demanded.

        &quot;It&#39;s gone to hell on us,&quot; she answered him simply.

        &quot;What?!&quot; Quincy blurted out.

        The phone call caught Linna just as she was heading out the 
door to her apartment. She picked it up and asked the caller, &quot;Yes?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s Priss,&quot; the slightly rough voice said. &quot;Have you seen 
the new video by Vision yet?&quot; she demanded without giving any 
explanation.

        &quot;No, I haven&#39;t,&quot; Linna blinked in surprise. She knew that 
Priss had no fondness for Vision or her music, considering everything 
that had happened between the two of them. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; she 
tentatively requested.

        Priss gave a dramatic sounding sigh and said, &quot;Just see it, 
you&#39;ll know why.&quot; With that she disconnected, leaving a mildly 
perturbed Linna listening to a dial tone.

        &quot;Why that,&quot; Linna growled softly, then shook her head. She 
checked her watch, noting that she had some time to spare, and sat 
down at her computer terminal. It was an older model, pretty slow 
compared to one of Sylia&#39;s, but it did the job.

        Linna checked her list of bookmarks, hit one of her favorite 
Vision fan-sites, and quickly found a link to the latest music video. 
It took a second to load it up, but once it did, Linna gaped at the 
screen in honest surprise.

        Vision played herself, of course, and the other figure was 
only a computer rendering, but the resemblance to Linna was 
astounding. As a soft song about finding something that was thought 
forever lost played, Vision searched for &#39;Linna&#39; but always seemed one 
step behind. Threatened in an alley, she was rescued by &#39;Linna&#39; who 
held her gently for a moment, slipped a ring on her finger, then she 
was gone once again.

        Linna returned to the beginning and noted the title: 
&#39;Desperately wanting.&#39;

        &quot;What on Earth is going on?&quot; Linna asked herself softly.

        Over in the living room of Sylia&#39;s suite above the Silky Doll, 
the sounds of mirth could be heard. Sylia almost hooted with laughter, 
even as Tony walked over to take a look. &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Tony asked 
her curiously.

        &quot;I heard rumors about the Steel Angels being in town,&quot; Sylia 
smiled up at her from her seat, &quot;I was worried we might just have to 
do something about it.&quot;

        &quot;I take it we don&#39;t need to?&quot; Tony asked with a grin.

        &quot;Quincy launched a full strike team against the Angel,&quot; Sylia 
was clearly enjoying this, &quot;but it seems he didn&#39;t know that there 
were two of them in town.&quot;

        &quot;A bit of a oversight,&quot; Tony smirked.

        &quot;They let one boomer go, and followed it back to the base,&quot; 
Sylia waved to the screen, &quot;and now they&#39;re proceeding to trash every 
boomer on the property.&quot;

        Tony grinned, watching the image of the red and brown haired 
figures trashing a small army of boomers with a great deal of 
enjoyment. &quot;How did you manage to pull this off?&quot; she looked over at 
Sylia curiously.

        &quot;Just a wee bit of hacking of their systems,&quot; Sylia said 
modestly, &quot;nothing much to it.&quot; A bit more seriously she said, &quot;This 
is going to cost him big-time. Maybe enough to give me the edge to 
move against him in Genom at last.&quot;

        Tony put her hand on Sylia&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You know it there&#39;s 
anything I can do, just ask me.&quot; She hesitated a moment, &quot;Quincy won&#39;t 
let himself be voted off the Genom board without a fight.&quot;

        &quot;Which is why I&#39;m using the shell companies to purchase the 
stock,&quot; Sylia agreed. &quot;I&#39;m protected as long as he doesn&#39;t know who I 
am,&quot; she said.

        &quot;I just hope no one at Genom&#39;s clever enough to trace you,&quot; 
Tony said quietly.

        Sylia nodded, &quot;So do I.&quot;

        Quincy looked at the image sent to his desk in utter 
disbelief. The boomer storage facility had been reduced to a pile of 
rubble in the two Steel Angels&#39; wake, along with the hundreds of 
boomers that had been stored in there. A conservative estimate of the 
cost of repairing or replacing the facility would be in the hundreds 
of millions of dollars.

        &quot;How did this happen?&quot; Quincy finally asked weakly.

        &quot;The last boomer in the strike team we sent after the Steel 
Angel,&quot; Madigan said grimly, &quot;was so severely damaged that it 
attempted to return home for repairs. They followed it back there, and 
decided to send us a little message.&quot;

        Now that her own dismay was beginning to fade Madigan found 
herself getting angry. &#39;How dare they,&#39; she thought furiously, &#39;strike 
at a Genom facility! What gives them the right?&#39; And under that anger, 
if she was honest, was a bit of fear. &#39;What if they come here?&quot; was 
the question bothering her the most right about then.

        &quot;The shareholder&#39;s meeting is in less than two weeks,&quot; Quincy 
growled out, &quot;I can not afford an embarrassment like this on the 
books!&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s too big of a financial loss to try and bury,&quot; Madigan 
said quietly, wondering for a moment if the old man wasn&#39;t going to 
have a coronary.

        &quot;I know that,&quot; Quincy snarled. He called up files on his 
desktop, reviewing the information intently before saying, &quot;But we can 
spread the damage across many different divisions, reduce the apparent 
impact on the company.&quot;

        Madigan reviewed the data on her personal organizer and 
finally nodded thoughtfully, &quot;It could work.&quot; She frowned, &quot;But we&#39;ll 
need a fresh infusion of significant amounts of money as well, to help 
justify the movement of the different costs.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll just have to sell more stock,&quot; Quincy shrugged, calling 
up his portfolio file. He nodded thoughtfully, &quot;I still will have a 
majority of the stock, even with the sale.&quot;

        Madigan noted the numbers, and her eyes widened. &#39;Only by a 
very slim majority,&#39; she thought grimly. And if someone else acquired 
a majority? She rather suspected that her job security would very 
quickly disappear.

        &quot;I&#39;ll start making the necessary arrangements,&quot; Madigan said 
with a little bow to the chairman. The files and her personal 
organizer in hand she left the office, completely ignoring the 
cheerful greeting of the secretary. &#39;Investigating the companies 
buying up Genom stock just became a priority,&#39; she thought to herself 
grimly.

        &quot;Vision put you in her video?&quot; Nene blinked, sitting up in 
Akiko&#39;s arms with the phone pressed to her ear. They were being bad, 
slipping away to be together like this, but it didn&#39;t bother her too 
much. Linna&#39;s news, on the other hand, was a bit of a surprise.

        &quot;Certainly looks like it,&quot; Linna sighed. Her stockbroker&#39;s 
office was busy as usual, and she was working on her terminal even as 
she talked. &quot;What I don&#39;t know is what to do about it,&quot; she said to 
her friend quietly.

        &quot;Have you talked to her at all, after what happened?&quot; Nene 
asked. She giggled softly, from gentle fingers sliding across her 
ribcage. &quot;Stop that,&quot; she whispered to Akiko.

        Akiko tried to look innocent, but a little smile tugged her 
lips.

        &quot;I can tell what you&#39;ve been doing,&quot; Linna said teasingly. 
More seriously, &quot;I haven&#39;t talked to her. Vision had to go on with her 
tour, and it&#39;s not like we got to know each other all that well when I 
got caught up in her vendetta against Genom.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe you should try to see her, now that she&#39;s in Japan,&quot; 
Nene suggested. She tried not to moan, even though what Akiko was 
doing to her was pretty nice.

        &quot;She&#39;s in Japan?&quot; Linna squeaked in surprise. &quot;How come I 
didn&#39;t hear about it on her fan sites?&quot; she quickly asked.

        &quot;It&#39;s been kept pretty quiet,&quot; Nene said, &quot;I only found out 
because the AD Police keeps a close eye on her because of what 
happened.&quot;

        Linna sighed softly on seeing a call from a client coming up. 
&quot;I&#39;ve gotta go,&quot; Linna said regretfully and they said their good-byes.

        Akiko held Nene in her arms and asked, &quot;What was that all 
about?&quot;

        Nene finished setting the phone back in it&#39;s cradle and said, 
&quot;Vision visited Japan on tour a few months ago, but she also had 
another agenda.&quot; She snuggled in close to Akiko as she explained, &quot;Her 
sister had been killed as part of a Genom plot, and she wanted 
revenge. She kidnapped a Genom scientist and tried to use him to get 
at Quincy.&quot;

        &quot;So how did Linna get involved?&quot; Akiko asked.

        &quot;Linna had known Vision&#39;s sister, and saw the family 
resemblance. She followed Vision and got caught by people working for 
her,&quot; Nene edited the truth slightly.

        &quot;So she and Vision spent some time together,&quot; Akiko mused.

        &quot;And it looks like Linna made quite the strong impression,&quot; 
Nene agreed. Part of her wanted to tell Akiko everything, but she 
hesitated. It wasn&#39;t just herself that she&#39;d be putting at risk, it 
would be all of the Knight Sabers.

        &quot;Lets hope that Vision hasn&#39;t just come to Japan looking to 
fulfill some curiosity or something,&quot; Akiko murmured.

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Nene agreed. She looked up at Akiko, &quot;My friend Sylia 
is getting ready to hold another one of her parties in a week or so. 
Would you like to go with me as my date?&quot;

        Akiko smiled happily, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;

        &#39;I&#39;ll tell her at the party,&#39; Nene thought, relaxing in her 
arms.

        Linna sighed with relief as she shut the computer down. The 
trading had ended a few hours ago, but there was always more paperwork 
and messaging to do with various clients. She stretched, gasping 
slightly at the stiffness of her back.

        &#39;At least back when I was working at the gym,&#39; Linna thought 
to herself as she picked up her briefcase and locked up her office, &#39;I 
could get a massage easily enough.&#39; She considered some of the people 
around here who would likely volunteer to massage her and fought back 
a shudder.

        &quot;Someone walk over your grave?&quot; the security guard asked 
sympathetically. The black haired woman had a pleasant smile, but 
Linna was too distracted to really notice it.

        &quot;Odd thought,&quot; Linna smiled back and with a little wave &#39;bye 
entered the elevator bound downstairs. She walked through the lobby 
and fought down an strong surge of distaste at the boomer standing 
guard there. The doors swung open easily and she took a few steps to 
where her car was usually dropped off for her, only to freeze.

        The woman sat on the hood, sunglasses concealing her eyes, 
Short, styled brown hair framed an attractive face, her body sheathed 
in good quality clothing. She saw Linna there and smiled slightly.

        Linna forced herself to take the remaining steps towards her 
and softly said, &quot;Reika.&quot;

        Reika Chang smiled back, pushing herself off the car smoothly. 
She slid her sunglasses off and said, &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, Linna.&quot;

        The engagement ring that Linna had slid on Reika&#39;s finger 
months ago was still there, and looking into Reika&#39;s dark eyes she 
didn&#39;t seem to be so terribly haunted anymore. &quot;You look better,&quot; 
Linna managed to get out.

        &quot;Thanks to you,&quot; Reika said softly.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t do much,&quot; Linna looked away shyly.

        &quot;Only saved my life, and maybe my soul,&quot; Reika answered her. 
She hesitated, &quot;I wanted to ask you out to dinner, maybe make up a bit 
for how I treated you last time?&quot;

        Linna just knew this was a bad idea. She hardly knew anything 
about either of the woman&#39;s identities, Reika or Vision. So even she 
was mildly surprised when she found herself saying, &quot;I&#39;d love to go 
out to dinner with you.&quot;
