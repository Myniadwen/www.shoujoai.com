<a href="../arrest/friendluv-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Natsumi pushed her short brown hair back nervously, then she smiled as 
her eyes met Miyuki&#39;s own warm glance. She felt a bit better almost 
instantly, no matter how strange she might find their present 
surroundings to be.

And it was a pretty strange place Aoi had insisted on taking them all. 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket was a club owned by an old friend of Aoi&#39;s, so 
after receiving an invitation she insisted they all go. So she grabbed 
Yoriko, ordered them all to dress up, and then they arranged to meet 
at Natsumi and Miyuki&#39;s new apartment before leaving for the club.

Miyuki had noticed the odd girl in the school fuku by the door almost 
immediately, but thankfully she wasn&#39;t actually underage. Looking 
around, she saw a massive dance floor, a generously stocked bar, 
karaoke stage, and even a library to one side. A set of stairs led to 
an upper level and to who knows what.

&quot;Aren&#39;t we a little new at being a couple for a place like this?&#39; 
Miyuki finally asked Aoi, her long braid swinging behind her as they 
made their way over to a table.

Aoi chuckled softly, &quot;You&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Miyuki had to smile at all the admiring gazes Aoi got from the 
different ladies. Yoriko sure noticed it too, holding Aoi&#39;s arm while 
keeping close to her, all nonverbally crying out, &#39;Mine!&#39;

They got to the table, and Yoriko smiled broadly as Aoi held out the 
chair for her. She pushed it I gently, and Yoriko smiled up at her, 
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Natsumi quickly pulled out Miyuki&#39;s chair, and blushed at 
the gentle kiss on the cheek she received in return.

After a few moments Natsumi got tired of waiting to be served, so she 
waved her hand until a waitress arrived. She smiled up at the woman 
dressed in a maid&#39;s outfit from her seat and asked her, &quot;What would 
you recommend tonight?&quot;

The girl with a name-tag discreetly reading &#39;May&#39; rattled off a few 
options from memory before cheerfully finishing with, &quot;And the house 
special is also very good tonight.&quot;

Natsumi and Miyuki exchanged a glance, and then Miyuki said &quot;Two of 
the house special then, please.&quot; Aoi and Yoriko seconded that, adding 
a few drinks to the order.

May tucked her notebook away and bowed, &quot;Coming right up!&quot;

Two young ladies danced by the table, both of them dressed in skin 
tight costumes colored red and white. Oddly, the suits went well with 
their orange and blue hair colors.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Natsumi softly murmured, watching the bottoms sway on by. A 
sudden slap upside the head made her cry out, &quot;Ow!&quot;

Miyuki rolled her eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you.&quot;

Natsumi smiled at her as she pledged, &quot;I may look, but I&#39;d never 
stray.&quot;

&quot;So how are the new living arrangements going?&quot; Yoriko asked, ever the 
eternal gossip. She leaned forward slightly, her glasses catching the 
light as she waited to hear a answer.

Miyuki laughed softly, &quot;Except for her tendency to sleep in, it&#39;s 
great.&quot;

Natsumi blushed. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t sleep in so much if you weren&#39;t helping 
me stay up late,&quot; she pointed out, and Miyuki blushed, too.

Both Aoi and Yoriko laughed at that. &quot;Trust me,&quot; Aoi smiled, &quot;I know 
how that feels.&quot; She looked sideways at Yoriko, &quot;Still do, too.&quot;

May arrived at the table, followed right behind by another young woman 
dressed in a form fitting suit. They both began setting down plates 
and drinks, all the while exchanging glances that nearly screamed that 
they were a couple. &quot;I hope you enjoy your meal,&quot; May smiled, then she 
took her girlfriend&#39;s arm and left.

&quot;You two have been a couple for awhile, right?&quot; Natsumi asked. Both 
Aoi and Yoriko nodded, so she continued &quot;When did you two get 
together, then?&quot;

Aoi and Yoriko exchanged glances, then Aoi made a &#39;ladies first&#39; 
gesture. &quot;I was sort of interested from the start,&quot; Yoriko admitted to 
them quietly. &quot;I mean, from what I had researched about Aoi, I was 
curious, then when I was telling everyone all about him and finally 
gave the name...&quot; she trailed off.

Miyuki chuckled softly as she recalled, &quot;And then this feminine voice 
pipes up, &#39;Yes?&#39; and everything got really quiet.&quot;

Natsumi smiled over at Aoi, &quot;All the while we were trying to get you 
to act like a boy, you single handedly proved yourself the most 
feminine officer in the precinct.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; Aoi blushed.

&quot;I would,&quot; Yoriko smiled, reaching over to put her hand on Aoi&#39;s. &quot;But 
I couldn&#39;t believe how jealous I felt when that girl came to you for 
help,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;it just came right out of nowhere, and 
caught me off guard.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s how it started with you,&quot; Miyuki noted. She looked 
thoughtfully over at Aoi, &quot;How about you?&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t quite as fast as that for me,&quot; Aoi admitted, &quot;but I noticed 
her right from the start. Her smile, and her sunny personality.&quot; She 
took a sip from her drink, &quot;But it wasn&#39;t until her rival from the 
police academy showed up that I began to realize something else was 
going on.&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Natsumi said quietly, &quot;you were really worried for 
Yoriko&#39;s sake.&quot; A slight smile appeared on her face, &quot;I seem to 
remember that you were the only one willing to let her do things her 
own way, too.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Yoriko noted, giving Aoi a look.

Aoi blushed slightly, &quot;Yes, well. Anyway, we kept being put on the 
same shifts together, and I found that I liked her. Then I realized 
that I really, really liked her, but I was a bit too scared to risk 
the new friendship.&quot;

She paused for a moment, reflecting, then Aoi continued, &quot;It was on a 
Christmas night a few months later that I finally got up the nerve to 
do something. I saved up my money and booked a table for two at one of 
the better restaurants in town.&quot;

&quot;We were both on shift together,&quot; Yoriko noted, &quot;and Aoi seemed 
awfully nervous for some reason. Now you both know her almost as well 
as I do, and when is Aoi ever really nervous? So I just knew that 
something was up.&quot;

&quot;We went off duty, I changed out of uniform first, then Yoriko took 
her turn. We walked out together, and the snow began to gently fall 
all around us,&quot; Aoi said softly. Another small drink, and then, &quot;I 
asked her if she was going out on a Christmas date, and she said no. 
So I mustered up all my courage, and asked her out.&quot;

&quot;I thought it was a pity dinner at first,&quot; Yoriko admitted. &quot;Aoi just 
taking her poor single friend out or something like that,&quot; she 
shrugged comically.

Aoi chuckled softly, while Natsumi and Miyuki waited eagerly for more.

&quot;Eventually, thought, Aoi did get her point across,&quot; and Yoriko 
blushed faintly at the memory.

&quot;I think it was the after dinner dancing that finally did it,&quot; Aoi 
smiled, &quot;I made it pretty clear that I wasn&#39;t taking her out based 
just on friendship.&quot; She stopped then, looking down into Yoriko&#39;s eyes 
and seeming to be lost in them.

&quot;And?&quot; Miyuki asked, waiting to hear more.

&quot;And that&#39;s all I&#39;m telling your innocent ears for tonight,&quot; Aoi said 
firmly. She stood and offered her hand to Yoriko, &quot;Would you care to 
dance?&quot;

Yoriko smiled, &quot;Of course.&quot; She was swept into Aoi&#39;s arms as they 
swayed off together across the dance floor.

Miyuki sighed softly. &quot;If you can&#39;t beat them,&quot; she smiled at Natsumi, 
&quot;join them. Should we trip the light fantastic?&quot;

&quot;As long as no real tripping&#39;s involved,&quot; Natsumi laughed as she was 
pulled to her feet. They seemed to fit together, their bodies moving 
as one to the music.

A few moments of silence, then Miyuki said softly, &quot;I love you, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Natsumi smiled, and drew her down into a gentle 
kiss. </pre>
