<h1>Mecha Wars (part 23 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../arrest/index.html">You're Under Arrest</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../arrest/mechawars-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>        The morning sun was just rising as they all gathered as 
quietly as possible at the apparently abandoned old warehouse. Sylia 
Stingray directed them over to the large meeting room, looking as 
supremely confident as she usually did with her lover Antonia Stark 
standing by her side. They settled into their seats, the Knight 
Sabers, Priss&#39; Aunt Natsumi and her friends, Reika Chang, Akiko and 
her android daughters, Misaki, Hotoko, Kaede and Sae and finally 
Aiko and Biko.

        &quot;All right Sylia,&quot; Priss finally asked the question that was 
on everybody&#39;s mind, &quot;what&#39;s the plan to get you into Genom&#39;s Tower?&quot;

        Sylia smiled, giving Tony a fond look. She gazed back at the 
group as Tony dimmed the lights and activated the viewscreen behind 
Sylia, &quot;Here&#39;s what I propose we do..&quot;

        ... and hopefully that will do it,&quot; Sylia finished a few 
minutes later. As she finished speaking Mackie stepped up to get the 
lights, grinned slightly.


        Reika Chang looked at Sylia admiringly, &quot;You know, you have 
quite the evil streak.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Sylia smiled.

        &quot;I like your plan,&quot; Natsumi stood up, &quot;but it might help if 
you had a larger group of people to help confuse things.&quot;

        &quot;In fact,&quot; Aoi smiled wickedly, &quot;we have an older armored 
troop carrier that we bought used, one we usually just use to haul 
our more extreme bodyguard clients. Supposedly it can even take 
combat Boomer fire.&quot;

        &quot;It would help,&quot; Sylia admitted, &quot;but it would put you in 
substantial danger.&quot;

        Priss was looking over at her Aunt and friends 
thoughtfully. &quot;You&#39;re determined?&quot; she asked crisply. They all 
nodded and Priss looked at Sylia, &quot;I&#39;ll go with them. One of us 
would need to anyway, for your plan to work.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll form another group,&quot; Akiko spoke up, Nuku Nuku and 
Emi nearly jumping with eagerness. &quot;Nene?&quot; she looked over at her 
lover.

        &quot;I&#39;d better go with you,&quot; Nene agreed with Akiko, a gentle 
smile on her face, &quot;just to keep you all out of trouble.&quot;

        &quot;Where Linna goes, I go,&quot; Reika said crisply.

        &quot;Cousin?&quot; Tony looked over at Biko.

        &quot;Aiko and I can accompany Linna as well,&quot; Biko nodded.

        &quot;Should be fun,&quot; Aiko agreed, cracking her knuckles loudly.

        Sae stood up to speak for the other three Angelic Layer 
Deus, &quot;Would you like us to accompany you with the Saber Dolls? 
You&#39;ll be Genom&#39;s primary target if this fails.&quot;

        &quot;It won&#39;t fail,&quot; Sylia said firmly, &quot;and I want the Saber 
Dolls mobile, causing as much chaos and confusion for Gemon&#39;s forces 
as possible.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know if I like the fact that you and Tony are going 
to be out there on your own,&quot; Linna finally admitted.

        &quot;It&#39;s a risk,&quot; Sylia admitted, &quot;but I think it gives us the 
best chance of success.&quot; She paused, looking over the group, &quot;I have 
to remind you all of the dangers involved. This is a purely 
volunteer mission, and I won&#39;t think less of anyone who backs out.&quot;

        Priss got out of her seat, walking over to Sylia&#39;s side. She 
smiled slightly, meeting her friend&#39;s eyes as she took her hand, &quot;I 
was here at the beginning, I&#39;ll see it through to the end.&quot;

        &quot;That goes for me, too,&quot; Linna placed her hand over the 
other two.

        &quot;The Knight Sabers always stand by their own,&quot; Nene agreed 
with the others firmly, laying her hand over theirs.

        &quot;I think they speak for all of us,&quot; Miyuki rose up with a 
smile to speak for the others there, &quot;we&#39;re in this till the end.&quot;

        &quot;Then let&#39;s do it,&quot; Sylia agreed. She looked over at Mackie 
with a fond smile, &quot;You get to start work early, little brother. You 
and Nene are going to hack Genom.&quot;

        Mackie grinned evilly, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

        Nene smiled back, &quot;They&#39;ll never know what hit them.&quot;

        With that, the two computer hackers hurried over to the main 
data banks. Each grabbed a seat, and with a long-time familiarity 
they went to work. Despite their levity they knew how serious this 
situation was, and how little time they had to do this before they 
moved out.

        &quot;The suits are all prepared,&quot; Tony smiled. Four silvery 
boxes waited over by the side, about half the size of a person 
standing. &quot;I&#39;m still trying to talk Sylia into reducing the suits 
down to a suitcase container,&quot; she explained.

        Linna grabbed the handles on the top of one box, grunting as 
she picked it up about a foot, then thumped it down. &quot;Not light,&quot; 
she managed to gasp.

        Aiko reached out, hefting it easily. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; she 
smirked.

        Everyone rolled their eyes at that. &quot;You&#39;ve got a bit of an 
advantage, you know&quot; Biko pointed out to her lover wryly.

        &quot;So we just have to get to our positions around the city, 
and we&#39;ll all go at the same time.&quot; Priss tapped one of the 
cases, &quot;And the new modules are on them, right?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, they are,&quot; Tony smiled wickedly. &quot;There&#39;ll also be 
modules on the Saber Dolls, too. I just wish I could see Quincy&#39;s 
face one we activate them all,&quot; she chuckled.


        The upper floor office had a expanded viewscreen against one 
wall, a tactical display of the entire city showing on the screen. 
Boomers across the city showed as bright green spots on the gray 
background, and sensors planted on those Boomers were all set to 
detect one thing: the unique biological information of Sylia 
Stingray.

        Madigan looked up at the screen, then over to her employer 
behind his desk and came to a simple realization: he was desperate. 
This entire strategy was dangerously volatile, and if any of the 
Boomers went rogue it would be a disaster. Not to mention what would 
happen if any of this was leaked to either the media or the board.

        &quot;When is she going to move,&quot; Quincy growled, staring at the 
screen.

        As soon as Sylia&#39;s unique bio-signature was spotted, it 
would appear on the screen as a red marker. The data would then be 
instantly passed on to the Boomers now patrolling the city, and they 
would all converge on the target. With the mix of military and 
regular Boomers that were out there, it would be a massacre.

        &quot;There&#39;s still two hours before the meeting,&quot; Madigan kept 
her voice calm and steady, &quot;and if she&#39;s smart, she&#39;ll stay under 
cover for as long as possible.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Quincy sighed. From the look on his face, he seemed 
to be deeply in thought. &quot;How could I have underestimated someone so 
completely,&quot; he murmured, &quot;I never even suspected that she might be 
moving against me.&quot;

        Madigan decided to answer that as seriously as she 
could. &quot;Sylia&#39;s occupation was the perfect cover,&quot; she pointed 
out, &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone would have considered the operator of the 
Silky Doll lingerie shop to be a major player in Megatokyo.&quot;

        &quot;She is her father&#39;s daughter,&quot; Quincy murmured, still 
staring at the viewscreen.

        There was a loud chirp, and both looked up. A red mark had 
appeared, on the north part of town. Madigan smiled grimly as the 
Boomers began to move, &quot;We&#39;ve got her.&quot;

        Another loud chirp, and a red mark appeared to the south of 
the city. Then a blip appeared on the west side, then four more 
blips began to move out from seemingly nowhere, creating even 
greater chaos. The small army of Boomers seemed unable to choose a 
target, as the blips all began to converge on Genom&#39;s Tower.

        The two of them gazed in surprise at the screen, then Quincy 
began to laugh. &quot;Sir?&quot; Madigan looked over at him in concern.

        &quot;Sylia deduced what we were going to do,&quot; Quincy chuckled 
softly, &quot;and she&#39;s parried us. We&#39;ve got to split up the Boomers, 
try to stop all of the blips.&quot;

        Madigan grabbed a terminal, working to reassign the boomers 
to attack each target in their respective sectors. &quot;Who could she 
have gotten to pretend to be her?&quot; she asked, typing quickly on one 
of the control panels.

        &quot;The Knight Sabers,&quot; Quincy said to her grimly, &quot;she had to 
have hired them to do this. Them, and three of their allies.&quot;

        &quot;Dividing our forces means we have less chance to stop 
them,&quot; Madigan finished the programming, her finger hovering over 
the execute key.

        &quot;Do it,&quot; Quincy said simply.


        The blue Knight Saber stood on top of the armored transport, 
the vehicle bumping a bit as they raced down the street. &quot;Look&#39;s 
like it&#39;s working,&quot; Priss reported in over her suit&#39;s radio, &quot;the 
Chameleon modules has the Boomers thinking all of us are you.&quot;

        Sylia&#39;s voice came through loud and clear, &quot;Watch 
yourselves, everyone. The boomers won&#39;t stay confused for very long.&quot;

        &quot;Called that right,&quot; Priss murmured as the first few Boomers 
appeared in their path.

        Before she could even move her Aunt Natsumi stuck her head 
out of the passenger&#39;s side. The Boomer-buster coughed once, even as 
Yoriko popped the sidedoor and opened up. The Boomers fireballed, 
the armored carrier bouncing through the flames.

        &quot;Save your firepower,&quot; Natsumi ordered crisply, &quot;we&#39;re going 
to need it when we get nearer to the Tower itself.&quot;

        &quot;More Boomers coming,&quot; Yoriko yelled, light glinting off her 
glasses.

        &quot;I see them,&quot; Miyuki yelled, twisting the wheel hard as she 
reached over to help brace her lover Natsumi. &quot;It&#39;s going to get 
rougher before we reach Genom&#39;s Tower.&quot;

        &quot;I know,&quot; Aoi murmured, hefting a Boomer-buster awkwardly

        In another part of the city a motorcycle came around a 
corner, two figures riding together. Before the Boomer waiting there 
could even react a missile shot from the bike, reducing it to 
scrap. &quot;I have to ask Sylia how she designed these Motoslaves,&quot; 
Reika grinned, handling the bike like a pro.

        &quot;Good luck,&quot; Linna murmured, riding just behind her lover on 
the cycle.

        Biko curved back, flying down to their side to report, &quot;More 
Boomers are coming, though I dropped out Aiko to deal with another 
group.&quot; There was a loud series of explosions and the armored woman 
smiled, &quot;I think she has the situation under control.&quot;

        A few moments later Aiko came running around the corner. The 
redhead&#39;s clothes were trailing smoke, but other than that she was 
unharmed. &quot;That was fun,&quot; she beamed.

        &quot;Oh, grow up,&quot; Biko muttered.

        &quot;I don&#39;t see you holding back,&quot; Aiko shot back.

        &quot;Do you think Tony asked us to take them along as some kind 
of punishment?&quot; Linna whispered to Reika, and the other woman shook 
with laughter.

        Meanwhile, in another part of the city a battered jeep 
barreled along, Akiko and Nene sitting in the front seat 
together. &quot;Gotta watch out for those near misses,&quot; Akiko muttered as 
she used her fist to clear out the remaining broken glass from the 
windshield.

        Nene&#39;s pink armor had it&#39;s antenna array spread out, the 
pilot listening intently to what was going on around them. &quot;The 
Boomers are badly scattered,&quot; she reported, &quot;and the Saber Dolls are 
confusing things even more.&quot;

        &quot;Yeah!&quot; Nuku Nuku beamed as she ran along beside the jeep, 
the android&#39;s long hair flowing behind her like a banner.

        &quot;We&#39;d better stay ready,&quot; Emi cautioned, flying just above 
them, &quot;there&#39;s still a ways to go until we reach the Tower.

        &quot;Oh, shit,&quot; Nene murmured, seeing the flight of Boomers that 
were now heading towards them, &quot;combat models.&quot;

        &quot;Whee, fun,&quot; Nuku Nuku beamed, even as Akiko and Nene both 
sweatdropped.
