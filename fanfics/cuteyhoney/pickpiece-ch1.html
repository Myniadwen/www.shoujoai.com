<h1>Picking Up the Pieces</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../cuteyhoney/index.html">Cutey Honey</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Natsuko Aki stood before her superiors, her squarish glasses gleaming as 
the black suited woman waited patiently at attention. The commissioner, 
looking more than a bit battered from his recent trials with Gold Claw 
and Sister Jill sighed, a bandage wrapped around his head, &quot;We&#39;d... 
rather not accept your resignation, detective.&quot;

Natsuko narrowed her eyes just a bit as she restrained her anger, black 
bangs hanging just above her eyes. &quot;I can no longer serve in a police 
force,&quot; she said to them coldly, &quot;who would desert a city in need.&quot;

Wiping at his bald head with a already soaked cloth another official 
blurted, &quot;But we were under orders...&quot;

&quot;A true police officer,&quot; Natsuko cut him off, &quot;would ignore such 
orders.&quot; She swept the group of four men with her eyes, &quot;But I think we 
all know that you&#39;re just politicians.&quot; With that she reached into her 
suit coat and took out her badge, slapping it down onto the table before 
unloading her usual stash of weapons.

&quot;But... what will we do if the city&#39;s in danger?&quot; a third official 
squeaked out, clearly terrorized by the thought of losing their only 
effective officer.

Natsuko paused at the door of the meeting room, torn between annoyance 
and a lingering sense of duty. &quot;I&#39;m thinking of going into private 
investigations,&quot; she answered them coldly, &quot;but I won&#39;t be as cheap as I 
was as a police officer.&quot;

There was a odd silence as Natsuko walked down the halls of the police 
headquarters to her desk a final time, collecting her few remaining 
personal items. The farewells had all been said earlier that day, and 
she took the time to talk to her two closest subordinates and try to 
encourage them to carry on as best they could. Of course she had no 
illusions on how difficult it was going to be for the police now that 
Cutey Honey was gone, but she knew that she couldn&#39;t continue on here 
any longer.

Leaving by the front doors Natsuko&#39;s eyes widened as she saw a man 
lounging against her car, his manner deceptively casual. &quot;Seiji,&quot; 
Natsuko said grimly, meeting the man&#39;s eyes as she strode over to him.

&quot;Ah, Na-chan...urk!&quot; Seiji Hayami choked as Natsuko grabbed him by the 
throat, her grip far stronger than most women. &quot;Help,&quot; Seiji squeaked.

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; Natsuko said to him coldly, only her eyes showing 
her fury, &quot;only SHE gets to call me that.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; pushing his cap back in place Seiji nodded and she let him go. 
&quot;Nice to see you&#39;re so full of energy,&quot; he said a bit more normally, 
&quot;are you... all right?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Natsuko said flatly, &quot;and now that we&#39;ve got the pleasantries out 
of the way, I want some answers.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what I can,&quot; Seiji admitted.

&quot;You and that old lady, Sweep,&quot; Natsuko said seriously, &quot;you were with 
the government... what did they have to do with Sister Jill?&quot;

&quot;The government sponsored Kisaragi&#39;s creation of Sister Jill,&quot; Seiji 
said with a frown, &quot;it&#39;s classified, but considering how much you 
already know it can&#39;t hurt to tell you.&quot;

&quot;Why would they do something so foolish?&quot; Natsuko sounded frustrated, 
but she could easily believe it.

&quot;Because the potential for an artificial soldier overwhelmed them,&quot; 
Seiji shrugged. &quot;Then Jill escaped, created her Claws and...&quot;

&quot;All hell broke loose,&quot; Natsuko said grimly.

&quot;Working on his own Kisaragi then created Honey, but he was attacked by 
Jill&#39;s forces before he could bring her online,&quot; Seiji said, &quot;she awoke 
afterward, killing the attacker then declaring her intent to avenge her 
father.&quot;

&quot;At least she accomplished that, before she...&quot; Natsuko trailed off 
sadly.

Seiji looked away from her pain uncomfortably. It had been less than a 
week since Cutey Honey had saved Tokyo from a nuclear strike... a blast 
that Honey had been at ground zero of. Somehow she had transmuted all of 
the radiation and blast wave into light, but Honey herself hadn&#39;t been 
seen since.

&quot;The I system that gave Honey her powers,&quot; Seiji finally said, &quot;we still 
don&#39;t know what it&#39;s limits are. It&#39;s possible she&#39;s still alive.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m hoping,&quot; Natsuko confessed.

&quot;If I hear anything, find out anything more about Honey,&quot; Seiji said to 
her quietly, &quot;I promise I&#39;ll let you know.&quot;

&quot;Won&#39;t you get in trouble doing that,&quot; Natsuko asked with thinly 
disguised sarcasm, &quot;Mr. Government Agent?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care, policewoman,&quot; Seiji firmly answered, &quot;at the very least, 
I owe it to Honey.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Natsuko managed a smile before she got into the sports car.

It didn&#39;t take long to get home, but Natsuko wished it took longer. She 
didn&#39;t want to go home, and face the emptiness of the townhouse next 
door, the home that Honey Kisaragi had lived in. It was odd how someone 
she had known for such a short time could influence Natsuko so much, but 
she supposed that was how love went.

&quot;Love,&quot; Natsuko sighed, sitting in her car a moment. Yes, she supposed 
she did love Honey... had loved her since that endearing bubble-head had 
tried to entice her with dinner. Part of why she had tried to push honey 
away then had been fear of that love, a emotion Natsuko still felt more 
than a bit of fear from.

With a weary sigh Natsuko walked up to the door, reaching out to take 
the doorknob only to realize that it was open a crack. &#145;What in the...?&#39; 
she wondered, cautiously pushing open the door to peek inside...

&quot;NA-Chan!&quot; a happy voice squealed as she was suddenly hit by a very 
enthusiastic flying blonde tackle.

&quot;Honey?!&quot; Natsuko blurted as she caught her in her arms, Honey&#39;s full 
breasts pushing against her own. &quot;You&#39;re alive?!&quot;

Honey didn&#39;t let go, still holding on to Natsuko as she said sweetly, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Na-chan, I never meant to worry you.&quot;

Also holding on to Honey Natsuko got them both inside, deciding their 
reunion was best kept off the street. &quot;What happened to your clothes?&quot; 
Natsuko blinked, blushing a bit as she realized she was holding a curvy 
and naked blonde.

Honey&#39;s stomach growled loudly in the silence of the apartment. &quot;Sorry,&quot; 
Honey blushed, &quot;I&#39;m kind of hungry.&quot;

Natsuko fought back a chuckle, &quot;That&#39;s my Honey.&quot; They made their way to 
the kitchen as she asked, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you just make something yourself?&quot;

&quot;I felt bad enough sneaking into your house,&quot; Honey smiled, leaning on 
the kitchen counter and causing her breasts to bounce a bit, &quot;stealing 
your food would be even worse.&quot;

Getting some fruit out Natsuko sliced it up, then passed the plate over, 
watching affectionately as Honey scarfed it down. After serving Honey a 
few more plates of food the pretty blonde looked a bit less like she was 
starving, and Natsuko felt it was time to ask her, &quot;What happened to 
you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Honey admitted as she ate a rice ball, &quot;There was a 
explosion, I used the I system... then I was in the park, naked.&quot;

&quot;That had to have been interesting,&quot; Natsuko blinked.

&quot;I was too exhausted to transform,&quot; Honey sighed, &quot;so I snuck down the 
back alleys to get back home.&quot;

&quot;Why not go to...?&quot; Natsuko half gestured to the townhouse Honey had 
been living in beside her own.

Honey actually blushed, &quot;I wanted to be here... with you.&quot;

Natsuko felt a rare smile tugging at her lips, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

&quot;Na-chan,&quot; Honey looked up to meet her eyes.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Natsuko asked, feeling a moment of electricity as she met those 
sweet blue eyes.

&quot;Do you remember when I was Jill&#39;s captive?&quot; Honey asked.

Natsuko actually blushed faintly. Sister Jill had created a monsterous 
copy of herself, holding Honey bound in the crown of her giant self. 
Natsuko had reached her side with the assistance of Seiji and a jet 
fighter, but to awaken Honey had required medication... delivered 
through a kiss to the out-cold woman&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Natsuko kept her voice even with effort.

Honey&#39;s eyes actually twinkled, &quot;Could we do it again?&quot;

End

Notes: Re: Cutey honey ends with the battle with Jill, then fast 
forwards to Honey &amp; Na-chan in what looks like a detective agency 
together. Thought it might be fun to toss together a &quot;bridging&quot; fic for 
the series.</pre>
