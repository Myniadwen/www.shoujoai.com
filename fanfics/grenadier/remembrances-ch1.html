Chapter 1: Rushuna<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br><br>

<i>Tendou Rushuna ran along the brightly-lit corridor leading to the
Empress's orchard, her gold-colored eyes focused straight in front of 
her
as her dark pink boots clacked against the stone floor.  Her long 
blonde
hair flared behind as she ran, as did her white slit skirt and straw
hat.  The dark pink forearm guards she wore were clenched tight, as if
worried themselves.  Her bountiful chest rose and fell with the harsh
breaths of exertion, and her dark pink top and white sleeveless vest
were beginning to show hints of sweat.
<br><br>
She had to know the truth.  She had to see the Empress and find out if
she did indeed send the Ten Senshi Sages to kill her.  It was so odd.
She had never once suspected that someone so kind as the Empress would
even consider doing something like sending assassins after someone,
especially since Rushuna knew that she had done nothing wrong.  She was
following the Empress's philosophy of erasing the enemy's will to fight
to the letter, something even Touka had acknowledged and appreciated.

<br><br>No, something was very wrong.
<br><br>
She wondered as she ran, 'What kind of person is the Empress now?'</i>
<br><br>
It was night in the Heavenly Capital, the city that was a rare bastion
of beauty in a land torn by war.  It soared high on brick and board and
bough alike, with a vastness that did much to hide what was going on
outside the walls.
<br><br>
One such happening was the selection of female students in the nearby
Ten Senshi Sages Reserve school for a special assignment.  These
students were selected as candidates for being the Empress's double,
acting as a public face and personal defense for the Empress against 
any
bold rebels or ambitious warlords.  They were selected according to 
face
shape, height, martial training, and attention to detail.  Therefore,
the ideal double could easily pass for the Empress at a distance - both
by virtue of facial resemblance and their consummate recreation of her
mannerisms - and proved a quick and deadly surprise for anyone who
managed to get close enough to spot the differences.
<br><br>
"The two candidates chosen to undergo training to become the Empress's
double are...Oomidou Setsuna and Tendou Rushuna!"
<br><br>
The two girls in question were both flabbergasted at the news, and
neither looked entirely sure of the decision.  Setsuna's green eyes 
were
tinged with a sense of resignation, while Rushuna's gold were more
curious than anything.  Neither of them, in all this time, had even 
seen
the Empress.  None of the students had.  While one of their trainers 
had
been a Sage in his youth, he had not seen the Empress - in his time, 
she
hadn't been born yet - and the rest of their trainers said nothing of
what they knew of her, concentrating solely on imparting martial
knowledge.  In this, they had been most thorough; despite their 
youthful
age of thirteen, the final remaining candidates for both Empress 
doubles
and Senshi Sages already ranked among the elite soldiers of the 
Heavenly
 Capital's army.  Each was allowed to develop his or her own talents,
which proved to make effective and motivated students of them.  While
not all of the Ten would need replacing, any among this group of
students would be equal to the task of replacing any given member of 
the
Ten, if and when the time came.
<br><br>
"Oomidou Setsuna!  Tendou Rushuna!  At attention!"
<br><br>
The sudden barked command triggered the appropriate snap to attention 
as
the two young women replied, "Orders, sir?"
<br><br>
"The Empress will meet you two tomorrow, and you will be given further
directions then.  In the meantime, pack up your belongings and prepare
for tomorrow."
<br><br>
With a bow, the two immediately made for the girls' dormitory, talking
among themselves quietly along the way.
<br><br>
Setsuna spoke in a low voice, her face kept neutral.  "What do you
think, Rushuna?"
<br><br>
The sprightly blonde in question shrugged with a smile.  "I don't know.
At least this means we've done well here, right?"
<br><br>
"Yeah...but still.  Why'd they choose us?"
<br><br>
"You know the reasons.  Apart from being good shots, we're supposed to
look like the Empress."
<br><br>
Setsuna snorted, glancing at both of their developing bodies.  Both of
them were already somewhat voluptuous figures, despite still being
young.  "I bet there's another reason they picked us."
<br><br>
Rushuna blinked, then caught the direction of Setsuna's gaze.  After a
few giggles, she said, "Oh, I don't think so...unless Teppa made the
decision."
<br><br>
Both of them had a good laugh at the idea as they entered the dormitory
and began packing.  Because of their austere training, they had few
things: some clothes and a few toiletries were all that they needed to
put away.  As the two laid on their respective beds, Setsuna spoke
again.
<br><br>
"Rushuna...what do you think the Empress will be like?"
<br><br>
"If we're supposed to look like her, then we already have a clue."
<br><br>
"No, not that.  I mean...what kind of person do you think she is?"
<br><br>
Rushuna thought a bit, her hand on her chin.  After a little while, she
shrugged.  "I don't know.  I guess we'll have to see."
<br><br>
"....I hope she's a good person."
<br><br>
"Me too."
<br><br>
Concerns notwithstanding, the two of them slept soundly.
<br><br>
<i>'The ultimate strategy...this is where she taught it to me.'
<br><br>
Everything was the same.  Tendou Rushuna took in the sights of the
orchard where she spent much time studying the Empress and practicing
her habits.  An outer ring of taller trees bordered the ring of peach
trees next to the path, which meandered around the orchard and across
the ponds via a small bridge leading to a small, sealed gazebo.  In
times past, the breeze would have carried delicate peach blossom petals
from branch to air, swirling along the stone path that itself ringed a
series of small ponds.  Now, the orchard was still, but had the same
look as back then.
<br><br>
'It's the same as before.  I just know the Empress can't have changed.'
<br><br>
Everything was the same.  Everything was as it was her first time
here.</i>
<br><br>
Daybreak found the two of them already on the way to the Palace, and
they marveled at the view that it presented during the brilliant
sunrise.  Already a marvel of architecture with its intriguing blend of
Western and Eastern styles, the combination of squared pillars,
cylindrical chambers, and domed roofs filled with an intricate network
of frames and glass fairly sparkled with flecks of orange and gold as
the morning began.  Privately, though both girls were dazzled by the
display, they were focused on something else.  Rushuna wasn't sure what
Setsuna was thinking of, but she herself was wondering at the question
Setsuna asked last night.
<br><br>
What kind of person would the Empress be?
<br><br>
A few minutes later, Rushuna would have her answer.  At the end of the
corridor was a vast orchard, filled with peach trees that were not yet
ready to bear fruit.  The path they followed led them to a gazebo in 
the
middle of one of ponds that made up the center, and inside was a young
woman, about the girls' age, calmly inspecting a bonsai tree that 
looked
thick with branches in all directions.  She wore a voluminous formal
kimono of white, lavendar, and seafoam green, the floor-brushing 
garment
adding to the illusion of floating that her delicate grace was to 
imply.
Around her waist was a blue obi, tied in front in a simple bow.  Locks
of her hair were bound in rings to an ornate gold headdress, shaped 
like
a cross with finely-wrought golden cords weighted with tassels dangling
down from each extremity.
<br><br>
"Your Highness, they are here."
<br><br>
The Empress turned towards them, and Rushuna found herself staring.
Though certainly of similar, though a bit less generously endowed,
build, the Empress's face was something else entirely.  She'd heard 
that
often women would paint themselves to attain the fair complexion prized
by nobles, but the face in front of Rushuna offered two possibilities.
<br><br>
Either the Empress's handmaidens were incredibly skilled, or there 
wasn't
a hint of makeup anywhere on her.
<br><br>
With a sweet smile, the Empress nodded in acknowledgement of the two
potential doubles, her neatly combed hair dipping to frame the yellow
sunburst tattoo on her forehead.  "Welcome.  Might I have the pleasure
of asking your names?"
<br><br>
Rushuna found herself liking the Empress very much already.  Her voice
said much about her.  Though her words could be spoken by haughty
merchants or dismissive nobles, they would certainly have not been the
same as those that issued from her delicate mouth.  While soft, her 
tone
 carried a certain dignity and a sense of...joy.  She was happy,
genuinely happy, to be in the presence of these two people who she
didn't even know.
<br><br>
"I'm Oomidou Setsuna, Your Highness," replied the brunette, bowing in
formality.
<br><br>
"That is a wonderful name.  Oomidou Setsuna it is, then.  And you
are...?"
<br><br>
Bowing much the same as Setsuna, the reply began, "My name is-"
<br><br>
<i>"Rushuna?  Is that Rushuna?"
<br><br>
That voice...could it be?  Rushuna quickly looked towards the bridge
over the stream in the center of the orchard.  It was!
<br><br>
"I have been waiting for you, Rushuna."
<br><br>
"Your Highness..."
<br><br>
Rushuna's smile was wide as she ran towards the woman who had,
essentially, given her real purpose and belief.  Her face was stil the
same as it was, ever since Rushuna had first seen her.  The relaxed,
smooth features that nevertheless always naturally curled into a
smile...those delicate eyebrows and lashes that tilted with placid
acceptance...her regal outfit that could even have been made of rough
country material, but would have still looked like the finest silk
caught in her graceful movements...everything about her was the same as
it was before.</i>
<br><br>
While no less difficult than her earlier training, Rushuna was much 
more
relaxed in this atmosphere.  Instead of dodging rocks and shooting
targets, she was analyzing the Empress's mannerisms and habits.  Only a
perfect performance would do, and so both doubles-in-training would 
have
to be very attentive.  On her end, Rushuna had been closely eyeing her
everywhere she went by using the numerous false walls throughout the
palace.  Periodically, she would try out the motions herself behind the
wall, trying to make herself comfortable with the delicate, understated
manner in which the Empress moved.  It was almost like learning to
dance...except her lead was always at least a few feet away from her
and the music started and stopped whenever it wanted.
<br><br>
Shortly put, it was difficult going.
<br><br>
Still, she was by no means overwhelmed.  Quite the opposite,
really...she was intrigued.  The Empress was her own age - fifteen - 
but
the two of them were worlds apart, it seemed.  While she seemed
perpetually sunny, there was something else too.  Even under the stare
of countless guards and the studious observations of her two doubles-
in-training, she moved a little too reservedly.  Many of her movements
seemed to be...cut short.  Her recent words, unlike the first ones
Rushuna heard in the gazebo, were often too polite, with little
inflection of emotion.  It didn't fit with what Rushuna saw her first
day here, and though that could have been the exception rather than the
rule, it made her conclusion no less certain.
<br><br>
The Empress was hiding something.
<br><br>
Still, Rushuna liked this hiding.  It made things...well...almost fun.
She rather felt the part of a detective as much as she felt the part of
a double.  Whether this "something" that the Empress was hiding was
harmful or not never entered the blonde's mind.  She knew that if it 
was
something truly important, the Empress would discuss it with someone,
sometime.
<br><br>
"-nyone there?  Perhaps we might have a word with each other."
<br><br>
The query brought Rushuna out of her daydream...which really didn't
apply, considering it was night.  Specifically, she was in a false wall
with a one-sided window allowing a view into the spacious bedroom.
While partly obscured by curtains and pillars, the view was simply
opulent, with flares of gold and white and light pink arrayed in a
spacious, formal style.  While certainly nice for sightseeing, Rushuna
figured that it wouldn't be very cozy.  The Empress was standing near
her canopy bed dressed in a light diaphanous sleeping gown, a perfect
compliment to her almost-sculpted beauty.  Her nearly-white hair, so
often coiffed and confined in or around an elaborate headdress, was 
worn
completely down, and reached almost to her knees.  Any observer would
find the sight mesmerizing.
<br><br>
"Is anyone there?" came the question once more.
<br><br>
Again, the young blonde blinked away the ruminations.  The Empress 
often
tried to talk to the people behind the walls, whether they were her
guards or her new doubles-in-training.  It must be lonely being in
charge.
<br><br>
Normally Rushuna would answer right away, and the two of them would 
chat
with each other for hours.  Their thoughts on just about anything were
fair game, and she and Setsuna agreed that the Empress was a pleasant
conversationalist, if a touch reserved.  This type of casual conduct 
was
not exactly condoned, but it allowed the doubles-in-training to learn
more about the Empress's habits and favorite topics, and so it was let
go.  Now, however, for some reason Rushuna couldn't bring herself to
speak.  Why she didn't brought a puzzled furrow to her brow...she'd
always loved their talks.
<br><br>
No, this was ridiculous.  She shouldn't hide from the Empress.  It was
just silly!
<br><br>
Her mouth opened to reply with a "I'm here, Your Highness," but...
<br><br>
"...I see.  They must be asleep...or outside the door," the Empress
thought aloud, delicately crawling onto her soft bed.
<br><br>
Rushuna's words stopped short of coming out, and she waited instead, 
her
curiosity rising.  The Empress's voice wasn't entirely
resigned...actually, she sounded a little relieved.
<br><br>
"My apologies, but privacy is also something that is wonderful to have
sometimes," the Empress continued, to no one in particular.
<br><br>
Before Rushuna could make any sense of what the Empress was talking
about, the slender girl smiled as she lay down and began running her
hands over her body, her soft, elegant curves visible through the thin
fabric.
<br><br>
"I've been waiting so long..."
<br><br>
Rushuna's eyes couldn't flinch away from the scene.  The Empress's eyes
were shut in bliss as she feathered her hand down over her face, 
licking
her fingers in passing before moving them further down, bunching up her
gown to get at her soft entrance.  Her other hand, meanwhile, was busy
kneading her ample bosom, moving whichever way inspiration guided her.
Her mouth, so often curled in a kind smile, was now open, letting out
sharp breaths and exclamations of pleasure.  Her legs curled and her
back arched as her hand brushed what Rushuna guessed was a sensitive
spot, something that brought a small blush to the girl's cheeks.
<br><br>
"I have dreamt of this so much...you are everything for which I have
hoped..."
<br><br>
The phrasing caught Rushuna's ear as well as the deft movements of the
Empress's hands caught her eye, and she silently wondered of whom the
Empress had "dreamt" in this situation so much.  Some noble, with power
and wealth?  Surely, such a thought would appeal to many country girls,
but the Empress was, needless to say, in another realm entirely.  She
had wealth.  She had power.  The lures of such things only have appeal
to those lacking them.
<br><br>
"Such soft, wonderful skin..."
<br><br>
The Empress's tongue traced her lips lightly, her light squeals issuing
forth in time with her increasingly insistent finger thrusts.  
Likewise,
her other hand was roaming and groping her breasts with greater
intensity as she fairly writhed on her bed.  When she puckered her
lips, arching to kiss a mouth that wasn't there, Rushuna considered 
what
this could mean.  Soft skin?  Maybe it was a noble after all.  Farmers
and the like couldn't possibly avoid having at least a few blemishes.
<br><br>
Then again, the Empress had never seemed the like to enjoy the company
of most nobles.  There were kind ones, sure enough, but far too many 
who
insisted on power and prestige, or on comfort at the expense of others.
<br><br>
Throughout all Rushuna's musings, she was still observant of the
Empress'spassionate actions, watching the noble's body twist this way
and that as her hands roamed over her flawless skin as she imagined
herself in the throes of lovemaking with another.  Really, it was 
almost
guaranteed that few would be able to turn away from the mesmerizing
scene before her, whether out of shock or enjoyment.  Now the Empress
had turned such that she was on her knees, her face laid on its side
against her bed as her hands worked in and out of her sex, her hips
rocking back to intensify the feelings that were certainly almost to a
boil inside her.  Her whispers of praise and encouragement to her
imagined partner gave way to wordless mewls and whimpers as her
pleasure-wracked body jerked in orgasm, her movements and exclamations
finally managing to bring a blush to Rushuna's cheeks.
<br><br>
While the Empress lay back and smoothed out her clothing, luxuriating
in the afterglow of her climax and sucking delicately on her fingers to
clean them, Rushuna blinked and realized that, during her unintentional
bout of voyeurism, she had stood up, and was leaning forward for a
better view, besides.  Sitting back down, she rested her chin in her
hand and tried to sort things out.
<br><br>
'Would the Empress be upset if I told her I saw?'
<br><br>
'Who was she dreaming about?'
<br><br>
The first question, at least to her, was obvious.  The Empress didn't
seem the type to get mad for something like that, especially if it was
an accident...
<br><br>
'Was it really an accident? Staying certainly wasn't an accident.'
<br><br>
Rushuna's eyebrows tilted upwards, her eyes wide.  True, she could have
left any time she wanted.  Then again, the sight was so shocking that
the thought of leaving never entered her mind.
<br><br>
'Shocking?  You're sure you don't mean anything else?
Say...interested?'
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Alright, fine.  Interested too.
<br><br>
Anyway, the second question was next.  She didn't say much in
specifics - and really, who would in such a situation? - so there 
really
wasn't much to go on.  "Soft, wonderful skin" didn't really narrow the
list down much either.
<br><br>
As she got up to head to her room, Rushuna finally asked herself the
question she considered most important.
<br><br>
'Why does all of this matter to me?'
<br><br>
<i>"Your Highness!"
<br><br>
There was no doubt in her mind that the Ten Senshi Sages were not sent
as assassins at this woman's bidding.  How could it be this kind woman,
who ordered this beautiful orchard of sakura trees kept so immaculate,
and enjoyed it so much?  How could she be the one to force combat after
combat on her, and then have the losers killed in cold blood?  The 
river
water in this orchard always ran clear, and so did the Empress's heart,
free of hatred and ill will.  She taught her to smile so serenely.  She
taught her how to care for people who did not return such feelings.  
She
taught her to feel affection for strangers.  She taught her...</i>
<br><br>
"Would you deign to join me in the bath, Rushuna?"
<br><br>
Bathing was always welcome for her - with all the hard training they
went through at the Ten Senshi Sages Reserve school, every bath was a
welcome respite....and yet somehow the blonde in question found herself
wavering on whether to say yes or no.
<br><br>
"Is Setsuna coming too?" the blonde finally asked, wearing a pleasant
smile.
<br><br>
"I had asked her earlier, but she refused."
<br><br>
...Well, that meant it would just be the two of them.  She couldn't
decide on whether that was a good or bad thing.  Honestly, she couldn't
even fathom why she felt that she had to make such a decision.  It's
just a bath...two naked people in water.  What was the harm?
<br><br>
"I would be honored, Your Highness."
<br><br>
A bright smile lit up the Empress's face and she let out a breath that
she didn't seem entirely aware that she was holding.  "I am very glad.
Please, follow me.  I will have my maids fetch your clothes for you."
<br><br>
It was a few minutes later when the tub - really more of a small pool -
found itself holding a sight that would have made any interested party
weak in the knees.  Two beautiful women lounged in the tiered bath that
took up the entirety of the tower's highest floor, their shapely forms
partly concealed by the mist floating just above the hot water.  They
spoke and laughed, sharing stories about fiction, life, and friends.
The Empress mostly spoke of life in the palace, and certain funny
stories involving admirers among the guard.  Rushuna responded with
details of her time training to be one of the Ten Senshi Sages, as well
as numerous accounts of a certain friendly, perverted heir to the Aizen
clan attempting to "appreciate" her developing figure.  Each story
concluded with giggles from both young women ringing into the night,
carrying far in the moonlit air.
<br><br>
"-as he really at fault?"
<br><br>
"Probably not, Your Highness.  After all, I think he means well."
<br><br>
"He sounds like he does.  Besides, he'd much rather have what such
garments hide, yes?"
<br><br>
Merry trills of laughter again filled the room, echoing out the bare
windows.  This, however, faded quickly, one out of introspection and 
one
out of concern.
<br><br>
"Your Highness?  Are you well?"
<br><br>
The Empress's eyes were downcast, her smile gone. Though not an
unpleasant face to make, the change from her usual serene joy was 
enough
to seem odd.  A few seconds later, she finally replied, her voice
sounding at once restrained and bold, different from any tone she had
taken before.
<br><br>
"Rushuna...might I ask you some personal questions?"
<br><br>
"Of course, Your Highness.  Ask anything you want."
<br><br>
"Well...first, I would like to know if you have found the palace to 
your
liking."
<br><br>
Rushuna gave an easy smile at this.  The answer was obvious to her.
"Very much!  Everything's wonderful here."
<br><br>
"That's good...that's good," was the reply, cut short at first, but 
then
continued.  "Also, I would like to know if you have found your assigned
duty to be something that you can...accept."
<br><br>
"More than that, Your Highness!  You're a wonderful person, and it's 
the
least I can do to help you."
<br><br>
"I am glad."  A pause before she asked her next question, pausing often
to make sure she was saying the right words.  "I might share another
anecdote with you, Rushuna, if you would deign to listen."
<br><br>
"Another story, Your Highness?  Of course, I'd love to hear it!"
<br><br>
There was another pause as the Empress collected her thoughts.  "You
see, Rushuna, I have been eyeing someone in the palace for a long time
now.  This person is very admirable, and I know that I must confess my
feelings...but...I am not sure how.  Might you offer me some advice?"
<br><br>
"Oh, I wouldn't know anything about that, your Highness.  I haven't
really thought about it, and it hasn't come up.  I guess the best thing
to do would be just to tell him.  He'd probably be delighted!  It is
you, after all."
<br><br>
With a smile, the Empress bowed slightly.  "I find that advice to be
very good, Rushuna.  Thank you.  However...despite myself, I still
feel nervous.  Perhaps I should think it over for some time before I
do as you recommend."
<br><br>
"That's good too!  You'll have more time to figure out how you want to
say it."
<br><br>
"Again, very good advice.  Now, Rushuna, I had told you of the ultimate
strategy just recently.  I would continue the instruction now, if you
don't mind."
<br><br>
"Of course, Your Highness," she replied, a curious look on her face.
The idea was still rather odd, but then again, she was willing to
listen until she had reached a conclusion one way or another.
<br><br>
With a smile, the Empress continued.  "I thank you, Rushuna.  Now, the
ultimate strategy, aside from a smile, requires being bare."
<br><br>
"Bare, Your Highness?  I'm not sure I understand."
<br><br>
"Being simply as you are, Rushuna.  That is what I mean."
<br><br>
"Oh. I understand now."
<br><br>
"Yes, but there is more.  You should, without hesitation, be able 
to..."
<br><br>
With a motion smooth enough to catch the blonde senshi off-guard, the
Empress quickly enveloped Rushuna in her arms, hugging her gently,
further explaining, "...embrace your enemy, with gentleness...and a
smile."
<br><br>
Looking up at the Empress's face, Rushuna smiled in return, snuggling
further into the warm, welcoming hug.  Time passed in silence, but
Rushuna's mind strove to remember this feeling as something that the
Empress held in high regard.  She had been taught that experience was
the best teacher, and so far, she was learning much.  This kind of
simplicity, without the feeling of fear from having one's life in the
hands of another, a simple yet subtle action that left her unable to
do anything other than relax and understand the Empress's intentions.
Perhaps...the ultimate strategy had more to it than simple pacifism.
<br><br>
"You try now, Rushuna."
<br><br>
Rushuna blinked and looked up. Was it just her, or was there 
some...trembling in the Empress's voice?
<br><br>
"Are you alright, Your Highness?"
<br><br>
"Yes, I'm fine.  Please, I'd like for you to try it."
<br><br>
Shrugging and backing off a little, Rushuna smiled and extended her 
arms
outward, gathering the Empress into her own embrace.  Once her arms
found each other against the Empress's smooth back, they clasped 
together
and pressed the kind noble closer, seeking to emulate the kind of
comfort that she felt so strongly in the Empress's arms.
<br><br>
"Am I doing it right, Your Highness?"
<br><br>
"Very much so, Rushuna.  This is...very nice.  Please just keep doing
this."
<br><br>
Rushuna did as she was asked, doing her best to be warm and comforting.
She had a feeling that the Empress was doing her best to maintain
composure and needed someone's support to keep her spirits up.  At
least this part of learning the ultimate strategy seemed easy.
<br><br>
"Your skin is very soft, Rushuna.  It feels wonderful..."
<br><br>
Rushuna flinched in small recognition.  'Soft, wonderful skin...'
<br><br>
"Rushuna?  Is something the matter?"
<br><br>
The Empress was looking up at Rushuna, an unwilling blush rising to her
face and offsetting the concern etched onto her brow.  Did that mean
that the Empress was fantasizing about <b>her</b>?  That...every single
thrust...every moan...each word of encouragement...
<br><br>
"Rushuna?"
<br><br>
It was then the Rushuna realized that she had not only stopped hugging
the Empress, she had drawn back.  The look in the noble's eyes were
plain to see.  She knew Rushuna knew, now.  In that case, there was
little point in trying to obscure things.  She did just say that
honesty was best, right?
<br><br>
"...I saw you that week ago, Your Highness.  In your bedroom."
<br><br>
The noble's blush mirrored the dismay in her eyes as she silently drew
back as well.  "...You were there?"
<br><br>
"I meant to respond, but I didn't.  I don't know why I didn't, but when
I was about to try again, you had already thought that no one was there
with you."
<br><br>
"...I see..." The Empress put her hand over her heart, her eyes
clouded with consternation.  "...does it disturb you, then?"
<br><br>
Did it?  Rushuna certainly didn't expect this.  She didn't even know
that such feelings were possible.  
<br><br>
"I'm surprised, Your Highness..."
<br><br>
Did she not?
<br><br>
There were those times when she would compare herself to other girls,
or pay just a touch more attention to them...but isn't that a normal
part of growing up?  Just making sure that she was growing up much the
same as anyone else is all.
<br><br>
"...but..."
<br><br>
It's not like it was a bad thing if she was, though.  The world was
wide, and she only knew, at best, a small bit of it.  Besides, if the
Empress said that she had feelings...wouldn't that mean that those
feelings were romantic ones?  It was love.  Was there anything wrong
with such love?
<br><br>
"...that's all.  I don't think it's bad, Your Highness."
<br><br>
"...I thank you for that, Rushuna," the Empress sighed, her shoulders
slumping down as she grew visibly less tense. "It's not entirely 
unheard
of here, but it's not always welcome.  Noble or townsfolk, those who
learned of my...preferences...often grew uncomfortable around me."
<br><br>
"Hmm?  Have you confessed those feelings that many times?"
<br><br>
Rushuna smiled as the Empress let out a tiny giggle.  To the blonde
senshi, knowing that the Empress felt comfortable enough to laugh again
was reassuring.
<br><br>
"Not always, no."
<br><br>
"So you have confessed your feelings to different people?"
<br><br>
"Yes.  Is there something odd in that, Rushuna?"
<br><br>
"Well...I always thought that there was only one person that would be
special to you.  Isn't that how love works?"
<br><br>
"Not always...I have found myself readily able to love many people in
many different ways.  However, I digress.  Most of those who learned of
this did so through observation...though certainly in a far more public
situation than what you witnessed."
<br><br>
"Eh heh heh..." Rushuna chuckled shyly as she scratched her cheek.  "I
understand, Your Highness."
<br><br>
"You always have been understanding, Rushuna.  That's one thing I like
very much about you.  Let us return to enjoying our bath, shall we?"
<br><br>
The blonde senshi readily agreed, and the two sat back and relaxed,
taking in the soothing feel and scent of the bath.  Soon, however, the
silence was broken.
<br><br>
"...Your Highness?"
<br><br>
As the words left her lips, her head whirled with emotions and thoughts
that left her dizzy.
<br><br>
"Yes, Rushuna?" the Empress pressed.
<br><br>
'If I ask it, there's no turning back...'
<br><br>
Things wouldn't be the same anymore.
<br><br>
'Is that a bad thing?'
<br><br>
Was it?
<br><br>
'Is it a good thing?'
<br><br>
Was it?
<br><br>
'There's only one way to know for sure.'
<br><br>
So take that chance.
<br><br>
"...I want to know what it's like."
<br><br>
"What what's like?"
<br><br>
"...Making love with you."
<br><br>
The Empress blinked, momentarily dumbfounded by the request.  Finally,
she spoke, her voice small.
<br><br>
"...Did I hear you right, Rushuna?"
<br><br>
"Yes, you did."
<br><br>
The Empress moved slightly closer, her eyes shining with hope, but also
a hint of trepidation.
<br><br>
"...Is this a dream?"
<br><br>
"No, Your Highness."
<br><br>
"Are you certain?  It does not say less or more about you if you
refuse..."
<br><br>
"Well...since that night, I've been thinking...and now that I know how
you feel...perhaps I wouldn't mind trying it with you."
<br><br>
"Rushuna..."
<br><br>
The girl in question smiled calmly.  "However...it's because it's with
you.  I only want to try this...because it's you."
<br><br>
With that, words were no longer necessary.  The two girls shared their
first kiss, the water sloshing around as they moved closer to each
other.  A bright blush rose to their cheeks as their lips tentatively
parted, gauging the other's reaction.  Both liking what they saw in the
other's eyes, they kissed again, their lips lightly brushing across 
each
other before opening to allow their tongues to begin their graceful
dance.
<br><br>
Rushuna mewled appreciatively at the Empress's technique.  Much like 
her
typical behavior, it was calm and dignified, but also very tender and
loving.  Each gentle stroke and caress sent a thrill through Rushuna's
body, magnified by the feel of the Empress's soft skin against her own.
<br><br>
Truthfully, Rushuna had not thought much of what her "first time" would
be like.  This was probably also somewhat early for it to happen. but
who was splitting hairs?  Granted, this was something that she had 
never
figured on, but now that she was here, it certainly wasn't <b>bad</b>.
<br><br>
In fact...it felt...very good.
<br><br>
The two broke the kiss to catch their breaths, both smiling happily.
<br><br>
"Rushuna, I cannot begin to relate how much I have yearned for this. 
You
are such a kind person, and now...now we are..."
<br><br>
Before Rushuna could reply, she found the Empress leaning in for 
another
kiss, her hand beginning to caress Rushuna's face.  As their lips met,
a moan of surprise escaped her lips as she felt a delicate set of
fingers exploring somewhat lower, tracing the curves of her bosom with
a light, feathery touch.  The whisper-soft feel of the Empress's 
fingers
combined with her inquisitive tongue brought a delighted yelp to
the blonde's lips, both women inspired to go as far as they could with
the situation.  Breathlessly, the Empress kissed her way down, gently
brushing her lips across her partner's neck, then shoulder, slowly
tracing a path to her large breasts.
<br><br>
"I have another confession to make, Rushuna."
<br><br>
After a high moan as the Empress punctuated her statement with a 
teasing
lick at the tops of Rushuna's breasts, the blonde managed, "Yes, Your
Highness?"
<br><br>
"I was genuinely happy when I met you and Setsuna...though it was not
entirely because of your kindness, or the skills you gained in school."
<br><br>
The kind noble's mischievous wink clued Rushuna into the meaning, and
she blushed a little.  "Your Highness!"
<br><br>
A giggle followed by a series of gentle licks was the only answer
Rushuna got, and perhaps the only one she really needed.  Each light
flick across her sensitive nipples sent a small thrill through the
busty blonde's body, and the Empress's insistent and increasingly
passionate caresses were certainly helping with that.  With a light
moan, she shifted up a little to aid the Empress's graceful attempts to
please her, clutching the noble's head to her bosom and smiling as the
loving touches and kisses continued.  Everything was so gentle, and
so...caring.  Every touch, every kiss let Rushuna know that everything
was all right.  With each burst of physical pleasure came reassurance.
<br><br>
'This is right.'
<br><br>
So it is a good thing.
<br><br>
'This is wonderful...and she's going lower...'
<br><br>
Rushuna's waist soon flinched as the Empress tickled her way down her
stomach, giggling at the reaction she was getting.
<br><br>
"Do you like this so far, Rushuna?"
<br><br>
"Y-yes, Your Highness." A high yelp as the Empress dug in a little bit
<i>lower...</i> "It's very good...is this your first time?"
<br><br>
"That's right, Rushuna.  I'm assuming this is yours as well?"
<br><br>
A blush was all the answer the Empress needed, so with a nod, she
continued her teasing assault on Rushuna's hips, slowly working her way
towards the place that she wanted most to touch.  Rushuna could do
little but moan appreciatively under the skilled tongue and array of
delicate fingers that somehow knew how and where to press, to stroke,
to-
<br><br>
"Your Highness, that's-"
<br><br>
"I have dreamed of this often, Rushuna.  I could see every inch of you
in my dreams...and I knew-"
<br><br>
A moan as the Empress slowly licked her way down Rushuna's torso,
nudging the busty blonde further up and exposing her sex to the night
air.
<br><br>
"-that you would react like this, especially if I do <i>this</i>..."
<br><br>
Rushuna was eagerly anticipating the touch that came, feather-light,
over her pelvic region, ever-so-slowly tracing its way to...her legs?
In reply, she gave a little whimper of disappointment.
<br><br>
"Your Highness..."
<br><br>
The Empress giggled at her partner's plight.  "I knew you would react 
in
that fashion as well.  Would you like for me to stop teasing you,
Rushuna?"
<br><br>
"P-please, Your Highness!  You're very good, and..."
<br><br>
"Please relax, Rushuna.  It will be much better soon."
<br><br>
"But-"
<br><br>
"Pay attention as well.  After all, you should be learning my habits 
and
mannerisms, should you not?"
<br><br>
Rushuna's reply was cut off by a series of soft kisses trailed by the
tickling sensation of the Empress's breath, traveling at first down her
toned, shapely thigh, then up...up...yes!
<br><br>
With her delicate hands caressing Rushuna's thighs, the Empress busied
her tongue and lips with Rushuna's wet and eager pussy, lavishing it
with tender licks and kisses.  Each delicate brush with her sensitive
flesh left Rushuna shivering with pleasure, though she did as she was
instructed and tried to keep her focus on what was being done to her...
every <i>inch</i> of her...
<br><br>
'She's being very light...oooh...I can barely feel, but then-!'
<br><br>
A firmer lick from the Empress's tongue sent her mind whirling before 
she
could focus once more on the graceful dance playing across her skin.
Fingers waltzed here and there, dipping in slightly, as their companion
savored the desire rising from Rushuna's core.  The blonde senshi's
body thrashed and arched in a lusty frenzy, her mouth remembering and
whispering much of the same encouragement she heard that night, knowing
that, for the Empress, this should be her dreams come to blissful life.
<br><br>
Rushuna felt the fingers thrusting in and out of her now, lips and
tongue executing a methodical assault on her clit.  The almost fierce 
strength behind each thrust and suck surprised both girls, who had 
grown
accustomed to the delicate grace befitting royalty.  Of course, there
was no such place for that here and no difference between noble or
peasant.  Here, there were just two women intent on exploring these
pleasures of the flesh and soul for the first, exhilirating time.
<br><br>
A series of surprised moans rang out as the Empress curled her fingers
slightly for her successive thrusts, bringing her fingers into contact
with a more sensitive spot as her tongue gently beat Rushuna's clit 
back
and forth, kissing it lovingly in between.  It was enough - no, more
than enough - to push the writhing busty blonde over the edge, her hips
jerking in climax with each inarticulate cry she let free.  No drop of
her juices escaped the adroit flicks of the Empress's tongue as she
dug deep, savoring the blonde's exquisite - at least to her - flavor.
Gradually, she slowed her ministrations, allowing Rushuna to regain her
bearings and process what had just happened.
<br><br>
After a few seconds of luxuriating in the afterglow, Rushuna blinked at
the pensive tilt to the Empress's eyes, and the question clearly etched
into her gaze.  After sinking back into the warm water, she finally
collected her thoughts enough to speak.
<br><br>
"That was...amazing, Your Highness!"
<br><br>
Tension evaporated as the two young women embraced in the water, the
Empress caressing Rushuna's cheek gently as they sat.  They stayed like
that for a long time, until the Empress spoke again.
<br><br>
"What are your feelings on this, Rushuna?"
<br><br>
"...I'm still not certain, Your Highness."
<br><br>
"Do you feel an obligation to return my feelings?"
<br><br>
"Not really."
<br><br>
"That is fine, Rushuna.  To be perfectly honest, this night has
surpassed all my expectations.  Even just this one time, this one
experience, is something I will treasure."
<br><br>
"I feel the same way, Your Highness."
<br><br>
The bath continued as normal after that, with one small difference; the
Empress's smile was a touch wider from then on.
<br><br>
<i>"Rushuna, you've come back."
<br><br>
Indeed, she had.  Yajiro was a wonderful person, and she suspected that
there was something starting to grow between them, but...the memories 
of
that night could be neither erased nor discounted.  The person who
caressed her cheek that night...who was doing so now...couldn't 
possibly
have done what it appears she did.  The warmth of her presence was a
balm to Rushuna's skin, her gaze a reassurance to her heart.  No matter
what happened next, she was at peace.
<br><br>
"Yes, I have..."</i><hr>
