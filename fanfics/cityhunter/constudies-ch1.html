<h1>Continuing Studies</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../cityhunter/index.html">City Hunter</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Emi Makaze paced across her small dorm room restlessly, her stretch 
pants clinging to her long legs. She had just finished a practice, and 
should have been resting up, but the dancer was filled with nervous 
energy. She sat down at the side of the bed, and closed her eyes only 
to see that face again, the concerned gaze of Kaori Makimura.

&quot;Why can&#39;t I get her out of my mind?&quot; Emi whimpered.

Laying down on her back with a little sigh of defeat Emi deliberately 
let herself call up that very first meeting in her mind&#39;s eye, 
remembering standing there and watching with a certain amount of 
amusement as Kaori looked adoringly up at one of Emi&#39;s own photos. It 
was the one of Emi in a white suit, a image that she knew made 
feminine hearts beat faster.

Kaori was a boyish looking woman herself with brown hair falling into 
her eyes, and she had seen through Emi&#39;s feeble attempt at a disguise 
almost instantly. Not that a baseball cap and a pair of sunglasses was 
all that good of a disguise anyway.

Emi frowned slightly as she remembered Ryo Saeba&#39;s boorish behavior 
towards her, then she had to smile thinking of how effectively Kaori 
had dealt with it. Then with a simple dignity Kaori had promised her 
their help.

Again and again over the next few days Ryo had tried to take liberties 
with her, and each time Kaori had put him his place, quite forcefully 
when she felt it was necessary. Emi just couldn&#39;t seem to understand 
how someone like Kaori could tolerate him as a partner, but she had to 
say that he was good at what he did.

&quot;Maybe she loves him,&quot; Emi murmured, then shuddered at the very 
thought.

Almost as soon as Emi saw her, she knew that she wanted to be Kaori&#39;s 
friend. A faint blush appeared on her cheeks as she admitted to 
herself that maybe she was interested in being more than a friend to 
the other woman.

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe I did that,&quot; Emi said to herself.

Emi had been using the shower to rinse before taking her evening bath, 
with Kaori loyally sitting outside the shower stall to watch over her 
when she had been struck by the dangerous impulse. Sounding as casual 
as she could manage to, Emi called out to her, &quot;This bath isn&#39;t too 
large, but do you want to join me?&quot;

&#39;She didn&#39;t run away screaming,&#39; Emi thought to herself sadly, &#39;but 
she certainly left in a hurry.&#39; A smile appeared, &#39;But she sure turned 
up fast once Ryo snuck inside!&#39; It had been a very satisfying 
experience to see Kaori hammer Ryo right out the upper story window 
and down into the hopefully mucky river!

Again and again Kaori would rush to Emi&#39;s side and protect her, 
especially once they were on the train together. The train...

Another blush colored Emi&#39;s cheeks as she though about how Kaori had 
looked them. Black suit jacket and pants, a dark T-shirt, she had 
looked striking. &#39;Handsome,&#39; Emi had to admit to herself, &#39;she really 
was handsome.&#39;

Emi thought of the panic and terror she had felt when they learned 
about the bomb that was hidden beneath the train and how Kaori had so 
easily calmed her down. Those strong hands holding her by the 
shoulders had felt so good, Kaori&#39;s dark eyes meeting hers, and the 
utter sincerity in her voice when she said that Ryo would save them.

After Kaori had traded places with her in the bomb wired driver&#39;s 
seat, both she and Ryo had wanted Emi to get off the train, to get to 
safety. But she just couldn&#39;t do it, couldn&#39;t leave Kaori there, 
alone, facing danger that was meant for her.

&quot;I told Ryo that I wanted to see it through to the end,&quot; Emi sighed, 
&quot;but I really just wanted to stay there with Kaori.&quot;

Ryo had defeated her brother Takaeki Muto, the Professor, and even 
figure out how to disarm the bomb. &#39;By looking at my panties,&#39; Emi 
thought with a fierce scowl, feeling glad that Kaori had punished him 
for that, too.

She and Kaori had shared a blanket at the Shinjuku victory party, but 
Emi&#39;s duties as a celeberty had pulled her away from her place at 
Kaori&#39;s side. She lost her in the crowded block party, and she hadn&#39;t 
seen Kaori since.

Emi sat up, looking over at the bedside phone. She reached for it, 
hesitated, then lowered her hand, thumping it down on to the 
bedspread. &#39;I probably scared her away,&#39; she thought, &#39;I bet that 
Kaori doesn&#39;t even want to see me.&#39;

It had all happened in the middle of a crisis, and even Emi knew that 
strong bonds could form there, bonds that didn&#39;t always last once the 
crisis had ended. &#39;Yes, she took care of me, but that was her job as 
my bodyguard. It doesn&#39;t have to mean anything more,&#39; she thought 
sadly. She sighed softly, &#39;But it does to me.&#39;

The phone rang, the shrill beep piercing the silence.

Emi leapt for the phone, bringing it to her ear as she said, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Emi?&quot; the warm voice that she so wanted to hear say, &quot;This is Kaori 
Makimura.&quot;

&quot;Kaori,&quot; Emi smiled, relaxing for the first time that day, &quot;I was just 
thinking about you...&quot;

Author&#39;s Note: This mini-fic is a continuation of City Hunter: the 
motion picture. When I saw the movie I was mildly surprised at the 
interactions between Emi and Kaori, and wondered if there might be a 
romance there. I&#39;ve done a bit of reading since then, including a bit 
about the adoration some female drag stars can acquire in Japan, but I 
still think that Emi and Kaori might make a good couple. Let me know 
what you think!
