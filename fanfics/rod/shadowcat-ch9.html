<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 9 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rod/index.html">Read or Die</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rod/shadowcat-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        &quot;Kitty-san,&quot; Yomiko looked up from her book for a moment, the 
black hair flowing down her back, &quot;stop pacing.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Kitty flopped down onto the couch beside Yomiko, 
pushing her short brown hair back. &quot;I just hate waiting,&quot; she added.

        &quot;Perfectly understandable,&quot; Joker noted, the tall blonde haired 
man striding into the waiting room. He looked elegant in his suit, a 
slight smile on his face. Before Kitty could ask he held up a hand, &quot;No 
results yet.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry we didn&#39;t wait for backup,&quot; Kitty quietly admitted, 
&quot;we might have captured him before he burned himself.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Joker shrugged slightly, &quot;maybe not. I talked to Mr. 
Anderson,&quot; he said, &quot;he was quite impressed with you skills.&quot;

        &quot;Held my own, anyway,&quot; Kitty said with a frown.

        &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Yomiko asked quietly.

        &quot;It was almost... too easy,&quot; Kitty said thoughtfully. &quot;If that 
was &#39;Ogun he was good, but not as dangerous as I remember.&quot;

        &quot;Tea?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice called out as the door opened again, a 
blonde haired young lady holding a tray in her hands.

        &quot;Thank you, Wendy,&quot; Joker cleared some books from the coffee 
table.

        Wendy set out the tray, moving the snacks to one side, the 
coffee pot, cream and sugar. &quot;Mr. Gentleman has been looking into 
&#39;Ogun,&quot; she said as she worked, &quot;but nothing yet.&quot;

        &quot;Most unusual,&quot; Joker took a sip of his tea, smiling as he found 
it just the way he liked it, &quot;if Mr. Gentleman is having difficulty, it 
must be quite the puzzle.&quot;

        Kitty yawned suddenly, and Yomiko looked over at her in alarm. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kitty-san,&quot; she said, &quot;it&#39;s been a long day for you....&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Kitty bent forward to make herself some tea, &quot;I 
just need some fuel, I guess.&quot; She stacked some treats on a little plate 
and sat back, munching on the cookies.

        The door to the room thumped open, startling Wendy, and the 
burly Drake Anderson strode in. &quot;What is this, a tea party?&quot; he asked.

        &quot;More like a group refueling session,&quot; Yomiko smiled at Kitty 
fondly.

        &quot;No news on identifying the body,&quot; Drake said as he filched some 
cookies, &quot;but they have confirmed there&#39;s no trace of artificial 
accelerants in the remains.&quot;

        Joker frowned, &quot;Not a pleasant thought.&quot; He looked up to where 
Drake stood, &quot;Were there enough organic remains to test for DNA?&quot;

        &quot;Bone shards, there might be some marrow remaining,&quot; Drake 
shrugged, &quot;but I think the tech boys are whistling in the dark.&quot;

        &quot;At least we know that he burst into flames under his own 
power,&quot; Kitty mused.

        &quot;Maybe not,&quot; Yomiko spoke up, &quot;we have run into pyrokinetics 
before.&quot;

        Drake nodded in confirmation, &quot;That was not fun.&quot;

        &quot;Lovely,&quot; Kitty sighed, her words cut off by another yawn.

        &quot;Time to go,&quot; Yomiko said firmly, getting to her feet and 
tugging Kitty up gently. &quot;Kitty can use my couch again tonight,&quot; she 
said to Joker, &quot;we&#39;ll check in tomorrow morning.&quot;

        &quot;Good enough,&quot; Joker nodded, &quot;we&#39;ll call if anything vital comes 
up.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you sir,&quot; Yomiko beamed. Keeping a firm grip on Kitty&#39;s 
arm she dragged the mildly protesting American through the library 
complex and up to the surface.

        &quot;I&#39;m not that tired,&quot; Kitty complained.

        &quot;You&#39;ve had a long day, Kitty-san,&quot; Yomiko said firmly, flagging 
down a taxi for them, &quot;let someone take care of you, all right?&quot;

        Kitty flashed Yomiko a smile, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

        They drove through traffic, the little taxi navigating through 
Tokyo to Yomiko&#39;s building. Kitty climbed out first, stopping to help 
Yomiko get her suitcase cart out of the tight back seat. They bounced up 
the book lined halls to Yomiko&#39;s rooms, going inside together.

        &quot;I kept the couch clear for you,&quot; Yomiko beamed cheerfully. She 
unloaded more books from her suitcase, the dining table teetering 
slightly under the weight, then headed towards the kitchen. &quot;I wonder if 
Nenene left me something again,&quot; she murmured.

        Kitty sighed softly, her thoughts once again turning to &#39;Ogun 
and Sinister. &#39;What are they doing here?&#39; she wondered, &#39;Is it really 
just because of &#39;Ogun&#39;s search for a body, or is there something greater 
involved?&#39;

        Outside the apartment, several buildings away, a brown haired 
woman stood atop a rooftop. She lowered her binoculars, hair blowing 
into her face as she raised a communication&#39;s device to her lips, &quot;This 
is Amelia. It looks like the Cat and Paper are settling in for the 
night.&quot;

        &quot;Return to base,&quot; the voice commanded, &quot;with your poor night 
vision you won&#39;t be any further use there. We&#39;ll send out another to 
handle the night shift.&quot;

        &quot;Understood,&quot; Amelia disconnected.

        The woman slid the device into a pouch in her vest, lined with 
many such pouches, then slid a simple set of aviator&#39;s goggles over her 
eyes. Amelia tilted her head back, a rustling noise heard as something 
slid from the concealment of her clothes. The great wings stretched out 
on either side of her, then with a single sweep she was in the air.

        &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful city,&quot; Amelia murmured, then shook her head 
firmly. She had other, more important things to think about. She swept 
across the darkening skies, finally descending into a series of modern 
office buildings.

        &quot;Welcome,&quot; the tall catgirl nodded as Amelia touched down beside 
her. She was elegantly beautiful, but oddly dangerous too.

        &quot;Yukio,&quot; Amelia said as they went in the roof entrance and down 
the stairs into an advanced facility. The halls were lined with conduits 
carrying power and chemicals, modules spaced out for security purposes 
all along the way.

        &quot;Have you had any luck tracing them back to their headquarters?&quot; 
Yukio asked softly, her black fur blending her into the shadows.

        &quot;No luck,&quot; Amelia shook her head grimly, &quot;the two of them are 
far too good at using evasion tactics to protect themselves.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to facing Pryde in battle,&quot; Yukio said, &quot;my 
template failed against her, but my enhancements will allow me to win.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t get too full of yourself,&quot; Amelia cautioned as they stood 
at the doorway to the master&#39;s chambers, &quot;Pryde and her allies are 
dangerous.&quot;

        &quot;So am I,&quot; Yukio smiled, stalking away with her black tail 
swishing.

        The door slid open soundlessly and Amelia entered, taking in the 
figures around her. The samurai nodded to her, electricity arching, and 
she smiled, &quot;Gennai.&quot;

        Gennai Hiraga smiled slightly, &quot;The Master is tinkering with 
Fabre, I believe, but he should be done soon.&quot;

        Around them chemical filled tubes lined the walls, within them 
the incomplete forms of humanoid beings. Clones of some of the greatest 
historical beings, each one augmented and empowered in their own special 
way. Amelia frowned as she noticed a damaged body, the dark purple hair 
flowing around her face.

        &quot;Is that Mukahari?&quot; Amelia turned back to ask.

        &quot;The Master seems to think there&#39;s potential there,&quot; Gennai 
shrugged.

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; the smooth voice of their master cur across the 
conversation. Mr. Sinister&#39;s bone pale skin was shocking in the near 
dark, his sharpened teeth gleaming dangerously. Behind him another 
person followed, wearing a stylized red demon mask.

        She pulled off the red mask, her brown eyes flashing, the 
replica of Kitty Pryde looking furious. &quot;How dare you place me in this 
shell?&quot; she growled.

        &quot;There was little choice &#39;Ogun,&quot; Sinister answered, &quot;after you 
so foolishly expended the last form I gave you.&quot;

        If looks could kill, Sinister would have died then, &#39;Ogun 
fighting for self control. &quot;How soon will the next body be ready?&quot; she 
demanded.

        &quot;Soon,&quot; Mr. Sinister said softly.</pre>
