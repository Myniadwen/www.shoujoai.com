The Librarian arrives

The campus was crowded in the morning, students moving over to their 
first classes, while mixed among them a few of the teachers, running 
behind and rushing to make it to their classes. But all of that was as 
usual. There was a rustle, students looking in surprise as the man 
skillfully navigated his was through the crowds, nose firmly buried in a 
book. Longish brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail, his clothes semi 
formal in dress shirt and pants. A bit overweight he still looked 
reasonably fit as he smoothly navigated onward. A woman stepped in front 
of him, so he dodged left. She echoed the move, and he tried to dodge 
right, but in vain.

Reluctantly he looked up from his novel, glasses gleaming, and he smiled 
suddenly as he said, &quot;Yomiko.&quot;

&quot;Shane-san,&quot; Yomiko beamed up at him cheerfully, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s the substitute teaching job?&quot; Shane smiled as they fell into 
step, the dark haired woman holding a book in her hands, too.

&quot;Going well,&quot; Yomiko smiled, &quot;how&#39;s the library?&quot;

&quot;It needs some work,&quot; he pushed his glasses up, then Shane smiled 
slightly, &quot;but it&#39;s slowly improving.&quot;

He hesitated, deciding that the crowd&#39;s noise was sufficiently loud to 
quietly ask, &quot;Have you heard from Joker yet?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Yomiko answered softly, &quot;I guess that means we keep looking.&quot;

&quot;Guess so,&quot; Shane agreed. He gave Yomiko a look, a slight smile tugging 
at his lips, &quot;So how&#39;s Nancy been?&quot;

Little circles of red appeared on Yomiko&#39;s face as she said with as much 
dignity as she could muster, &quot;She&#39;s fine, thank you.&quot;

The bell rang, and both bolted as Shane yelled, &quot;See you later, Yomiko!&quot;

Walking along campus Shane smiled, thinking of the events leading them 
here to this remote island campus. Investigating a Dokusensha base in 
Europe he, Yomiko and Nancy had discovered records of rare books, 
possibly several priceless works, spirited away by Dokusensha agents to 
a secret location. However, the records were frustratingly incomplete, 
and a advanced team of agents had been unable to acquire the books.

Joker, after some research, decided a more long range plan might be 
wise. Working with his various contacts he arranged for the librarian 
job at the college to come vacant, as well as a teaching position. Shane 
and Yomiko, it seemed, would fill the jobs while also persuing rumors of 
the lost books, as well as fielding any requests for their special 
skills from the Royal Library.

&#145;Well, here we go,&#146; Shane thought as he reached the multi story 
university library. He smiled slightly as he pushed the doors open, 
walking over to his new desk and setting his carry bag down. He savored 
the scent of books, looking around a moment to take in his new domain. 
The computer banks gleamed as he checked them over, moving on to where 
the book shelves were. He reluctantly accepted the necessity of the 
computers but still, there was nothing like holding a book in your own 
two hands.

&#147;Mr Llewellyn,&#148; the assistant at the check out desk smiled shyly, &#147;I 
unlocked as ordered, and the other staff are shelving last nights 
returns.&#148;

&#147;Thank you, Nodoka,&#148; Shane nodded, seeing the first year blush red.

Walking towards the rear of the library Shane heard a sound, a frown 
appearing on his face. He reached into his pocked, drawing out a piece 
of paper. Between his fingers it stiffened oddly, a razor edge forming 
as he moved forward.

The student sat at a private table, her head bent down over a book, a 
fierce frown on her face. Obviously she wasn&#39;t finding what she was 
looking for. &#147;Damn it,&#148; she scowled, slamming the book she was reading 
roughly closed.

Feeling a bit sheepish Shane slid the paper away before clearing his 
throat and asking, &quot;Good morning, is there anything I can help you 
find?&quot;

The girl frowned, waving around a slip with a Dewey decimal code on it, 
&quot;The programming books are completely messed up.&quot;

&quot;May I?&quot; Shane took the sheet thoughtfully, &quot;Let&#39;s take a look, Miss 
Miles.&quot;

&quot;How did you know my name?&quot; Kelly Miles looked at him in surprise as 
they walked to the appropriate section.

Shane knelt down beside the rows of books as he said absentmindedly, &quot;I 
looked up the users who took the most books out and compared that to 
yearbook photos.&quot; He slid some books forward, reaching behind to search 
the gap between the front and back shelves, &quot;Ah hah!&quot;

Kelly blinked as he put the slightly dusty book in her hands. She looked 
up at him with an curious expression, &quot;You&#39;re not the most normal 
librarian, are you?&quot;

&quot;Suppose not,&quot; Shane shrugged, giving her a wave as he left her to her 
work.

Yomiko&#39;s First Day

Yomiko bolted, her long coat flapping around her as she heard Shane call 
out, &quot;See you later, Yomiko!&quot;

Happily the brown haired teacher bounded through the campus and into the 
hallways of the English department, dragging her usual cart of books 
behind her. The second bell rang, and Yomiko blurted, &quot;I&#39;m going to be 
late!&quot;

With a surprising burst of speed from such a avowed bibliophile she 
barreled down the hall, startling several latecomers and making a 
leather jacket clad woman swear at her softly. &#147;Watch it,&#148; she snarled.

&quot;Sorry!&quot; Yomiko&#39;s voice came from farther down the hall.

Rio looked after her, a clearly irritable look on her face. &quot;First time 
I&#39;ve seen a teacher be that late,&quot; she muttered, wishing she had a smoke 
right about then. She frowned, looking towards where the woman had 
bolted off to as she quietly she asked herself, &quot;Now where have I seen 
her before?&quot;

Meanwhile, in one of the English classes the natives were getting 
restless. Siobhan Ward sighed, her head resting on her desk as the 
copper haired woman complained, &quot;I could be working on something right 
now, not sitting here waiting.&quot; The members of the class seemed oddly 
unconcerned that she was a cyborg, her arm gleaming metallic on the 
table.

&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Dan Wisner shrugged sympathetically as he said, &quot;English 
is one of the required courses to graduate, so we&#39;re stuck with it.&quot;

Suddenly the door to the classroom slammed open and a woman leapt 
inside, &quot;Hello, everyone, sorry I&#39;m..&quot; Wham! She tripped over her long 
coat and crashed face first to the floor.

&quot;I&#39;d give that entrance an eight point five out of ten,&quot; Siobhan said 
dryly, actually looking mildly interested.

Dan got up out of his desk as he worriedly peered at her, &quot;Do you think 
she&#39;s all right?&quot;

With her cheerful grin still intact the woman got to her feet, 
straightening out her crooked classes. She beamed at them, &quot;My name is 
Yomiko, Yomiko Readman, and I&#39;m your new English teacher.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just glad she isn&#39;t the coach,&quot; someone muttered.

&quot;Your first assignment,&quot; Yomiko continued on with a bounce to her step, 
&quot;is to write a book report on your favorite novel. Ten pages, and it 
will be due in a week.&quot;

With that Yomiko took a seat behind her desk, produced a paperback novel 
from her shirt pocket, and began to read. There was a long moment of 
silence as the students sat there and gazed at the intently reading 
teacher, wondering if there were more instructions coming.

&quot;Guess we start now,&quot; Dan said as he got a paperback out of his bag and 
began reading.

&quot;You know,&quot; Siobhan dug around her bag for a book, &quot;I think this is 
going to be an interesting class after all.&quot;

The woman paused in the hallway, looking inside at the intently reading 
woman, then she continued on. &quot;I really need a smoke,&quot; Rio muttered. She 
had remembered where, exactly, she had seen Yomiko&#39;s face before, and it 
meant her job here as a covert operative might have just gotten harder.

The photo had been part of a briefing file on a semi-covert operations 
group originally based out of Britain. The Great British Library Special 
Missions group, silly name, but it&#39;s agents had a reputation for being 
eccentric but effective. And Yomiko Readman was an agent for them, with 
the unlikely codename of The Paper.

&#39;So what do they want here?&#39; Rio thought to herself grimly.</pre>
