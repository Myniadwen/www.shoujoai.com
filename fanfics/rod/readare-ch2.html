<h1>Read or Dare! (part 2 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rod/index.html">Read or Die</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rod/readare-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Wendy Earhart hurried up the hallway of the temporary headquarters of 
the British Library, the papers clutched in her arms as the young blonde 
raced to be on time. &quot;Mr. Joker,&quot; she said as she opened the door, &quot;I 
have the files you requested.&quot;

Joker looked up from his cluttered desk, the blonde haired man looking 
impeccably neat as always in his dapper suit. &quot;Thank you Wendy,&quot; he said 
as he got up, shifting stacks of books aside as he added, &quot;put them 
right here.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Wendy smiled as she put the reports down with a soft thump.

Joker looked over at the pile with a wry look as he asked her, &quot;You had 
a chance to look them over?&quot;

&quot;Skimmed them,&quot; Wendy conceded.

&quot;Can you give me a summary?&quot; Joker asked hopefully.

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Wendy said, quickly looking around the small, book filled 
office. Finding a chair she took the books off the seat then dragged it 
over as she asked, &quot;Do you have any preferences where I start?&quot;

&quot;Dokusensha,&quot; Joker said with a serious look on his face.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Wendy took a notebook from her back pocket and flipped several 
pages before she sat down. &quot;With the death or Mr. Gentleman their 
sponsor Ms. China also died, we believe due to a previously unrevealed 
connection between them. However, even without her they are a formidable 
force, with operations throughout China and the far east.&quot;

&quot;While we&#39;re based in Europe, the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent 
in Japan,&#39; Joker calmly noted.

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Wendy noted. &quot;We believe Dokusensha were involved in the 
attack that killed Mr. Gentleman, possibly in revenge for our defeat of 
them in the Ijin case. They also have established a corps of superhuman 
agents like our own, including their own papermaster.&quot;

&quot;The infamous Sonny Wong,&quot; Joker nodded thoughtfully, &quot;also called the 
Recycler. A killer of the worst sort.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Wendy agreed. She checked her notes, &quot;We believe they&#39;re 
continuing to observe Nenene Sumerigawa, so I&#39;ll continue to urge Yomiko 
and the others to stay out of contact with her.&quot;

&quot;And our new paper master?&quot; Joker asked thoughtfully.

&quot;The Word is training up nicely, according to Drake,&quot; Wendy noted. &quot;He&#39;s 
passably good with rifle and pistol, and he failed unarmed combat. 
However, he&#39;s a prodigy in paper defense, producing barriers superior to 
Yomiko&#39;s, even if his attack skills are less than stellar.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to keep that in mind,&quot; Joker noted. He rubbed his fingers 
together thoughtfully, &quot;And our allies?&quot;

&quot;The American Library has offered whatever support we require,&quot; Wendy 
kept the sarcasm out of her voice, &quot;assuming we join with them as a 
lesser partner.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Joker made a face.

&quot;The Russian Library has been somewhat more helpful,&quot; Wendy added, 
&quot;mostly due to their own run ins with Dokusensha.&quot;

&quot;Dokusensha did do them some damage over the Rasputin papers,&quot; Joker 
recalled.

&quot;And they still owe us for recovering those papers,&quot; Wendy agreed. &quot;I 
think we can use that leverage to get replacements for some of the tomes 
lost in the fire.&quot;

&quot;And our agents are still scouring Jinbo-cho?&quot; Joker mused.

&quot;We&#39;re digging through the world&#39;s major book markets, but especially 
there,&quot; Wendy agreed. &quot;So far, we&#39;ve recovered twenty-eight percent of 
the lost books.&quot;

&quot;A good effort,&quot; Joker acknowledged, not pointing out the large 
remainder they had to go. Besides, he was aware she already knew. &quot;And 
the report on the cloning issue?&quot;

Flipping through her notebook again Wendy found the section she was 
looking for. &quot;A unanimous vote has banned further superhuman cloning 
efforts,&quot; she reported, &quot;at least among Great Britain and the United 
Nations.&quot;

&quot;Wonder how long it&#39;ll take Dokusensha to break that one?&quot; Joker 
wondered.

Wendy hesitated before saying, &quot;They already have, though apparently it 
hasn&#39;t worked out too well for them.&quot;

Joker brightened, &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;They spliced paper master DNA into two women who they programmed as 
agents,&quot; Wendy revealed, &quot;Maggie Mui and Michelle Chan. They proved 
effective so when a third paper master child had difficulties, they 
placed Anita King into the two women&#39;s care.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;The two women developed such a strong bond with Anita that they 
destroyed a Dokusensha instillation getting her back,&quot; Wendy sounded 
smug, &quot;apparently Dokusensha has decided to avoid antagonizing the trio 
at all costs. They&#39;re now operating as the Paper Sisters Defective 
Agency.&quot;

&quot;Oh, good show,&quot; Joker clapped his hands cheerfully, then a oddly 
thoughtful look appeared on his face.

&quot;We&#39;ve been concerned about keeping Nenene Sumerigawa safe...&quot; Joker 
trailed off thoughtfully. A smile teased at his lips, &quot;Is Agent Linho 
still keeping an eye on Sumerigawa?&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Wendy confirmed, faintly surprised by his memory of such a 
odd bit of trivia.

&quot;Have someone check over these Paper Sisters and confirm their story is 
true,&quot; Joker said with a merry twinkle in his eye, &quot;then suggest to 
Agent Linho that he should hire them to look after Ms. Sumerigawa.&quot;

&quot;They aren&#39;t the most stable of people, according to the report,&quot; Wendy 
cautioned.

Joker smirked, &quot;Neither is Yomiko.&quot;

&quot;Sir,&quot; Wendy scolded, even though a smile tugged at her lips.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Joker noted a bit sourly, &quot;it might stop the young lady from 
filing missing persons notifications on Yomiko.&quot;

Wendy giggled, then promptly shut her mouth. &quot;I&#39;m sure it must be 
difficult killing all those reports,&quot; she said sympathetically.

&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Joker gave her a faintly suspicious look, &quot;maybe I&#39;ll pass 
the job on to you.&quot;

Wendy&#39;s eyes widened in horror, &quot;Oh, no sir!&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Joker smiled as he picked up the top report, &quot;we&#39;ll see.&quot; As he 
began reading he asked, &quot;Could you fetch us some tea?&quot;

&quot;Of course sir,&quot; Wendy smiled as she headed off.

To be continued...
