------

She began to fidget uncomfortably with her hands, looking first one way 
and then another in an attempt to avoid the angry eyes in front of her. 
It was a dumb plan, a stupid plan, but she found she couldn&#39;t say no to 
the woman she loved.

And now, she found herself in the small living room, sitting across from 
the irate woman scowling at her. She was being made to feel like an 
intruder, an interloper, and it was finally getting to her.

At last, she met those eyes.

&quot;Look, it wasn&#39;t my idea to come here. I knew this would happen.&quot; she 
said defensively.

Nenene Sumiregawa said nothing in reply as she silently continued to 
glare hatefully at the woman who stole Yomiko Readaman away from her.

&quot;Look, I know what you two once had.&quot; Nancy continued, &quot;I tried to tell 
her this wouldn&#39;t work. Give me the word, and we&#39;ll leave.&quot;

Nenene could feel the waves of hate washing over her for the woman in 
front of her, for the woman who took her sensei, her beloved muse away. 
Yomiko showed up on her doorstep two days ago, saying she and Nancy were 
in trouble and needed a place to hide. She wanted to say no, to slam the 
door in both their faces. She looked into Yomiko&#39;s eyes, full of fear 
and regret, and felt her heart break a second time. She let them both 
in, knowing the whole time she&#39;d regret it.

The sounds of someone humming Beethoven&#39;s Ode to Joy in another room of 
the author&#39;s house could suddenly be heard. Nenene let out a sigh as she 
felt her eyes begin to water up.

&quot;I won&#39;t... I can&#39;t do that, and you know it.&quot; she said bitterly as she 
wiped at her eyes, &quot;If sensei&#39;s in danger, I... Tell me at least what&#39;s 
happening.&quot;

Nancy took a deep breath, &quot;I wish I could, but the less you know, the 
safer you&#39;ll be. You&#39;ve already endangered yourself more than you 
realize by giving us sanctuary, which was another reason I was reluctant 
to come here.&quot;

&quot;Humph, don&#39;t worry about doing me any favors.&quot; Nenene replied. She then 
remembered something Yomiko had mentioned to her in passing. &quot;I 
understand you and sensei got to meet the famed Knight Sabers.&quot; she 
mentioned in a half-hearted attempt at conversation.

Nancy smiled involuntarily. &quot;The Knight Sabers.&quot; she said fondly, &quot;I 
wonder what they&#39;re up to right now.&quot;

------

The five determined women exited via the secret passage in the library 
in the back room, with Michiru in the lead. It was her job to get help, 
and she was trying to remember the directions Priss and Nene had given 
her.

As she and the others were halfway to the door, Haruka stopped. Nene, 
her bow slung over her shoulder and her naginata in her right hand, 
looked back questioningly.

&quot;Officer Ten&#39;ou, what are you waiting for?&quot; she asked, getting the 
other&#39;s attention, &quot;Come on.&quot;

Haruka looked at Nene for a second, then back over to the stairs leading 
to the second floor. &quot;Something doesn&#39;t make sense.&quot; she said.

Priss turned to her, &quot;What do you mean? What doesn&#39;t make sense?&quot; Haruka 
turned to her and gave her an odd look.

&quot;Why would the Chinese want Sylia?&quot; she asked.

Jeena rolled her eyes, &quot;Haven&#39;t you been listening to anything? 
Romastilskin here...&quot;

&quot;Romanova, you dubina (blockhead)!&quot; Nene yelled, slipping into Russian 
in her anger, &quot;It&#39;s Ro-ma-no-va!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she said she saw Linna kidnapped by the Chinese...&quot;

&quot;Right, but only after they caught her snooping around.&quot; Haruka pointed 
out. &quot;So what would the connection be to Sylia?&quot;

The four other women looked at her steadily. &quot;Are... Are you suggesting 
there might be another party involved?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;Oh please, they probably just tortured Linna to get Sylia&#39;s name out of 
her.&quot; Jeena casually said, oblivious to the distress such an idea was 
causing Michiru and Priss. &quot;I mean, come on, she was a geisha. How hard 
would it be to beat the information out of her? You know, a few lashes 
of the whip, a few broken fingers, a few teeth knocked out and...&quot; Jeena 
was cut off as Priss violently grabbed her and slammed her against the 
wall.

&quot;Jeena,&quot; Priss hissed through gritted teeth, &quot;One more word out of you, 
and I&#39;ll personally kill you right here and now! Understand?&quot;

Jeena glared back at her, &quot;You touch me again, and you&#39;ll have to.&quot; she 
answered back in a low, threatening voice.

&quot;Knock it off!&quot; Nene yelled, &quot;This isn&#39;t getting us anywhere. Michiru,&quot; 
she said to Linna&#39;s cousin, &quot;Leave now before it gets too dark. Priss, 
Jeena; lets go with Haruka back upstairs. Maybe we&#39;ll find something we 
missed the first time.&quot;

As Nene and Jeena went upstairs, Michiru turned to leave, when she felt 
a firm hand grab onto her arm. Turning around, she saw a concerned look 
in Haruka&#39;s face.

&quot;Be careful... please.&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t want to loose you.&quot;

Michiru cupped Haruka&#39;s cheek, &quot;I will be. I promise.&quot; she said before 
standing on her tiptoes to kiss her girlfriend on the cheek. As Haruka 
let her go to leave, she turned to see Priss standing there waiting for 
her. A few seconds later, they were both up the stairs and headed for 
the bedroom where Jeena and Nene were already waiting for them.

&quot;Did you move anything around when you got here?&quot; Haruka asked, slipping 
into her role as police officer.

&quot;No, nothing.&quot; Nene answered, &quot;We came in, saw it like this, and went 
down into the pit.&quot;

Haruka noted the ominous blood stain next to some clothes left sprawled 
on the floor. &quot;Malso, give me your candle.&quot; she ordered. Jeena complied, 
and watched as Haruka got down on all fours and began combing the floor 
by the candlelight.

&quot;What are you looking for?&quot; Priss asked out of curiosity.

&quot;I&#39;m not really sure, I... hello, what&#39;s this?&quot; she asked as she held up 
a small piece of paper. &quot;It appears to be a card of some sort. It&#39;s not 
written in Japanese, however. Nene, can you read this?&quot; she asked as she 
passed the card to the pink Knight Saber. The Russian let out a small 
gasp.

&quot;Guys, we&#39;ve got trouble.&quot; she stated, &quot;Haruka was right; there is a 
second party.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Priss demanded. Jeena came over and looked over Nene&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Arsene Lupin, voleur.&quot; she read out loud. &quot;Voleur? What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s French for thief.&quot; Nene answered. &quot;It&#39;s that French thief she and 
the British Library agents were investigating. He&#39;s got her.&quot;

------

&quot;(Lupin?)&quot; the elegantly dressed woman in the room spoke up, &quot;(What&#39;s 
with the tying the girl to a chair routine? That&#39;s not your style.)&quot;

Lupin looked over at her irritated, &quot;(Relax Fujiko, it&#39;s all for effect. 
I&#39;m trying to scare her, to keep her off her guard.)&quot;

&quot;(Well if that&#39;s the effect you&#39;re looking for,)&quot; a third voice joined 
in, &quot;(Why not just tie me to some railroad tracks and be done with it?)&quot;

&quot;(No no, too clich&eacute;d, I...)&quot; Lupin and the others looked over at Sylia, 
a smile teasing the Knight Saber&#39;s face. &quot;Remind me not to underestimate 
you again, Mademoiselle.&quot; he said, switching to English.

&quot;Of course, Monsieur Lupin. And, incidentally, I know a thing or two 
about you as well.&quot;

Lupin smiled with amusement, &quot;Really mademoiselle? Then please, tell me 
about myself.&quot;

&quot;Your name is Monsieur Arsene Lupin, although your also known by your 
nickname, Le Gentleman Cambrioleur (the Gentleman Burglar). You are a 
thief, but you usually steal from gangsters, thugs, and other criminals 
far worse than yourself. You usually send a letter before your 
burglaries, warning your intended victim of what you&#39;re going to steal 
before the act. You also generally leave a calling card behind after the 
act.&quot;

&quot;C&#39;est excellent.&quot; Lupin said with a smile as he scratched a bit at one 
of his sideburns, &quot;Tell me more.&quot;

&quot;Very well; you have a habit of attracting danger like a magnet attracts 
steel, and wherever you show up disaster follows. Also, you have a 
weakness for women, and have been known to put yourself into incredibly 
dangerous situations for a pretty face. On the other hand, you&#39;ve also 
been known to go out of your way to help both children and damsels in 
distress. I seem to remember during my research on you learning about an 
escapade you had at Cagliostro Castle, where you were almost killed 
while trying to help one young lady. All of which leads me to wonder why 
you would&#39;ve wanted to steal those DaVinci papers. Helping others 
manufacture machines to kill innocent people doesn&#39;t seem to be your 
style, nor does kidnapping, actually.&quot;

Lupin got up and casually walked over to Sylia, giving her a chance to 
take in his thin, wiry frame and slicked back hair by the candlelight of 
the room.

&quot;Mademoiselle, that is exactly why my gang and I brought you here; I 
didn&#39;t steal the DaVinci papers, nor did anyone else in my 
organization.&quot;

Sylia raised an eyebrow, &quot;Really? And who did? Genom?&quot;

Lupin leaned in close to the Knight Saber as he dropped his voice, &quot;The 
British Library.&quot; he answered.

Sylia laughed.

&quot;The British Library? Is that the best you can do? I&#39;ve been working 
with two of their agents, remember?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know. Mademoiselles Yomiko Readaman and Nancy Makuhari. We&#39;ve 
been watching them. They&#39;re in danger, mademoiselle.&quot;

Sylia stopped laughing at that.

&quot;Apparently, they were as unsuspecting of the British Library as you 
are. That changed two days ago, when they were observed entering the 
Genom building. They left and went immediately to the British Military 
outpost in the Kioichio Province. From there, they simply disappeared. 
We think they may have gone into hiding at a friend&#39;s house, an author 
mademoiselle Readaman knows. My own little organization obtained an 
order from the British Library ordering their deaths. Apparently, they 
learned too much.&quot;

Sylia studied the man&#39;s face, particularly his eyes. &quot;You... you&#39;re not 
lying, are you?&quot; she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

&quot;No, mademoiselle. And if we know about her author friend, you can best 
bet the British Library is aware of her as well.&quot;

Sylia swallowed hard at that. The aching in her wrists, which were still 
bound behind her, was forgotten as she thought of the implications of 
what Arsene Lupin had said to her. His two henchmen sat passively 
watching the exchange, neither understanding English. The attractive 
looking woman, on the other hand, had a look of expectancy in her eyes 
as she waited for Sylia&#39;s response.

&quot;What... What do you want of me?&quot; Sylia finally asked. Lupin once again 
flashed his trademark grin.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot; he answered.

------

The two riders came around the corner, immediately slowing their horses 
down. It was decided that a slow trot would attract less attention than 
a full gallop, and so they would go slowly the rest of the way. The one 
rider looked at the other, remembering the events from earlier at the 
Silky Doll.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Priss began, &quot;I want to apologize for what Jeena said to you 
earlier.&quot;

Haruka smiled. &quot;Think nothing of it. I&#39;ve been called worse.&quot; she 
answered.

Priss looked around at the darkened buildings and the slow but steady 
snowfall, and sighed fretfully.

&quot;We&#39;re not going to be getting much sleep tonight.&quot; she said wearily.

&quot;Good.&quot; Haruka blurted out, immediately regretting it when Priss looked 
over at her.

&quot;What do you mean, &#39;Good?&#39;&quot; she asked.

&quot;Nothing really, I...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that, Ten&#39;ou. What did you mean?&quot;

Haruka sighed as she felt herself blush. &quot;I... I&#39;ve been having dreams.&quot; 
she mumbled.

Priss tilted her head. &quot;What kind of dreams?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Weird dreams. They started shortly after I first met Michiru at the 
Silky Doll.&quot;

&quot;Really? Like what?&quot;

Part of Haruka wished Priss would drop the subject already; it was 
embarrassing. On the other hand, maybe it would make more sense if she 
talked about it out loud. At the very least, it would take Priss&#39; mind 
off the peril Linna was in.

&quot;Well, I can only remember bits and pieces of the dreams, but there&#39;s 
this kingdom on the moon see, and... and there&#39;s a princess with long 
yellow hair. And...&quot; all of a sudden, Haruka&#39;s voice took on a strange 
intensity, &quot;And then a group of monsters come and destroy the moon 
kingdom. I keep having the same dream, each time remembering a bit more 
of it when I wake up, and I don&#39;t understand any of it. What do you make 
of it, Priss? Priss?&quot; Haruka turned to see the Knight Saber lowering her 
head as she urged her steed forward, obviously lost in her own thoughts. 
&quot;Priss...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s all alone.&quot; Priss answered, her voice almost a whisper. &quot;She&#39;s 
better than me with a sword, but if she&#39;s already their prisoner... 
Oh... oh gods...&quot; her voice betrayed the anguish she was in, and Haruka 
rode her horse over to place a comforting hand on her shoulder. &quot;She&#39;s 
so beautiful, so sweet. Did Michiru ever tell you Linna was a geisha? 
She was, you know.&quot;

&quot;Priss, don&#39;t do this...&quot;

&quot;I was her first.&quot; she continued, &quot;Me. She... she told me later she had 
saved herself for someone she truly loved, and...&quot;

Haruka wasn&#39;t sure what do say or do. After having been brought up in a 
loveless and abusive household, she&#39;d learned to hide and repress her 
true feelings from others. And now, here was this woman, more of an 
acquaintance than a friend, who was opening up to her. While the short 
time she&#39;d spent with Michiru had helped a bit to thaw out her cold 
exterior, she was still at a loss as to how to help her. All she could 
do was ride alongside the sad warrior beside her, her hand still resting 
on her shoulder.

All of a sudden, Priss reached up and put her own hand over Haruka&#39;s.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; she said.

Haruka was confused. &quot;For what?&quot; she asked.

&quot;For listening, I guess. And for being there.&quot; She then turned to the 
blond officer, &quot;You&#39;re a good person, Ten&#39;ou. Michiru&#39;s lucky to have 
you.&quot;

Haruka was dumbfounded; it was the kindest thing anyone other than 
Michiru had ever said to her. Priss took her hand off hers and stopped 
her horse.

&quot;The auditorium is a block from here.&quot; she said to the blond officer, 
&quot;We leave the horses here and walk the rest of the way.&quot;

------

&quot;We don&#39;t know who she is, ma&#39;am. She was caught snooping around 
outside. She was unarmed though, so we decided to keep her here pending 
your decision on what to do with her.&quot;

&quot;I see. Thank you. Open the door and leave us.&quot;

Linna looked up as she saw the door open and a woman in a European dress 
enter. The woman looked at her, her hands bound behind her around a 
small pillar in the amphitheater basement, and frowned.

&quot;I know you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying,&quot; Reika Chang began, &quot;But 
I&#39;m sorry if you were treated roughly.&quot;

Linna looked into her captor&#39;s eyes, &quot;You&#39;re Reika Chang, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Reika&#39;s eyes widened a bit, &quot;You understand Chinese?&quot;

Linna nodded her head. Back when she was in the okiya in Kyoto, her 
martial arts instructor had taught her the Mandarin dialect.

&quot;Miss Chang, what&#39;s going on here? Why was I taken here?&quot; she asked, 
hoping to get information out of her captor.

&quot;Before I answer any questions, what is your name?&quot;

&quot;Linna, Linna Yamazaki.&quot;

&quot;Well Miss Yamazaki, have you ever heard of the Knight Sabers?&quot;

&quot;I believe so, why?&quot;

&quot;They, along with members of the yakuza, are responsible for the death 
of my sister and must be made to pay.&quot;

Linna was taken aback. &quot;The Knight Sabers killed your sister? How?&quot;

&quot;Miss Yamazaki, my family, the Changs, have led the Hou Bang (the Tiger 
Corps), better known as the White Tiger, for generations. My sister and 
I both sought out though, I through my music, and she through Buddha. A 
few months ago she, along with several other priests, monks and nuns, 
were murdered behind the temple walls. Both the Knight Sabers and the 
yakuza were involved.&quot;

Linna&#39;s face lost all of its color.

&quot;Chang.&quot; she whispered. &quot;You... You&#39;re Irene Chang&#39;s sister.&quot;

It was then Reika noticed the short length of Linna&#39;s hair.

&quot;Your head was once shaved, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked excitedly, &quot;You were 
there in the temple when it happened, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

Linna silently nodded her head. Reika turned her head, unable to bear 
the gaze of a woman she perceived to have once been a Buddhist nun.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry. You must think I&#39;m a monster, but while this might not 
be the path of the Buddha, it is my path. I will... I must kill them. 
I&#39;ll teach them about the pain they caused me, I will have vengeance! On 
the Knight Sabers and the yakuza alike.&quot;

&quot;But don&#39;t you see, your sister wouldn&#39;t want this. She gave herself to 
Buddha to make up for the sins of your family, and...&quot;

&quot;I know!&quot; she cried, &quot;Don&#39;t you think I know? But... But it hurts so 
much...&quot;

Linna watched as a tear trailed down Reika&#39;s cheek. &quot;And what will you 
do after you kill them?&quot; she asked.

&quot;My grandfather is an old man.&quot; she answered, &quot;And both of my parents 
are passed on, so...&quot;

&quot;So you will become the new head of the White Tiger? What of your 
singing career? What of the opera?&quot;

&quot;What of it? My coming here to sing was phony from the start. And now 
that I know who you are,&quot; she continued, &quot;I give you my solemn word no 
harm will come to you. However, you will remain a prisoner here until we 
leave; we cannot allow you to leave knowing what you know.&quot; she said as 
she turned to leave.

&quot;Reika, wait.&quot; Linna called out.

&quot;I will send someone to tend to you shortly. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; she said as she 
left, locking the door behind her.

------

Clouds of steam rose from the horses&#39; flared nostrils as the two 
galloped down the dark road. As Nene and Jeena rounded the corner, they 
pulled the reigns on their horses as something caught both their eyes. 
Under the Meiji government, freedom of religion was proclaimed, at last 
allowing the countries hidden Christians to practice out in the open. It 
meant freedom for other religions as well, however.

&quot;A synagogue?&quot; Jeena asked in surprise, &quot;Here?&quot;

Nene shrugged her shoulders. &quot;With all the foreigners visiting Japan, I 
guess it was a bit inevitable.&quot; she answered noncommittally. As she rode 
on she looked back to see that Jeena was still looking at the structure. 
She stopped her own horse and waited.

Meanwhile, as Jeena stared at the structure in front of her, a slow 
smile graced her face.

&quot;Baruch atta Hashem (Blessed are you, O Lord).&quot; she whispered in the 
Hebrew of her youth.

&quot;Hey, Malso, are you coming or what?&quot; Nene called over.

&quot;Hold your water, I&#39;m coming damn it.&quot; Jeena called as she quickly rode 
up beside Nene. &quot;Now tell me again why we&#39;re going back to that house 
that was burned down.&quot;

&quot;Because it&#39;s as good a place as any to start looking for her.&quot;

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe it; the great Sylia Stingray, kidnapped by a 
common sneak thief.&quot; she said with a laugh. &quot;I mean, come on, how 
stupid... Oh shit.&quot; She gasped as she first heard, then saw the fleet 
flying high up above them.

------

Michiru was racing back to the Silky Doll. She&#39;d been out for close to 
an hour and a half in the cold weather. Daley Wong was wonderful, 
immediately offering her a hot cup of coffee after he heard her message. 
She declined, of course; she still had two stops left to make.

Nigel was strangely calm as he heard her out, his arms crossed and his 
face expressionless. She almost got the impression he didn&#39;t care, until 
he unexpectedly reached over and wrapped a warm green scarf around her 
neck with a promise that he&#39;d do whatever it took to save her cousin and 
Sylia.

Major McNichol wouldn&#39;t see her at first, apparently afraid she was a 
certain one-armed stalker who apparently had a crush on him. Once he 
finally did show, she found herself trying to fight off his advances 
long enough to ask for help.

Back in the present, Michiru&#39;s eyes were burning from the icy wind 
whipping at them as she galloped along as fast as she dared down the icy 
streets. Her nose was slightly running, and her teeth were beginning to 
chatter. As a particularly cold blast blew into her face, she closed her 
eyes tightly out of reflex.

The room was romantically lit as she looked out the window at the alien 
landscape. A hand gently touched her bare shoulder, sending a slight 
shiver down her spine. Turning, she found herself staring into familiar 
green eyes. Her lover stood there before her in her chamber, her clothes 
in a pile behind her nude form. Looking down ever so briefly, she saw 
that she, too, was naked. Looking back to the handsome blond in front of 
her, she felt her soul mate cup her cheeks in her hands. She could hear 
her blood thumping in her ears, and feel her temperature rise as desire 
and arousal awakened within her.

&quot;Neptune.&quot; her love whispered in a deep, throaty voice, evidencing her 
own yearning, her own need. She felt herself smile back as she drank in 
her lover&#39;s features.

&quot;Uranus.&quot;

At the sound of her own voice, Michiru&#39;s opened her eyes to find herself 
back in the cold, dark streets of late nineteenth century Tokyo. Before 
she had the chance to even try to figure out what just happened, she 
heard an explosion in the distance, followed by a second and a third. 
Starting to panic, she raced down an alley just as a bomb exploded 
nearby. Startled, the horse she was riding reared up, causing her to 
fall off. She fell hard on her side, spraining her right wrist and 
giving herself a charley horse. Looking up, she saw the horse dart back 
out into the main road, only to be blown to bits less than fifty feet 
away from her.

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: Since neither the AD Police OVA or manga gave much 
information about Jeena&#39;s past, I thought it would be fun to give her a 
Jewish background. As you can probably guess, she isn&#39;t exactly a 
practicing Jew.

Also, before anyone complains about the fact that Arsene Lupin would&#39;ve 
been too young to begin his criminal career in 1880 (the original French 
novels have his birth as 1876), keep in mind this is an alternate 
universe. I mean, I&#39;ve got the Knight Sabers running around in samurai 
armor, for crying out loud- don&#39;t start crying foul now! And anyways, 
the first Lupin III story by Monkey Punch appeared in 1967, which is 
still within reason of a slightly older Arsene Lupin being his 
grandfather. Also, since I doubt anyone here (myself included) has read 
any of the original French adventures, I&#39;ve basically made him a hybrid 
between the original Lupin of Maurice LeBlanc and Lupin III of Monkey 
Punch.

And finally, the 11 Rules of the Knight Sabers Jeena Malso mentioned in 
chapter eight comes from the OVA series. They are as follows:

1: Do not divulge any information concerning this organization.

2: Do not act upon a personal grudge.

3: Do not act without the mutual consent of all the members.

4: Do not secede from this organization.

5: Members are personally responsible for any damage done to the 
organization&#39;s equipment unless that damage was unavoidable.

6: Do not divulge any information concerning our clients. (In the 
original OVA, the Knight Sabers were mercenaries)

7: Do not gather information on your own. The task of intelligence 
gathering is to be distributed evenly among all the members.

8: Keep in contact with the other members regularly.

9: The members do not know each other outside this organization.

10: Do not get involved with a man.

11: The penalty for violating any of the ten regulations listed above is 
death.
