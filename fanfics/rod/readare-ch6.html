&quot;Are you fuckin&#39; kidding me?&quot; Revy sat up from where she was lounging in 
her chair, the reddish brown haired woman looking surprised. She wore a 
simple muscle shirt and cut off jeans, looking lithe and deadly with the 
pistols holstered under each arm.

&quot;I&#39;m leaving Roanapur and Thailand,&quot; Balalaika nodded, the tall, blonde 
haired woman standing there dressed in her usual woman&#39;s suit, the ever 
present Soviet officer&#39;s jacket slung over her shoulders. She flashed 
them a smile and added, &quot;And I&#39;d like to invite the Lagoon company to 
come along.&quot;

Dutch looked at her thoughtfully from where he was sitting, the tall 
black man smiling slightly as he said, &quot;I&#39;m listening.&quot;

&quot;As you may have known, in addition to Hotel Moscow my allies and I have 
fun a quite profitable mercenary service,&quot; Balalaika revealed, &quot;and 
recently a most interesting opportunity dropped into our laps.&quot;

Sensing his cue Benny smiled and asked, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Giving him a slight nod Balalaika continued, &quot;On the island chain of the 
Northern Mariana Islands there has been a great deal of strife recently, 
in which several factions fought over governance of the three islands. 
Hotel Moscow, through various intermediaries, was brought in to resolve 
the situation.&quot;

&quot;And you won,&quot; Rock noted, the black haired Japanese man watching with 
interest.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Boris said calmly, the big man leaning up against the wall. 
Working as Balalaika&#39;s lieutenant he was a incredibly dangerous 
individual, as well as smarter than most people might have assumed.

Balalaika looked faintly amused, &quot;However, once we won a certain 
complication appeared.&quot; Pacing back and forth a bit she continued, &quot;It 
seems the rather foolish governor of the islands didn&#39;t have enough 
money in his treasury to pay us.&quot;

Revy snorted with amusement. &quot;Bet he regretted pulling that pretty 
fast,&quot; she took a long drag on her smoke, &quot;what did you do to him?&quot;

Dutch sat forward, a thoughtful look on his face. &quot;Didn&#39;t he resign?&quot; he 
mused, &quot;I think I heard something about it on the news.&quot;

&quot;Very good, Dutch,&quot; Balalaika nodded, &quot;he did. And I am going to be 
replacing him.&quot;

You could have heard a pin drop. Then suddenly Revy sat up, &quot;Are you 
making a fuckin&#39; joke! You, running a podunk little island?&quot;

Balalaika looked amused, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s much more than a little island. It&#39;s 
situated to be available to the United States and the pacific rim, it 
has airports and a stable population... with the right management it 
could be bigger than Roanapur.&quot;

&quot;So why us?&quot; Dutch asked calmly.

Balalaika&#39;s coat swirled around her as she walked over to her desk. &quot;I 
need people around me I can trust, and not just from Hotel Moscow. It 
may be a great opportunity but running the island won&#39;t be easy. The US 
has interests that will NOT be happy I&#39;m taking over, and there are 
other nations that may be looking to muscle in.&quot;

&quot;You bringing a army?&quot; Benny asked, pushing up his glasses.

&quot;I won&#39;t need a army with people like Revy along,&quot; Balalaika nodded 
towards her, &quot;as well as a few other choice allies taken from the city. 
But I won&#39;t lie, it could get very dangerous for a while.&quot;

&quot;Danger isn&#39;t really a problem for us,&quot; Revy noted. She looked over at 
her boss, &quot;Dutch?&quot;

Dutch studied Balalaika a moment, his expression thoughtful. &quot;You&#39;ve 
never steered us too wrong,&quot; he conceded.

Balalaika smiled, &quot;Gee thanks.&quot;

&quot;But this is bigger than the usual jobs,&quot; Dutch mused after a moment. 
&quot;I&#39;m in, but I can&#39;t speak for everyone.&quot;

Benny looked thoughtful as he asked, &quot;Am I going to get better 
electronics gear than I&#39;ve got on the Lagoon?&quot;

&quot;If what I&#39;ve got in mind happens, yes,&quot; Balalaika agreed.

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; Benny nodded. He looked at the man beside him, &quot;Rock?&quot;

Rock straightened his tie as he murmured, &quot;This is going to be a quite a 
challenge, I think. I&#39;d like to see what happens.&quot;

Dutch looked over at the only one who hadn&#39;t said yes or no, &quot;Revy?&quot;

Revy looked at them, then over at Balalaika silently. &quot;Can I talk to you 
in private, sis?&quot; she finally asked.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Boris gave Balalaika a look.

&quot;Go on,&quot; Balalaika nodded, &quot;we should be done in a moment.&quot; After Boris 
and the others filed out she turned to Revy, &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;What the hell is really going on?&quot; Revy asked, looking at her through 
narrowed eyes.

Balalaika looked amused. &quot;I thought I had explained things adequetely,&quot; 
she noted.

&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Revy answered, getting up from her chair and stalking 
towards Balalaika. &quot;You&#39;re too good to have gone to work for them not 
knowing they couldn&#39;t pay... you knew. You wanted the islands, but why?&quot;

A faint smile teased Balalaika&#39;s lips, &quot;Very good, not even Dutch asked 
me that.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s probably thinking about it,&quot; Revy calmly noted. &quot;Well, you goin&#39; 
to tell me what&#39;s going on, Sis?&quot;

Balalaika turned to look out the window, gazing at the city of Roanapur 
with a jaded eye. &quot;Have you heard of the story of Alexander the Great?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t he gay?&quot; Revy blinked.

Balalaika rolled her eyes, &quot;Other than that.&quot;

&quot;He conquored the known world,&quot; Revy strained to recall, &quot;then dropped 
dead.&quot;

&quot;Because he ran out of things to do,&quot; Balalaika agreed as she turned 
back towards Revy. &quot;At this point, I own all or almost all the illegal 
activity in Roanapur, Hotel Moscow is thriving and I&#39;m quickly running 
out of challenges to face.&quot;

&quot;So, you&#39;re taking over an island to stop yourself from being bored?&quot; 
Revy asked. &quot;That&#39;s fucked up.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Balalaika agreed.

A sudden smile teased Revy&#39;s lips, &quot;But that&#39;s a fucked up I can 
understand.&quot;

&quot;So, you&#39;re coming?&quot; Balalaika met her eyes with a surprising amount of 
earnestness.

&quot;Why do you care?&quot; Revy wondered, &quot;I&#39;m just a gun slinger.&quot; She flashed 
a cocky smile, &quot;A GOOD one, maybe, but still...&quot;

Balalaika reached out to gently push a bit of Revy&#39;s hair back from her 
face. &quot;Yes, but you have the potential to be more, too,&quot; she said 
simply.

Revy shied away from her touch, lighting a cigarette. Taking a deep drag 
she took the cigarette out to look at the glowing red end, &quot;All right, 
I&#39;ll give it a try. I get bored, I&#39;m gone.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Balalaika agreed. She took the girl&#39;s arm as she asked, 
&quot;Shall we give the others the good news?&quot;

&quot;What the hell,&quot; Revy agreed as they headed out to talk to the rest of 
the crew.</pre>
