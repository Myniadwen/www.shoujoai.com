<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 5 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rod/index.html">Read or Die</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rod/shadowcat-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Kitty had to admit she was feeling just a bit relieved when 
Nenene had to leave them to go back to work on her writing. Not that 
she disliked the younger girl, but her almost instinctive jealousy 
of Kitty did get a bit tiring. She dropped off the bags of clothes 
at Yomiko&#39;s place, changed into fresh underwear, a shirt, and jeans 
and then the two of them headed over to the library.

        &quot;Nenene really likes you, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; Kitty remarked as 
they walked together.

        Yomiko beamed, her long brown hair flowing around her as the 
light caught on her glasses, &quot;I hope so, I admire sensei a great 
deal.&quot; Behind her she dragged her usual suitcase on a cart, the long 
trenchcoat she wore ruffled by the breeze.

        &quot;Sensei?&quot; Kitty raised an eyebrow, pushing her shorter brown 
hair back, &quot;I would have thought she&#39;d be calling you that, teacher.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Yomiko shook her head, eyes wide, &quot;I&#39;ve learned so 
much from her books!&quot;

        &#39;Maybe,&#39; Kitty thought to herself as they neared the library 
building itself, &#39;but you don&#39;t seem to see how Nenene feels about 
you.&#39; She had watched the woman and the younger girl together, and 
Nenene&#39;s feelings were crystal clear to Kitty. She cared for Yomiko, 
watched out for her, and maybe even was in love with her.

        &quot;Kitty-san?&quot; Yomiko looked over at her curiously, &quot;What are 
you thinking about?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; Kitty smiled wryly.

        The two of them went into the library itself, moving through 
the stacks towards a raised central set of tables. Yomiko looked 
around all starry-eyed at all the books for a moment, but shook 
herself to focus on the task at hand. She took hold of a pen on a 
stand, shifting the stick over in a set of motions to activate a 
concealed elevator.

        As they dropped down into the Tokyo base of the Great 
British Library Special Missions Agency, Kitty took a moment to gaze 
around her in awe. The massive library hidden beneath the public one 
was as large or larger than X- Men&#39;s underground headquarters, 
extending out beneath buildings on either side of the surface 
library. Bookcases stretched off into the distance, some of them 
being moved on lifts and pulleys into different positions. And all 
around them people worked, filing, sorting, and studying the rare 
books.

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Yomiko sighed to herself happily, unconsciously moving 
to follow a bookcase rolling by them. Kitty reached out to grab her 
by the collar, and Yomiko blushed as she came to her 
senses, &quot;Thanks, Kitty-san.&quot;

        &quot;No problem,&quot; Kitty smiled back wryly. She looked over at 
Yomiko curiously and asked, &quot;So why are we here today?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, Wendy called,&quot; Yomiko beamed, &quot;we&#39;re going to get you 
fitted with a new uniform.&quot; She looked around her, then called 
out, &quot;Wendy-san? Wendy?&quot;

        &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late,&quot; the blonde haired young woman came around 
a set of bookcases, nearly running into them. She skidded to a stop, 
Kitty reaching out reflexedly to help steady her. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Wendy 
smiled, pushing her hair out of her face.

        &quot;You all right?&#39; Kitty asked.

        &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Wendy looked a bit frazzled, &quot;Yomiko, Joker 
asked to see you, too.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll go see him right now,&quot; Yomiko trotted off towards a 
stairway, &quot;Wendy, can you help Kitty out with her uniform?&quot;

        &quot;Hai,&quot; Wendy waved as Yomiko left. She turned back to Kitty 
with a slight smile, &quot;I&#39;ll take you over to the technical division, 
Miss Pryde.&quot;

        &quot;Lead the way,&quot; Kitty nodded to the young lady in a woman&#39;s 
suit, &quot;and you can just call me Kitty if you like.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; the little blonde looked a bit nervous as they 
walked along the hallway. Wendy cleared her throat, &quot;Yomiko&#39;s told 
you about Nancy, right?&quot; Kitty nodded, and Wendy continued on, &quot;I 
know that it&#39;s not your fault, but you do bear a startling 
resemblance to her. Please be careful not to take advantage of that.&quot;

        Kitty sighed softly, &quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s all we can ask,&quot; Wendy&#39;s voice was gentle as they 
entered another room. A pile of clothes lay on a table there, all of 
them pure black. She picked up the pile and handed it over to 
Kitty, &quot;The clothes were made with unstable molecules so that they 
will phase like you do, without you having to use your powers 
intentionally on them.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty took the cloth in her hands, then looked 
around. &quot;Is there somewhere private I can change clothes?&quot;

        Wendy walked over and opened up a door in the far wall, 
revealing a small change room. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she smiled.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty stepped inside, shutting the door behind 
her. She stripped off her clothes then pulled on the new ones, 
smoothing the dark material down with a hand. She opened the door, 
giving Wendy a wry smile, &quot;Well, it fits but it&#39;s a bit too fetish 
for me.&quot;

        &quot;Wow,&quot; Wendy gulped.

        Kitty&#39;s new costume could be best described as a black 
leather sheath. The synthetic leather clung to every curve, the 
pants tucked into leather boots. The top was zippered down just to 
the base of her throat, the tightness making clear that she wasn&#39;t 
wearing a bra. The pants, on the other hand, made it clear she was 
wearing panties.

        &quot;Well, at least I can move around,&quot; Kitty stretched out a 
bit. She threw a few high kicks, feeling a bit of relief that the 
pants didn&#39;t just split wide open. &quot;Not bad,&quot; she conceded, &quot;but I 
think I&#39;ll only wear this when out on a mission.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m going to have a little talk with whoever designed it,&quot; 
Wendy promised, a blush to her cheeks as Kitty went back inside to 
change back.

        &quot;Well, it isn&#39;t all that different from some of my old X-Men 
costumes,&quot; Kitty called out from the change-room, &quot;its just a bit... 
tighter.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve being kind,&quot; Wendy remarked. Kitty came out of the 
changeroom back in shirt and pants, carrying the uniform under her 
arm. A slightly impish smile, &quot;I do wonder what the reactions would 
be if you walked through the base in that.&quot;

        Kitty made a face at that, but otherwise didn&#39;t answer. They 
made their way back into the central part of the library, then they 
headed up the stairway Kitty had seen Yomiko take earlier. &quot;We&#39;re 
going to see Joker?&quot; Kitty asked.

        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Wendy agreed. She knocked on the 
door, there was a muffled reply, and they went on in.

        Joker was standing beside Yomiko in front of a desk, behind 
it an old man sitting. Joker smiled slightly, &quot;Mr. Gentleman, I&#39;d 
like you to meet Katherine Pryde.&quot;

        &quot;So this is Miss Pryde,&quot; the man stroked at a long gray 
beard. Mr. Gentleman&#39;s one eye sparkled with intelligence, the other 
hidden behind an eye-patch.

        &quot;Sir,&quot; Kitty nodded slightly, unsure what else to say.

        &quot;The resemblance really is uncanny,&quot; Mr. Gentleman murmured 
softly. He smiled, &quot;I wanted to personally thank you for offering 
your aide to Yomiko.&quot;

        &quot;It was nothing,&quot; Kitty said quietly.

        &quot;Not so,&quot; he corrected her, &quot;I&#39;m aware of the difficulties 
this has caused with your schooling.&quot; Mr. Gentleman took a drink of 
his tea, &quot;I have some influence, even with MIT. You will be allowed 
to return to your classes when we&#39;re done here.&quot;

        Kitty blinked in surprise, even as Yomiko gushed, &quot;Thank 
you, sir!&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve discussed your plan to visit the surviving Nancy 
clone,&quot; Joker said smoothly into the momentary silence, &quot;and Mr. 
Gentleman agrees.&quot;

        &quot;It does seem to be the place to begin,&quot; the old man agreed. 
A slight smile appeared on Mr. Gentleman&#39;s face, &quot;You think like a 
detective, Miss Pryde.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty said, just a bit unnerved by the old man. 
She smiled slightly, &quot;And it&#39;s Kitty.&quot;

        &quot;Kitty,&quot; Mr. Gentleman nodded. He looked over at Joker, &quot;I 
believe this should be a full operation of the Great British Library 
Special Missions Agency, with all agents they require.&quot;

        &quot;It will be done,&quot; Joker agreed.

Author&#39;s Note: Unstable molecules are a Marvel Comics universe 
invention. Clothes that are made from them are able to adapt to the 
superpowers of the wearer, so that if Kitty phases, they also phase 
along with her.
