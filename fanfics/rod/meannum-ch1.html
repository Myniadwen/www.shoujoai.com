<pre>&quot;Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not 
ours to command.&quot;

	Alan Watts


	Maggie awoke suddenly to the sound of the creaking stairs above 
her cupboard under the staircase.  Leaning over, she grabbed at her 
watch sitting upon a stack of three books.

	02:59

	The digital numbers glared at her through the thick, blanketed 
darkness and the tall woman rubbed at her eyes, a little annoyed that 
she was woken up so easily and at such an hour.  For a moment, she 
pondered who could be up this early in the morning, but quickly 
remembered that sensei kept odd hours because of her writing.

	Putting her watch back down on the books, Maggie readjusted 
herself in the tiny space, trying to find another comfortable position 
so that she could get back to sleep.  Magenta eyes closed themselves 
unconsciously as long limbs moved themselves effortlessly through the 
myriad of books.

	When finally, the tall girl managed to get completely readjusted 
and comfortable, her mind had already completely forgotten the reason 
she was roused from sleep in the first place.  Several moments later, 
her breathing had become steady and her body stilled, Maggie felt 
herself drifting back into a peaceful slumber.

	The dark haired girl was almost asleep again when the door to her 
cupboard opened suddenly, spooking her back awake.  She cried out softly 
at the suddenness of the movement.

	&quot;Ah, gomen.&quot;  A soft voice whispered through the dark.

	Magenta eyes blinked rapidly, attempting to recognize the dark 
figure in front of her.

	&quot;Honestly Maggie-chan, I don&#39;t know how you manage to sleep like 
this, don&#39;t you get sore?&quot;  The figure was now crawling her way through 
the books and across the tall girls&#39; legs.

	A blush crept up Maggie&#39;s neck to her face and she realized who 
the voice belonged to.

	&quot;No, Onee-san,&quot; magenta eyes lowered to a book that was currently 
being clutched.  Maggie briefly wondered for a moment when she picked up 
the book during her sleep, but quickly dismissed the thought when she 
became conscious of the fact that Michelle was still crawling towards 
her.

	&quot;Onee.san.&quot;

	Smiling, the blonde haired woman stopped a moment, taking in a 
small breath, &quot;I couldn&#39;t seem to sleep, and thought I would come down 
here to keep you company,&quot; brown eyes frowned slightly, though not at 
all noticed by the taller girl because of the dark, &quot;but it seems there 
isn&#39;t much room down here for both of us.&quot;

	The dark haired girl sensed the drop in the older woman&#39;s voice, 
and began to feel bad for confining herself to such small spaces.  
Maggie began to shift her body and move several books for her 
counterpart, &quot;Its okay Onee-san, you can come in here.&quot;

	&quot;Really?!&quot; Michelle squealed out of delight and leapt forward 
hugging her tall companion.

	Several books were jolted from their resting spots on the shelves, 
falling around the two girls.  Magenta eyes went wide, surprised by the 
sudden physical contact, and watched as her watch went falling to the 
ground along side the other books.

	03:27

	Maggie&#39;s body relaxed under the weight of her sister; she 
unconsciously let go the book she&#39;d been clutching and wrapped her arms 
tightly around Michelle.  The two stayed in that position for several 
moments, enjoying the contact from the other.

	&quot;Ah, oh, gomen Maggie-chan!&quot;  Brown eyes shot open and pulled back 
away from the dark haired woman.  Michelle bowed her head down and spoke 
in a hushed tone, &quot;I woke you up didn&#39;t I?&quot;

	Shaking her head slightly, the tall girl replied, &quot;Eh, oh, it&#39;s 
alright.  I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

	Blonde hair danced in the faint glow from the digital watch and 
Maggie became mesmerized by it.  She watched intently as Michelle fit 
her body practically right on top of the younger woman&#39;s in order to fit 
in the small space.

	Michelle began to speak while making adjustments to sit next to 
Maggie, &quot;You never mind, do you?  Not that I want you to mind.  I like 
the fact that you&#39;re so accommodating to everyone.  Not that you allow 
people to walk all over you, because you don&#39;t at all.  You&#39;re pretty 
intimidating when you want to be.&quot;

	Maggie felt a grin creep onto her face as the blonde haired woman 
babbled on.

	&quot;And the way you handled that dirty paper user, I bet he was 
surprised to find his self an even match in you.&quot;  Michelle had decided 
to sit half on, half off of Maggie&#39;s legs and leaned against the younger 
woman, sighing contentedly.

	The two women settled into a comfortable silence and enjoyed the 
physical contact of being close to one another.  Blonde hair began to 
nod off a bit and Maggie unconsciously rubbed her sisters&#39; arms 
soothingly, helping her get back to sleep.

	&quot;Maggie-chan.&quot;

	Magenta eyes closed softly at the sound of her name, &quot;Yes, 
Onee-san?&quot;

	The older woman picked at a loose thread on the taller girls 
shirt, as she debated silently whether or not to go on.  After several 
moments, the thread looked like it was not going to come out without a 
pair of scissors, and Michelle gave up, resting her hand atop of 
Maggie&#39;s stomach.

	Another blush crept up the tall girl&#39;s neck and face, feeling the 
warmth of the blonde woman&#39;s hand lying on her belly.  Michelle took 
another deep breath, deciding she was going to talk, once and for all.  
Brown eyes peered into the darkness, seeking out magenta eyes.

	&quot;Maggie-chan; you&#39;re not going to leave me, ever. right?&quot;

	The tall girl felt her body freeze at the hesitancy in Michelle&#39;s 
voice.  Maggie was at a loss for words; she&#39;d never heard her onee-sama 
sound so unsure and almost frightened.  Magenta eyes closed, fighting 
back a tear that was threatening to spill.  It hurt her so very much 
that her older sister was feeling such pain.

	Fingers gripped tightly at the tall girl&#39;s shirt, lightly pulling 
at it as Michelle leaned her head against Maggie&#39;s chest.  Taking a deep 
breath, the blonde girl pushed away any thoughts of tears; in fear of 
making Maggie cry.

	And over something this silly.  Michelle didn&#39;t know why she&#39;d 
said it.  But at that moment, she felt so right in the dark haired 
woman&#39;s arms; she didn&#39;t want to lose something so wonderful.  Letting 
go of the shirt, Michelle pinched at her cheek and looked up again into 
the dark, trying to find those magenta eyes that were so magnetizing.

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry Maggie-chan.  I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound like that.  
We&#39;re always going to be together, neh?&quot;

	The tall girl&#39;s eyes widened a little bit.  Onee-san. always so 
cheerful and strong.  Maggie didn&#39;t know what to say.  She just stared 
back at brown eyes, admiring how large and beautiful they were.

	She can&#39;t see me through the darkness, Maggie thought.  As she 
watched the blonde girl&#39;s eyes, they didn&#39;t seem to know where to look.  
Magenta eyes were used to being in the dark; Maggie had no problem 
seeing her older sister.  Closing her eyes, the dark haired girl seemed 
to take on a grimace of frustration for a moment.  After taking a deep 
breath, Maggie reopened her eyes and smiled slightly.

	&quot;I can&#39;t see you that well Maggie-chan, so you&#39;re going to have to 
say whatever&#39;s on y--.. mmph!&quot;  The older woman was silenced as soft 
lips met her own.

	Unconsciously, Michelle closed her eyes, reveling in the feeling 
of those soft lips.  She leaned closer against the taller girl and 
lazily brought an arm up around Maggie&#39;s shoulder.

	Magenta eyes were closed tightly, afraid of her sister&#39;s reaction 
at such a bold step.  She just held her lips against Michelle&#39;s until 
she felt the blonde woman&#39;s arm move around her shoulder.  Taking her 
cue, Maggie pushed a little harder against the older woman&#39;s lips.

	After several moments, the taller girl felt a little dizzy and 
opened her mouth slightly to take a breath, only to get another shock.  
Michelle mistook the dark haired woman&#39;s mouth opening as an invite and 
slipped her tongue into the younger woman&#39;s mouth greedily.

	Maggie tensed a moment, feeling the tongue pushing itself in.  It 
was soft, warm, and strong.  Like onee-sama.  Relaxing a bit, the taller 
girl allowed the other woman&#39;s tongue completely into her mouth and 
pulled at it softly, wrapping her arms even tighter around the blonde 
woman&#39;s curvy body.

	The two women kissed for what seemed like an eternity, as time 
slipped quickly by both.

	It was Michelle who pulled away first, desperately seeking the 
oxygen she didn&#39;t know she was missing.  Maggie grinned, breathing 
heavily as well, and continued to hold the older woman against her.  
Blonde hair spread out across the tall girl&#39;s chest as Michelle rested 
her head upon Maggie&#39;s shoulder.

	The dark haired woman tilted her head slightly and kissed the top 
of the other woman&#39;s head, reveling in the new feelings.

	&quot;I&#39;m glad I came down here Maggie-chan.&quot;

	Still grinning, the taller girl simply nodded in her reply and 
looked towards the floor where a bit of light caught her eye.

	03:48

&quot;Time is a gift, given to you, given to give you the time you need, the 
time you need to have the time of your life.&quot;

	Norton Juster, The Phantom Tollbooth.
