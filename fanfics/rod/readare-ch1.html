<pre>Five Years Ago...

&quot;Ack..&quot; Shane staggered through the headquarters of the British Library, 
the smoke choking the long brown haired man as he raised another wall of 
paper sheets, blocking out the rapidly spreading flames.

&quot;Grab as many books as you can,&quot; Joker called as he limped along, his 
short blonde hair blackened with soot and the leg of his pants charred, 
&quot;but don&#39;t slow down!&quot;

&quot;The doors are jammed,&quot; Wendy yelled at the entrance, the little blonde 
tugging on the handles weakly.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Shane muttered, trying to think faster. He had never used the 
paper like this before, he was just a normal librarian. He hadn&#39;t even 
known that he could do it, not until a falling beam gave him no choice.

THOOM! Suddenly the heavy doors were slammed open from the outside as 
two figures quickly leapt to help the others outside. One woman wore a 
black leather bodysuit and the other had on a long coat and glasses.

&quot;Yomiko, good timing,&quot; Joker managed, then his eyes widened in surprise 
as he got a good look at the other woman, &quot;Nancy...?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s been awhile,&quot; the leather clad Nancy Mukahari nodded as she 
assisted a older gentleman clutching books to his chest.

&quot;Time for reunions later,&quot; Shane yelled, feeling the rising flames on 
the other side of his paper wall, &quot;let&#39;s get going, please!&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Yomiko agreed as she moved over to Shane&#146;s side, giving him a 
sweet smile as she helped reinforce the paper barrier, the Library 
employees streaming by them. &quot;Well done,&quot; she said to him softly.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Shane agreed. The flow of people slowed, then stopped as he 
looked back at Wendy, &quot;Is that everyone?&quot;

&quot;There were fatalities in the original explosion,&quot; Joker spoke up grimly 
as he helped people outside, &quot;including Mr. Gentleman.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Yomiko murmured softly. Her eyes narrowed, clearly angry, 
&quot;They&#39;ll pay for this, whoever they were..&quot;

&quot;Time to go,&quot; Nancy forcefully grabbed Yomiko and Shane, phasing them 
all as they broke and ran away from the burning building.

As they gathered outside Shane took in Yomiko more closely, and saw a 
red stain slowly spreading on her arm. &quot;What happened?&quot; he frowned.

&quot;Someone tried to kill Sumiregawa Nenene,&quot; Nancy moved over to stand 
worriedly at Yomiko&#39;s side, &quot;if we hadn&#39;t been there...&quot;

&quot;When, exactly did this happen?&quot; Joker asked thoughtfully.

&quot;About half an hour ago,&quot; Yomiko winced in pain as Nancy carefully 
pulled her long coat off to tend to the cut in Yomiko&#39;s upper arm.

&quot;Almost the same time the fire started,&quot; Wendy murmured, while Joker 
looked up at the burning building, his expression unreadable.

&quot;Joker,&quot; Yomiko worriedly asked, &quot;where&#39;s Drake-san?&quot;.

It was a few hours later that they had some of the answers, gathering in 
a temporary meeting place in an expensive Tokyo hotel. Most of the 
people in the room were cleaned up, but all of them carried an edginess, 
as if they knew the worse was to come.

Drake Anderson restlessly paced the open area between the couches of the 
meeting room, waiting for word. His daughter had been clipped by an 
explosion, one that occurred almost exactly at the same time as the 
other incidents, and her condition was still critical. The muscular 
blonde scowled, &quot;What&#39;s taking so long?&quot;

Nancy spoke up from where she was braiding Yomiko&#39;s hair, &quot;I&#39;m sure that 
Joker is doing everything he can.&quot;

&quot;Thought you were dead,&quot; Drake gave her a look.

&quot;I got better,&quot; was Nancy&#39;s dry answer.

&quot;Does anyone know why Joker asked me to be here?&quot; Shane asked, his brown 
hair roughly tied back out of his face.

&quot;I&#146;m sure there&#146;s a good reason,&quot; Yomiko gave him a gentle smile.

Just then Wendy opened up the door, the younger woman giving Drake a 
tired smile as she reported, &quot;The medical team Joker brought in have 
successfully pulled her out of danger, she&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

Drake visibly relaxed, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me,&quot; Joker limped inside, leaning on a clearly new wooden 
cane as he said grimly, &quot;when I suspect that I may in part be at fault.&quot; 
There was a moment of stunned silence as he sat down and added, &quot;These 
events were part of a organized attack on the British Library itself and 
specifically this Special Missions group.&quot;

&quot;But why attack Nenene?&quot; Yomiko blurted out.

Joker gave her a wry smile, &quot;She&#39;s the person that you&#39;re closest to, at 
least from what they could tell. Much like Drake and his family.&quot;

&quot;Who are they, exactly?&quot; Shane leaned forward to ask. &quot;You sound like 
you already know who they are.&quot;

&quot;They&#146;re called Dokusensha,&quot; Joker admitted with a weary sigh, &quot;we&#39;ve 
even done business with them in the past.&quot;

&quot;Obviously they&#39;ve decided we&#39;re a problem,&quot; Wendy said tentatively.

&quot;The attack on the library was intended to shut us down,&quot; Joker said 
grimly, &quot;though thanks to Shane that failed, at least in part. I think 
that the personal attacks were to convince our best agents to stay out 
of this.&quot;

&quot;When I get my hands on them!&quot; Drake growled.

&quot;No Mister Anderson, you won&#39;t,&quot; Joker said quietly.

&quot;Why..&quot; Drake blinked in surprise.

&quot;There&#39;s your wife and daughter to consider,&quot; Joker reminded him, &quot;I 
cannot in good conscience allow you to continue on when I can&#39;t 
guarantee their safety.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Drake growled, but he didn&#39;t argue.

&quot;So it&#39;ll just be me and Nancy going after these Literary Mystics?&quot; 
Yomiko asked worriedly.

&quot;We won&#39;t be going after them immediately, in fact we&#39;ll be going 
underground for a while.&quot; Joker smiled grimly, &quot;I want them to think 
we&#39;re dead and gone, ideally.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like the idea of Yomiko and Nancy operating alone,&quot; Drake 
muttered.

&quot;They won&#39;t be operating on their own,&quot; Joker said, giving Shane a 
smile.

&quot;Ah, me?&quot; Shane blinked in surprise, &quot;but I&#39;m just a plain librarian, I 
can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re also a Paper Master,&quot; Joker reminded him. He looked over at 
Drake, &quot;Do you think you could train our Mr. Llewellyn?&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Drake looked over at Shane thoughtfully, &quot;from what Yomiko 
and the others tell me, he&#39;s got some potential.&quot;

Shane pushed his glasses up as he softly admitted, &quot;You&#39;ve got a point.&quot;

&quot;This going underground,&quot; Yomiko said softly, &quot;does that mean I can&#39;t 
see Nenene?&quot;

&quot;For her own safety,&quot; Nancy agreed grimly.

Yomiko reached up to adjust her glasses, her expression grave. &quot;As long 
as it keeps her safe.&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Then lets get started,&quot; Joker said gravely. &quot;Drake, you get to take 
Shane under your wing, I want him weapons ready in a few weeks, ideally. 
Nancy, Yomiko, we&#39;ve got information on additional copies of some of the 
books that were destroyed,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#146;ll need you to go after them.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Yomiko nodded eagerly.</pre>
