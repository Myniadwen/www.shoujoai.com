<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 18 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../rod/index.html">Read or Die</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../rod/shadowcat-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Kitty, Drake and Yomiko left the junction behind as
they cautiously used the map Kitty had downloaded to
make their way downstairs. The tunnels they hurried
through were dark, lit only by low level lighting, and
the walls were lined by an almost unearthly
technology.

&quot;Wonder where the hell he got the technology to do
this?&quot; Drake Anderson mused, the tall blonde man
stopping the others as he checked around a corner.
Satisfied the coast was clear he waved them on,
following with his gun at the ready.

Kitty Pryde walked beside Yomiko, occasionally
reaching out gently to steady the other woman as they
hurried towards the elevators. &quot;According to some
friends of mine Sinister&#39;s been around a pretty long
time,&quot; the brown haired girl revealed, &quot;maybe more
than a hundred years. With that much time building up
exotic technologies wouldn&#39;t be that hard.&quot;

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Yomiko Readman murmured as they finally
reached the elevators, the black haired young woman
hitting the call switch.

Drake kept a wary eye out as the elevator arrived,
doors opening with a soft chime. Gennai Hiraga looked
out at them, the black haired samurai&#39;s eyes widening
as he blurted, &quot;You?&quot;

Kitty didn&#39;t even think about it, lunging forward to
phase herself through him and his electric battery
backpack. There was a flare of light as her abilities
disrupted the device, then a stunned cry as Gennai
convulsed, electricity shorting out his body and
dropping him to the floor, unconscious.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Drake blurted, &quot;I never even had a chance to
shoot!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kitty said, frowning as she realized an
electrical bolt had hit the elevator&#39;s control panel,
&quot;I figured it would be best to hit him before he had a
chance to zap us.&quot; She pressed the down button once or
twice then shook her head, &quot;It&#39;s shorted out, too.&quot;

&quot;We can always try the stairs,&quot; Yomiko sighed.

A few minutes later the three of them were running
down the stairs, all around them the sound of pipes
rattling and the scent of ozone hanging in the air.
&quot;So this Sinister... how can we hurt him?&quot; Drake
asked.

&quot;Directly?&quot; Kitty raised an eyebrow as they turned a
corner and continued on down, &quot;Not very easily. He
used an artificial body the first time the X-men
fought him that could take anything they could dish
out.&quot;

&quot;And my power over paper?&quot; Yomiko asked, pushing up
her glasses when they threatened to slide right off
her nose.

&quot;From things the X-men found out later Sinister had
been spying on them for years... it&#39;s probably how he
built a body to protect himself from their powers,&quot;
Kitty said, &quot;I doubt that he&#39;s had the time to build a
body to defend himself from you.&quot;

&quot;Makes me wish I brought that rocket launcher along
with me,&quot; Drake softly muttered. He smiled slightly as
they reached the bottom, &quot;I guess I get the job of
keeping any of the other Ijin clones off of your
backs?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Kitty agreed.

&quot;Should I...&quot; Yomiko reached for the door handle.

Drake gently reached out to stop her as he said, &quot;No,
let me.&quot; Carefully he opened up the door and scanned
the room just beyond, silently looking inside for a
moment. &quot;You two should see this,&quot; he said softly.

Kitty and Yomiko followed him inside, only to freeze
in surprise. Massive tubes filled with green fluid
bubbled along the walls of the chamber, and each of
those eight foot tall tubes contained a figure
floating inside. Some of them were familiar, others
not, but it was the nearest figure that drew Kitty&#39;s
eyes... because it was her.

The Kitty that floated in the tube looked a little
younger, her brown hair flowing around her face in the
fluid, a breathing tube connected to her mouth. The
nails of her hands gleamed silver, razor sharp claws,
and a faint trace work of white scars across her nude
form indicated that other surgical modifications had
been made.

&quot;Did he build this... thing for &#39;Ogun, maybe?&quot; Kitty
asked softly, reaching out to touch the warm glass.

&quot;Kitty,&quot; Yomiko placed a comforting hand on her
shoulder,

&quot;There&#39;s dozens of chambers,&quot; Drake noted as he
quickly checked around the room, &quot;several Ijin we know
and a couple I don&#39;t recognize.&quot; He hesitated, looking
at one tube not far away, &quot;Yomiko, you wanted to know
if Sinister created Nancy?&quot;

Both Kitty and Yomiko headed over, gazing in surprise
at the figure in awe. &quot;Nancy,&quot; Yomiko breathed out,
looking at the floating form of Nancy Mukahari.

The similarities between her and Kitty outweighed the
few differences, like the black hair and larger bust,
and it was like looking into a distorted mirror. &quot;It&#39;s
eerie,&quot; Kitty blinked.

Drake kept a wary eye out as he asked them, &quot;So what
do you want to do?&quot;

&quot;My first impulse is to trash the place,&quot; Kitty
admitted, &quot;Yomiko?&quot;

Yomiko looked at the copy of the woman she once loved,
and then looked towards Kitty with an oddly searching
look. Whatever she was looking for she seemed to find
in Kitty&#39;s eyes as she turned to Drake and said,
&quot;Destroy it.&quot;

With easy efficiency Drake pulled the explosives from
his backpack and planted them around the chamber and
on the tubes before leading the two women out of the
room. They went up a floor before Drake took out the
remote, &quot;Ready?&quot;

&quot;Do it,&quot; Kitty nodded and Drake pushed the switch.

Ka-THOOM!

The entire building felt like it bucked, plaster
falling from the roof around them as alarms finally
sounded off in the distance. &quot;Drake-san,&quot; Yomiko
managed as Kitty helped hold the off-balance young
woman up, &quot;I think you might have overdone it a bit.&quot;

&quot;I like to be thorough,&quot; Drake shrugged as they headed
back up the stairs. &quot;So are we heading up after
Sinister, &#39;Ogun and the surviving Ijin?&quot; he asked.

&quot;If they were smart they&#39;d have bolted at the first
alarm,&quot; Kitty puffed, &quot;but I&#39;m hoping that destroying
his cloning lab will piss Sinister off enough that
he&#39;s not thinking clearly.&quot;

&quot;You really want to get him, don&#39;t you?&quot; Yomiko asked
as they made it to the main floor.

Kitty flipped open the laptop, scrolling through the
data that she had downloaded earlier in hopes of
finding another elevator, in the process giving
everyone a chance to catch their breaths. &quot;Yes, I do,&quot;
she admitted, &quot;I feel oddly violated, knowing how he
created copies of me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Yomiko murmured, resting a hand on
Kitty&#39;s arm.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kitty smiled at her. She looked up at Drake
as she continued, &quot;There&#39;s another elevator, but it&#39;s
on the other side of this floor.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to climb stairs all the way up,&quot; Drake
said with a tired shrug, &quot;so let&#39;s go try out the
other elevator.&quot;

The main floor was open to the public so it was more
normal looking than the other parts of the building,
but there was still an odd feel to it. &quot;Where are the
security guards?&quot; Yomiko asked, wincing a bit as they
ran by a wailing alarm.

&quot;Considering all of Sinister&#39;s secrets, would you
trust having normal security guards around?&quot; Kitty
asked wryly.

&quot;True,&quot; Yomiko conceded.

&quot;Which means we&#39;ll be facing Ijin guards instead,&quot;
Drake noted. They came around a corner and spotted the
elevators as he added, &quot;You mind if I call the
elevator this time? Maybe this time we can avoid
shorting it out.&quot;

&quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t my fault,&quot; Kitty protested as Yomiko
chuckled softly.

Drake hit the switch and in a few moments the elevator
arrived, the doors sliding open to reveal a figure
standing there. Amelia&#39;s brown hair flowed over her
back as the aviator smiled grimly, her wings folded
back to fit into the small cube.

&quot;I&#39;ll cover you,&quot; Drake brought his gun up, &quot;try to
drop her....&quot;

&quot;Stop,&quot; Amelia held up her hands in the universal
gesture of surrender as she quietly said, &quot;we want to
talk.&quot;

&quot;We?&quot; Yomiko looked around in confusion.

&quot;Yukio,&quot; Kitty looked up instinctively to where the
catgirl clung to the ceiling by her claws.

Gracefully Yukio disengaged, dropping down beside
Amelia then standing casually. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said simply,
&quot;we want to talk.&quot;</pre>
