<h1>Valentine's Gift</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yokohama/index.html">Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Alpha smiled as she awoke, her green hair flowing over the pillow. She 
sat up and stretched, loose pajamas handing on her slim body then 
slipped from the bed, quietly sliding across the still chilled floor. 
Dressing quickly she went into her kitchen, putting on a pot of coffee 
for the morning and any company that might arrive.

Alpha noted the date was February Fourteenth and smiled, remembering 
that it was Valentine&#39;s day. &#39;I should give Sensei chocolate,&#39; she 
thought, &#39;and maybe Ojisan, too.&#39;

The custom of girls giving chocolate to those they liked was an old one, 
and it was a tradition that Alpha embraced, too. Not quite in the 
traditional sense, for while she was giving them to those she loved it 
wasn&#39;t the romantic kind, but still... Her kitchen wasn&#39;t the best 
stocked but she found the ingredients, the cookware and went to work.

Later that morning a fully dressed Alpha got on her little scooter, 
starting up the engine as she settled into her seat. With a beep of her 
horn she was off, bumping down the road as the wind rushed through her 
hair. The scooter was one of her favorite things, providing her with the 
freedom to move across the district and beyond, and helping her connect 
with her friends all over the area.

&quot;Ho, Alpha,&quot; Ojisan waved from where he sat in a rickety chair in front 
of the gas station, the morning&#39;s chill having mostly passed. The short 
older man gave her one of his broad grins as he asked cheerfully, &quot;Fill 
&#39;er up?&quot;

&quot;Not this morning,&quot; Alpha said cheerfully. She swung her leg over and 
dismounted, rummaging in her back pack a moment. Producing a carefully 
wrapped package she presented it cupped in her two hands, &quot;Happy 
Valentine&#39;s day.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Ojisan took the package with a smile, his eyes 
twinkling. With a impish grin he asked, &quot;Does this mean we&#39;re courting?&quot;

Alpha laughed at that, slapping him good naturedly on the shoulder. 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you tonight,&quot; she added, &quot;the usual party is on?&quot;

&quot;Takahiro&#39;s helping organize it,&quot; Ojisan agreed, &quot;with the rest of the 
kids. See you there!&quot;

With a zoom she was off again, Alpha smiling as she rode on. The 
district was a quiet place, off in the country, but what it lacked in 
comforts it gained in the closeness of the people here. She waved as she 
passed people on the road, recognizing acquaintances and customers of 
her cafe eve as she drove, heading for her next stop.

Sensei was standing out by the beach near by her home, the thin older 
woman gazing out at the water, at least until she heard Alpha&#39;s scooter 
coming. Sometimes Alpha thought that if she was going to grow old she&#39;d 
like to be like Sensei.. a fiercely independent, strong, capable woman. 
Alpha made her way down to the sandy shore, standing beside the woman a 
moment as they gazed across the gently splashing water.

&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s day,&quot; Alpha offered the chocolate, enjoying seeing 
Sensei&#39;s mildly surprised smile.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sensei took the pouch in her hands, her eyes crinkling with 
her amusement. She looked just a bit sheepish, &quot;I should have made you 
some, too.&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; Alpha quickly shook her head, &quot;that&#39;s all right.&quot; She paused 
and added with a smile, &quot;If you want, you can give me chocolate in 
March.&quot;

Sensei blinked then laughed, &quot;I&#39;ll do that.&quot;

Alpha fought back another smile, glad she had made the other woman 
laugh. They talked for awhile, chatting, as the breeze stirred their 
hair and the scent of salt was carried inland. It was peaceful here and 
quiet, away from the road and the house nearby.

&quot;I wish I could run out to Yokohama,&quot; Alpha admitted softly, &quot;and give 
Kokone her chocolate, but there&#39;s no way I can get out there and back 
today.&quot; She sighed, &quot;I&#39;d like to send her chocolate, but I guess it&#39;ll 
just have to be a card.&quot;

&quot;You like Kokone a lot,&quot; Sensei said as she looked at Alpha 
thoughtfully, her pendant swinging around her neck.

&quot;She&#39;s my closest friend,&quot; Alpha answered honestly, &quot;she&#39;s very... dear 
to me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Sensei smiled. She turned to look out over the water, wind 
ruffling her hair, &quot;I&#39;m happy you&#39;ll have someone when us old coots are 
gone.&quot;

&quot;Sensei,&quot; Alpha opened her mouth to protest and Sensei shushed her 
gently.

The older woman leaned forward and planted a gentle kiss on Alpha&#39;s 
cheek. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tonight?&quot; Sensei asked as they walked back towards 
the road.

&quot;Yes, after I open the cafe for a bit,&quot; Alpha answered.

&quot;No one would mind if you didn&#39;t open today,&quot; Sensei said gently as they 
stood beside the scooter while Alpha climbed aboard.

&quot;No,&quot; Alpha shook her head, &quot;I want to.&quot; She put her helmet on as she 
said, &quot;See you later!&quot; With a cheerful sound of her horn she was off, 
bumping on the rough track.

The rest of the morning and afternoon was filled with chocolate delivery 
and equally sweet conversation, moments spent with friends as they 
reaffirmed strong connections. Finally Alpha made her way back home, her 
mind slowly turning to consider the things she needed to do that 
afternoon. &#39;First I&#39;ll sweep out the cafe, then make the first pot of 
coffee... I wonder if I should take a photo tonight, too?&#39; she wondered.

Rounding a corner Alpha&#39;s thoughts turned to Kokone, wishing that she 
could send chocolate through the mail to her. However the mail system 
was just too unreliable, the chocolate might be melted or bad by the 
time it reached Kokone. &#39;I need to get up to Yokohama and see her,&#39; she 
thought firmly as she neared home, &#39;it&#39;s been too long.&#39;

A figure stood by Alpha&#39;s cafe, her short pink hair flowing in the 
breeze as she waited by a scooter similar to Alpha&#39;s own. She turned as 
Alpha neared, her blue eyes lighting up as she smiled her greeting, 
&quot;Alpha!&quot;

&quot;Kokone?&quot; Alpha smiled, coming to a stop beside her and quickly getting 
off her scooter. &quot;I was just thinking of you,&quot; she said as she hurried 
over to her side.

Kokone gently took Alpha&#39;s hands in hers, squeezing them gently. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad,&quot; she answered softly, meeting Alpha&#39;s gaze warmly. They seemed to 
be frozen, lost in each other&#39;s eyes for long moments until finally 
looking away.

&quot;Are you here all day?&quot; Alpha asked hopefully.

&quot;I have a few days off from my delivery job,&quot; Kokone squeezed Alpha&#39;s 
hands slightly, &quot;I&#39;m here as long as you want me.&quot; Her eyes widened as 
her cheeks reddened slightly then she hurried to her scooter, &quot;Oh, I 
nearly forgot.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Alpha followed her over curiously.

Kokone drew the package out and offered it in her cupped hands, a shy 
smile on her face as she said, &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s day, Alpha.&quot;

&quot;I have some made for you, too,&quot; a fiercely blushing Alpha confessed as 
she took the beautifully made chocolates, &quot;I was just trying to figure 
out how to get them to you.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll share both bunches,&quot; Kokone said with a blush, taking 
Alpha&#39;s hand as they both walked over to the house.

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Alpha smiled over at Kokone, probably unaware of how 
their gazes lingered on each other like a caress.

Alpha never did open up the Cafe that afternoon, and when she and Kokone 
finally arrived at the party they were what used to be called 
fashionably late. There was a flush to both their cheeks and a glow 
about them, something that their friends all noted but carefully didn&#39;t 
comment on.

&quot;What d&#39;you think?&quot; Ojisan asked softly, taking a drink as they watched 
the young women sitting together.

Sensei looked amused, &quot;They certainly are cute together.&quot;

End.

Notes: For those unaware of the Japanese version of Valentine&#39;s Day, 
girls give homemade chocolate to the boys that they like. On March 
fourteenth it&#39;s White Day, where boys in turn give chocolate back to the 
girls. This is set somewhere in the middle of the YKK manga, more or 
less and if any details are off consider it poetic license, or 
something.</pre>
