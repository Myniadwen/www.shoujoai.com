<h1>The Forgotten Princess</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../escaflowne/index.html">Escaflowne</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: For some reason, maybe the impending U.S. release of the 
movie on dvd, I felt in the mood to write some Escaflowne fic.



I am often forgotten in the story of things. Funny isn&#39;t it? A Princess 
being forgotten. That isn&#39;t something that happens too often, I wager. 
However, I can understand why this occurred. I did not play the largest 
part in the events of the tale and when I did appear I hardly stole the 
spotlight.

No, it was always she who did that, and without trying. She often said 
she was normal where she was from. Just an average girl. I find myself 
doubting that.

Yes, perhaps her manner of dress and speaking was normal where she 
resided but never her. She wasn&#39;t something plain, average that you find 
on the street. Not at all. She glittered and shined as someone special 
could only do.

If she didn&#39;t then he wouldn&#39;t love her so.

There was a joke being told that even reached my ears which said you 
could tell Allen Schezar was a truly great man simply because he had 
gotten all three Princesses of Asturia to fall in love with him without 
really trying. Oddly enough, I find the joke funny on some level simply 
because it&#39;s horrifically true and it cuts to the truth of the matter 
with all the sharpness of Allen&#39;s blade.

We love Allen, yes, that&#39;s true. But he loves Hitomi and I cannot blame 
him. When I look at her, and see that light she holds within her, that 
kindness and the power it lends her, I wish it was my own. In fact, I 
even find myself desiring her as he himself does.

The thought leaves me as quickly as it appears but I cannot help but 
wonder, does my sister feel the same when she looks upon them? She loves 
Dryden and Allen, as he is for me, is just something of a crush, I know 
this to be true but still...

Does she look at them when they are together and she makes him smile so 
bright and true, as if the stars themselves were shining just for them, 
does she long to be a part of that? Does she long to be Allen, smiling 
at Hitomi, rather than the other way round? Or am I simply pushing my 
own wishes and fantasies onto another?

I will never know the truth of things, I am afraid. I am the forgotten 
Princess, the middle sister, whom the fairy tale passes by. I arrive and 
leave like the flight of a feather in the wind, moving the way that fate 
would take me.

I am all of those things and more. Yet, I cannot help wanting for 
something different. Wanting for the tale to start anew, beginning with 
the arrival of the angel from the Mystic Moon simply so I could be the 
one who heralds her appearance. To be the one who meets her first, 
guides her through this strange land of ours, and claims her heart for 
mine own.

Only to have her leave me in the end.

Would it tear me in two? Would it wound me more than it already has? Or 
would the sweet memories of being with her wipe that all away? Because 
at least I would have that, I could keep that within my heart forever, 
and in such a way she would always be with me. Certainly that is better 
than how I am now, longing for things that could never be and acting far 
more foolish than a person in my position should ever act.

I know my role in things. I am the responsible one, the smart sister, 
the one who takes up her duty and will never abandon it. Marlene was the 
beauty, the sought out treasure to be worshipped and loved by men the 
world round. And Millerna is our hope, our innocence, she who would 
soothe and comfort others.

My role is an understated one, leaving me with little attention or time 
to deal with my own wants which seem, even to me, especially to me, 
small in the long run. Asturia is the focus of my wants and cares and 
only she will gain my favor from now on.

And still, I cannot help wanting for more. For the angel to return and 
to at least look upon her once again and bathe in the light of her 
smile, even if she never notices that I am there. Sad, isn&#39;t it? To want 
something that insignificant so much? Wishing for the impossible only 
leads to misery.

&quot;Eries-hime?&quot;

&quot;Seda,&quot; I close the book that I haven&#39;t been reading, merely staring at 
for the half hour while I&#39;ve thought, and smile at my lady in waiting. 
&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;You seem troubled,&quot; Seda begins hesitantly, her green eyes concerned. 
She pushes a lock of hair from her eyes and hovers in front of me. Poor 
thing. Though she&#39;s been with me for five months now she still is 
nervous in my presence. &quot;Could I be of help?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I shake my head and smile. &quot;There isn&#39;t a clear reason why I look 
this way, I am afraid.&quot; Rising to my feet, I walk towards her, clasping 
her shoulder as I pass. &quot;It isn&#39;t something for you to trouble yourself 
over, Seda. I will be fine. I was indulging myself by thinking of some 
passing fancies, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Eries-hime,&quot; she whispers, looking up at me with those big green eyes, 
and for a moment I&#39;m struck by them and I freeze. They&#39;re so bright... 
just as hers were. Filled with a kindness I&#39;ve always longed for. &quot;I... 
I am here for you.&quot; Ducking her head now, Seda turns bright red and 
stammers, &quot;I do not mean to sound bold, I just wish for you to know if 
you should ever need to talk I am here. Certainly I do not expect you--&quot;

I find myself reaching out to her before I can stop it. I shouldn&#39;t do 
such things, I know this to be true, but I cannot help myself. She was 
so much like her a moment ago that I wonder if perhaps my fairy tale is 
just beginning now. And it is not one which will star me and the girl 
from the Mystic Moon, but rather the person in front of me, looking at 
me with teary green eyes full of worry and love.

&quot;Thank you, Seda,&quot; I murmur quietly, cupping her face in my hands.

She tips her head up to me and smiles again. It is beauty and light, 
filling me to my very soul and I do not want to stop myself as my hands 
slide down from her face to clasp her small waist. Pulling her to me, 
enjoying her gasp of surprise and perhaps delight, as she is pressed 
against me, I lower my lips to hers. Her taste is berries, sweet and 
full in my mouth and I find myself wanting more. I hesitantly press 
forward, slipping my tongue into her mouth and when I do, she moans into 
me, kissing me back with a frantic eagerness I would not have expected 
from her.

When we part, she looks flustered but happy, only to have her eyes 
darken with worry and as she opens her lips to speak I know what is 
about to be said. She should not be so concerned, I rarely do anything 
that I regret and when I do, I know I am to blame and no one else.

&quot;I dare say I cannot think of you as only a servant, after that,&quot; I say 
to her with a wry smile and she freezes in her would be speech, her 
mouth hanging open in surprise. I chuckle at her and push her chin up as 
I continue, &quot;Perhaps you would like to be something else as well? A 
future consort to an Asturian Princess?&quot;

&quot;Eries-hime... I...&quot; Seda says slowly, looking at me with disbelief and 
joy. I chuckle again as she soon recovers and flings herself at me for a 
hug.

Kissing the top of her dark locks, breathing in her scent of 
wildflowers, I know this is only the start of my story. I played only 
the smallest of roles in the tale of Escaflowne and the beautiful girl 
from the Mystic Moon but that was the part I was meant to play. Now is 
my time to shine and shine I will with Seda at my side.

Because I suppose it is impossible for a Princess to ever truly be 
forgotten.</pre>
