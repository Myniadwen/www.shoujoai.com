<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 50 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../escaflowne/index.html">Escaflowne</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../escaflowne/locket-ch49.html">Back to Part 49</a><pre>        &quot;It&#39;s too bad that you have to leave here early to go out 
with your parents and Mamoru to have Christmas dinner,&quot; Rei Hino 
leaned over the table to tease her mercilessly, &quot;you&#39;ll miss out on 
all the good food that Sasami&#39;s making everyone.&quot;

        &quot;Whaa!&quot; Usagi broke into tears. Sniffling loudly she 
complained to the others sitting at the table, &quot;Rei, you&#39;re always 
being so mean to me!&quot; Around her Haruka, Michiru and the other 
Senshi all rolled their eyes, quite used to it.

        &quot;Do they always do that?&quot; Anita asked her two new friends 
quietly as they walked by the table. The three little girl&#39;s looked 
remarkably cute, Chibi-Usa in pink and Hotaru in black, while Anita 
was dressed up in a gray suit altered for her by Maggie.

        &quot;Yep,&quot; Chibi-Usa nodded mournfully.

        &quot;They are really cute, though,&quot; Hotaru quietly noted, gently 
holding on to her pink haired girlfriend&#39;s hand. &quot;Too bad Usagi&#39;s 
straight,&quot; she sighed.

        &quot;You don&#39;t think Rei&#39;s still carrying a torch for her?&quot; 
Chibi-Usa asked curiously.

        Hotaru actually smirked when she answered, &quot;Haruka-poppa 
says that Ami&#39;s pretty much put that torch right out.&quot;

        Anita sweatdropped, then her eyes widened. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she 
told the other girls and made her way through the crowd.

        &quot;Anita,&quot; the black haired little girl beamed happily as 
Anita neared.

        &quot;Hisa-chan,&quot; Anita reached out to gently take Hisami&#39;s hand 
in hers, all without really thinking about it. Hisami blushed, but 
the little redhead didn&#39;t seem to notice. &quot;I&#39;m glad that you were 
able to come,&quot; she added.

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; the still fiercely blushing Hisami agreed softly, 
but she didn&#39;t release her firm hold on Anita&#39;s hand.

        Out in front of the Locket a sports car came to a stop in 
the light snow, and a tall black haired young woman got out of the 
passenger&#39;s side. The car then swung around to the back of the 
building and only a few moments later a woman with long orange hair 
came from back there to the front. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Juri grinned at her.

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Setsuna took her arm as the two walked to 
the building itself. There was a surprisingly large lineup, but most 
of the people recognized Juri and cleared the way. &quot;Good evening, 
Bones,&quot; Setsuna nodded to the muscular bouncer.

        Anticipating her boss&#39; question Bones reported with a 
smile, &quot;There&#39;s been no emergencies, no serious trouble yet 
tonight.&quot; She stood guard there in a muscle shirt and black pants, 
seemingly oblivious to the bitter cold.

        &quot;Take a break and grab something to eat later,&quot; Juri 
reminded her as they went in, &quot;one of the others will handle things 
for a bit.&quot;

        &quot;Hai,&quot; Bones drawled with a little smile.

        Hitomi stood at the end of the hallway, cheerfully smiling 
up at the customers as she handed out gifts to the new 
arrivals. &quot;Hi, Juri,&quot; she smiled, &quot;it&#39;s been busy!&quot;

        &quot;I noticed,&quot; Setsuna took in the crowd with a little smile. 
She slipped her coat off, revealing a red dress that hugged her slim 
body from breasts to ankles, her shoulders bare and long gold 
earrings dangling from her ears.

        &quot;No problems?&quot; Juri asked as she slipped her long coat off, 
showing the black woman&#39;s business suit that was beneath it.

        &quot;May&#39;s been handling things pretty well,&quot; Excel popped up 
from behind Hitomi, startling her before collecting their coats and 
then stowing them away.

        &quot;Don&#39;t do that,&quot; Hitomi blurted, clutching her chest. She 
gave Excel an odd look, &quot;And where&#39;s Hyatt, anyway?&quot;

        &quot;Here,&quot; a weak hand waved from the closet behind Excel and 
Hitomi.

        &quot;Waii,&quot; Excel turned and all but jumped in the closet to be 
with Hyatt.

        &quot;Don&#39;t make any closet jokes, Juri,&quot; Setsuna quickly spoke 
up as Juri was about to open her mouth, &quot;not a one.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re no fun,&quot; Juri gave her puppydog eyes to no 
avail. &quot;See you later,&quot; she gave Hitomi as wave as they headed up to 
the bar.

        The bar teemed with people, both adults and the occasional 
kids. Juri had opened the door at Halloween, and some couples with 
children had requested to bring the kids along on Christmas. It 
didn&#39;t effect things too much, though the waitresses were instructed 
to keep an eye on the library. A few kids had gotten an education 
last time, flipping through the racier books.

        Over by the busy bar a tall, brown haired woman wore a 
simple white dress as she casually moved through the mob. She 
chatted with the customers, made the newcomers comfortable and 
generally did a pretty good impersonation of Juri herself. Still her 
eyes lit up with happiness when she saw Juri coming towards her.

        &quot;Juri-sama,&quot; May sighed with relief, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks for opening up for me tonight,&quot; Juri gave May a 
smile as she patted the cyberdoll on the shoulder, &quot;you did a great 
job.&quot;

        &quot;We really appreciate it,&quot; Setsuna added, leaning forward 
while still holding Juri&#39;s arm.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; May blushed faintly.

        &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Keiko came out of the press of people, her long 
brown hair braided down her back. The boy&#39;s suit she wore was pure 
ebony, going well with the white dress that May was wearing. &quot;Are 
you off duty?&quot; Keiko asked May, offering her hand.

        &quot;From my hosting duties, yes,&quot; May agreed,. taking Keiko&#39;s 
hand in hers. She gave Juri a look, &quot;Would you mind?&quot;

        &quot;Have fun,&quot; Juri waved as both women strode towards the 
dance floor together. A soft, romantic Christmas song started, and 
they began to sway together gently.

        Ryouko, Mahoro and Minagi were all standing behind the long 
bar, the three women coordinating together as they passed the beer 
and other drinks around. &quot;Hey Juri,&quot; Minagi poured her a glass of 
colored ginger-ale and produced Setsuna&#39;s favorite drink as she 
nodded towards Mahoro and asked, &quot;can we keep her?&quot;

        &quot;What do you think, Mahoro,&quot; Juri picked up her drink, &quot;you 
want to be relief bartender along with back-up cook?&quot;

        &quot;Sure,&quot; Mahoro slid a can of beer down the bar to Misato 
while she poured a sake for the dark haired stranger who was sitting 
at the bar.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Motoko said calmly. She drank the sake down in 
a single go, gasping softly when she finished.

        &quot;Way to go,&quot; Ryouko cheered, but she didn&#39;t try to slap her 
on the back. There was a dangerous aura around the girl, one she 
didn&#39;t want to mess with.

        &quot;You have the oddest look on your face,&quot; Setsuna said to 
Juri quietly, noticing how her gaze was fixed on the newcomer, &quot;do 
you know her?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Juri agreed as they moved away from the bar, &quot;I met 
Motoko a few years ago.&quot; She sighed softly as she admitted, &quot;She 
beat me in a duel.&quot;

        &quot;An unusual occurrence,&quot; Setsuna&#39;s voice was gently teasing.

        Juri laughed, &quot;Maybe.&quot; She looked back at where Motoko was 
sitting, &quot;I wonder if I could arrange for a rematch..&quot;

        &quot;Juri!&quot; Setsuna scolded her before she realized she was 
joking.

        Tendo Nabiki watched the crowd, smiling to herself slightly 
as she drank a cup of rum and eggnog. Black hair was slicked back, 
and she moved with an athletic kind of grace. Slim hands came up 
from behind her, her eyes were covered and a soft voice said, &quot;Merry 
Christmas, baby.&quot;

        &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Nabiki turned to smile at the gorgeous 
redhead. &quot;I thought you were working tonight, Ayeka?&quot;

        &quot;We finished the demon off early,&quot; Ayeka Kisaragi smiled up 
at her as she relaxed into Nabiki&#39;s comforting arms. &quot;And nobody got 
hurt, too,&quot; she sighed softly.

        Nabiki noticed she looked a bit frayed around the edges. Not 
too bad, but her red dress was a bit messy, her face weary. &quot;You 
look tired,&quot; Nabiki noted softly, &quot;are you driving home?&quot;

        &quot;I was going to,&quot; Ayeka admitted.

        &quot;I don&#39;t live too far from here,&quot; Nabiki admitted to her 
girlfriend softly, &quot;why don&#39;t I take you there after the party?&quot;

        &quot;This is the first time you&#39;ve invited me to your home,&quot; 
Ayeka reached up to gently stroke Nabiki&#39;s cheek, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;

        &quot;Hey, Maggie,&quot; Nenene looked up from where she was sitting 
at one of the corner dining tables, &quot;thanks for getting me a drink.&quot; 
Not far away Michelle was firmly based in the library, reading a 
small stack of paperbacks and munching Christmas cookies.

        &quot;It&#39;s fine, Sensei,&quot; Maggie said in her normally quiet way 
as she sat down in a chair by Nenene. The woman dressed in white 
shirt and black pants was nearly a foot taller than Nenene was, her 
short black hair carefully styled.

        The light caught Nenene&#39;s glasses as she smiled 
slightly. &quot;Do you dance, Maggie?&quot; she asked, sitting back in her 
chair. Her business suit was a bit scruffy, but it seemed to go well 
with the young writer&#39;s personal style.

        &quot;Well, yes,&quot; Maggie blinked.

        &quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Nenene finished off her drink with one 
gulp, getting up from her chair to gently tug Maggie to her feet.

        &quot;But I can&#39;t... Sensei, it wouldn&#39;t be...&quot; Maggie stammered.

        &quot;I don&#39;t have to threaten to smooch you again, do I?&quot; Nenene 
asked her pointedly, puckering up in an exaggerated way.

        &quot;No,&quot; Maggie went beet red.

        &quot;Ah, that&#39;s better,&quot; Nenene murmured, relaxing in Maggie&#39;s 
arms as the taller woman led them across the dance floor.

        &quot;They look cute together, don&#39;t they?&quot; Sasami murmured, 
dancing with Minagi while transformed to her adult form, Tsunami.

        &quot;Not as cute as you,&quot; Minagi pulled her close for a gentle 
kiss.

        Sasami giggled softly before softly scolding, &quot;Stop that.&quot; 
She offered a grin, &quot;Otherwise, I may have to drag you upstairs..&quot;

        &quot;Oh no,&quot; Minagi answered in mock horror, and Sasami chuckled 
again.

        It was getting late as Arisugawa Juri climbed up to stand on 
the bar. &quot;Merry Christmas, everybody!&quot; she cried out, raising her 
glass in a toast.

        &quot;Christmas,&quot; the crowd echoes, raising their cups.

        &quot;It&#39;s been a hell of a year,&quot; Juri said with a grin, feeling 
the eyes of the crowd and her staff resting on her. Especially she 
felt Setsuna&#39;s eyes, warming her deep inside. &quot;And next year will be 
even better,&quot; she said gravely. She grinned, &quot;See you all on New 
Years, everybody!&quot;

        And with that Juri slid back down as the crowd cheered 
happily.
