Haruka was up on the karaoke stage, looking more boyish than she 
usually did as she sang to &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; by Bon Jovi. A screaming 
crowd of young woman were gathered around the stage, but it was 
obvious that she only had eyes for Michiru.

&quot;Ask about my conscience,&quot; Haruka smoothly sang, her eyes meeting 
Michiru&#39;s, &quot;and I&#39;ll offer you my soul,&quot; and she continued.

&quot;Looks like Nabiki&#39;s right again,&quot; Juri sighed to Ryouko softly.

&quot;About business, she usually is,&quot; Ryouko laughed. She looked over at 
Juri and asked, &quot;What was she right about this time?&quot;

&quot;Moving the karaoke stage out here,&quot; Juri sighed, before muttering 
under her breath, &quot;I really hate karaoke.&quot;

&quot;Why is that?&quot; Ryouko frowned.

&quot;Have you ever had the chance to hear Anthy&#39;s singing?&quot; Juri asked 
her. Ryouko shook her head, and Juri smiled grimly as she said, 
&quot;You&#39;re lucky, then. I think that pretty much cured me of karaoke for 
life.&quot;

Juri scanned the crowd, taking in all the regulars who were already 
there, then she noticed a commotion at the entrance. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she 
said over her shoulder before going over to see what it was all about.

&quot;I&#39;m a friend of Juri&#39;s,&quot; the patient voice explained, &quot;and she 
invited me here.&quot;

Bones&#39; distinctive voice, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but...&quot;

Hitomi asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Juri stepped up, smiling apologetically at Aoi. 
&quot;She&#39;s a special case,&quot; Juri said to Bones calmly. The taller woman 
nodded and headed back to watch the door.

&quot;Sorry, Aoi,&quot; Juri smiled at her friend.

Aoi Futaba smiled back, clearly unruffled by all the fuss. A shorter 
young woman stood at her side, looking up at Juri curiously through 
her glasses. Aoi, always the perfect lady, performed the 
introductions, &quot;Juri, I&#39;d like you to meet my girlfriend, Yoriko.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s very nice to meet you,&quot; Yoriko said, a bit nervous as she pushed 
her long straight hair back from her face.

&quot;Same here,&quot; Juri said, gently smiling at the clearly nervous young 
woman. &quot;I&#39;m quite impressed that you could manage to tame her,&quot; Juri 
teased, looking over at Aoi.

&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy,&quot; Yoriko smiled back.

&quot;What&#39;s taking so long?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice complained from the hallway.

Another voice, &quot;Natsumi! Be nice!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Miyuki,&quot; Natsumi answered sheepishly.

&quot;And,&quot; Aoi said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Natsumi and 
Miyuki, fellow officers who help us bust the gaybashers a few weeks 
ago.&quot;

Juri took one look at the two of them and just knew they were a 
couple. The way they stood together practically screamed it to anyone 
looking. Miyuki held on gently to Natsumi&#39;s arm, and the two would 
often exchange a longing glance.

&#39;Just started a relationship,&#39; Juri noted, &#39;and they probably haven&#39;t 
been out of the bedroom for a few days.&#39; Juri smiled at the four of 
them as she said aloud, &quot;Well, I&#39;d like to welcome you all to 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot;

Juri, Aoi and Yoriko walked over to the bar together as Natsumi and 
Miyuki went off to look around on their own. &quot;So how&#39;s your girlfriend 
situation?&quot; Aoi asked Juri quietly.

Yoriko looked a bit startled at the forwardness of the question, so 
Juri explained, &quot;We&#39;ve been friends for a long time, and I kind of 
like having someone to be very direct with me. Even asking the hard 
questions.&quot;

Yoriko nodded thoughtfully, &quot;That makes sense.&quot; She looked over at 
Juri and smiled impishly, &quot;So do you have a girlfriend?&quot;

Juri and Aoi both laughed softly. &quot;Not right now,&quot; Juri said. They 
stood at the bar, receiving quick service from Minagi. &quot;There&#39;s 
someone I&#39;m interested in, though,&quot; Juri admitted.

&quot;So what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Aoi asked. She was a bit surprised to see 
Juri less than confident, having seen Juri&#39;s charms in action herself. 
Usually, if Juri really wanted something, she took steps to get it.

&quot;I think I&#39;m a little out of my league,&quot; Juri admitted. &quot;She&#39;s 
elegant, beautiful, and never seems to be thrown by anything,&quot; and she 
paused a moment. &quot;And she has a daughter.&quot; At Yoriko and Aoi&#39;s 
startled looks, she elaborated, &quot;Adopted, thankfully.&quot;

&quot;So who is she?&quot; Yoriko asked quietly, and Juri discretely pointed 
towards where Setsuna was standing.

Setsuna watched the karaoke performances with a great deal of 
amusement. She drank sparingly, and the crowd seemed to leave a bubble 
of space around her. Her long black hair blew gently, the slight 
greenish tint going well with the red dress she wore.

Aoi saw merely a fairly attractive woman, not the figure that Juri 
described. But she turned to see Juri gazing at Setsuna like a 
love-struck boy, and realized she was looking through the rose colored 
glasses of infatuation.

&quot;I think you&#39;ll manage,&quot; Aoi smiled.

Minagi fought back a smile as she listened. She couldn&#39;t wait to tell 
Sasami and the others about this later. Another woman waved, and 
Minagi scooted down the bar to serve her.

Setsuna noticed them looking at her, and it took a great deal of self 
control not to bolt for cover. &#39;Why does she bother me?&#39; she wondered, 
suddenly feeling rather warm in her dress. &#39;I should never have let 
Michiru talk me into wearing it,&#39; she thought.

Setsuna snuck a glance, noticing that Juri and her friend were still 
talking. Juri had been a perfect gentleman while driving her home on 
Christmas Eve, and even took her to her door. Of course, once it 
opened Haruka and Michiru realized they had forgotten her, and hauled 
Juri in to thank her. Then Hotaru had noticed that the two of them 
were standing under the mistletoe!

To the teasing cries of &quot;Kiss! Kiss!&quot; Juri had met her eyes, then 
slowly bent forwards, giving Setsuna plenty of time to move away. 
Instead, Setsuna had stood her ground, and leaned into the brushing of 
lips.

A flash of fire ran through her even now as Setsuna thought of how 
that kiss felt. She had excused herself as politely as she could and 
quickly retired for the night, leaving a bewildered Juri standing 
there behind her.

Rei Ayanami took the stage, her white dress swirling around her. She 
was stone cold sober as she met Asuka&#39;s eyes in the crowd, singing 
directly for her. Finally, her voice took on a certain emphasis as she 
reached a certain part.

&quot;You are all I long for,&quot; Rei sang to the delight of the crowd, &quot;all I 
worship, and adore. In other words, please be true, in other words, I 
love you!&quot;

Asuka met her at the edge of the stage, &quot;I love you, too.&quot; Then to the 
delighted cheers of the crowd, she kissed her.

Excel bounded over, &quot;Hii! What can I get you?&quot;

Sylia Stingray pushed her silvery hair back, &quot;The dinner special, 
please.&quot;

Excel paused, &quot;And your companion?&quot;

Sylia looked a bit startled, and Mara stepped out of the shadows to 
stand beside her. Mara smiled, &quot;Dinner, too.&quot;

&quot;Be right back!&quot; and Excel was gone.

&quot;May I join you?&quot; Mara asked Sylia with a gentle smile. &quot;I don&#39;t see 
any of the others around tonight,&quot; she noted.

Sylia looked up searchingly at Mara, then she smiled, &quot;I&#39;d love some 
company.&quot;
