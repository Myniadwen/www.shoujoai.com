Tambi Baker and Casey Bullocks were the first to
arrive at the club, the two blonde haired women
arriving at Arisugawa&#39;s Locket early that night. It
wasn&#39;t eagerness that brought them there, thought it
was certain Casey was eager, but instead Tambi&#39;s usual
wariness.

&quot;You know this place has a reputation for the safety
of it&#39;s customers,&quot; Casey said with some amusement as
she and Tambi circled the room, her lover sweeping the
place with her eyes for any kind of trap.

Tambi let her usual set of sunglasses slide down as
the slightly taller woman said, &quot;Maybe, but I am not
taking chances.&quot;

Casey smiled slightly as they wove through the
chattering crowds, &quot;No, I guess not. You wouldn&#39;t be
the woman I fell in love with if you weren&#39;t
concerned.&quot;

Tambi actually blushed a bit, still not used to
hearing Casey say things like that. After a few more
minutes of searching the club she finally felt
satisfied that there weren&#39;t any assassins, kidnappers
and other villains about, and they made their way up
to the bar.

&quot;Hi,&quot; the black haired girl in the maid&#39;s outfit
hurried over to serve them, &quot;my name&#39;s Mahoro, what
can I get you?&quot;

&quot;Beer,&quot; Tambi said with a slight smile.

&quot;Surprise me,&quot; Casey said, eyes twinkling with
amusement.

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Mahoro took off, her long black
ponytail swinging cutely.

Once she delivered their drinks Tambi continued,
&quot;We&#39;ve got a room reserved for a party tonight, who
would I see....?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;d be May,&quot; Mahoro agreed. Flagging down a green
haired young woman she said, &quot;Alpha, can you go
upstairs and get May?&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; Alpha responded, the smaller woman smiling
cheerfully as she hurried off.

A few minutes later a tall, brown haired woman
dressed, yet again, in a variation of a maid&#39;s outfit
came down the stairs to smile at them. &quot;Welcome to
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m the assistant
manager, May.&quot; She waved for them to follow her, &quot;Let
me show you the room we&#39;ve set up for you.&quot;

May quickly led them towards the rear of the
building, where a door opened up into a large back
room with a gleamingly clean table, multiple chairs
and nicely decorated walls, giving it a comfortable
but private feel.

&quot;Oooh, nice,&quot; Casey smiled. She grinned, &quot;We&#39;ll
probably need pitchers of beer before the night is
through, and iced tea for Katchoo....&quot;

May chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ll have waitresses coming in and out
regularly once your guests start arriving, we&#39;ll run a
tab.&quot;

&quot;Good enough,&quot; Tambi nodded thoughtfully, &quot;music?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll pipe some in,&quot; May agreed before adding, &quot;and
we can set up a portable kareoke machine in here too.&quot;

&quot;Kareoke?!&quot; Casey exclaimed happily.

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Tambi sighed softly, already feeling sure
she was going to be pressed into singing later that
night.

Outside the bar two women made their way to the door,
the taller woman chuckling softly. &quot;You remember the
first time you hauled me in here?&quot; Francine Peters
asked, smiling as her dress swirled around her legs.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Katchoo Choovanski smiled, the smaller blonde
dressed in jeans and t-shirt as she commented, &quot;you
were scared spitless.&quot;

&quot;I was sure,&quot; Francine nodded to the redhead doing
bouncer duty by the door, &quot;that one of those scary
lesbians was going to drag me off into a bathroom and
have their way with me.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you stuck so close to me that night?&quot;
Katchoo chuckled softly as she added impishly, &quot;I&#39;m
hurt.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; the blonde haired
door girl dressed in a one piece body suit smiled,
&quot;can I take your coats?&quot;

&quot;No thanks, Excel,&quot; Katchoo answered cheerfully.
&quot;Have Tambi or Casey arrived?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re in the back with another of your guests,&quot;
Excel confirmed.

&quot;Wonder who got here first?&quot; Francine asked a bit
distractedly as they wove their way through the busy
bar.

Katchoo gave Francine a gentle punch in the shoulder
as she said, &quot;Stop worrying about the kids, love.&quot;

Francine blushed a bit, &quot;But what if my parents have
a problem?&quot;

Katchoo reached over to hug Francine comfortingly.
&quot;Your parents raised a fine daughter, and I&#39;m sure
they can cope with two babies for a night....&quot; she
said.

Francine sighed. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; she conceded, &quot;it
just feels odd being away from them for the first
time.&quot;

Katchoo chuckled softly as she noticed the many
admiring glances Francine was getting, all of which
she seemed entirely unaware of. &quot;Your parents love the
kids,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure this gift to us
isn&#39;t a hardship on their parts, either.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Francine smile, feeling a flash of annoyance
at the looks Katchoo was getting, but she was
comforted knowing how strong her commitment to them
was.

&quot;Here we go...&quot; Katchoo opened the door in the back
to laughter and loud conversation.

Margie looked up, her brown hair still boyishly
short, and though a few years had added some lines to
her face she still looked good. &quot;Hey!&quot; she exclaimed,
bouncing up to give both women hugs, &quot;Good to see
you.&quot;

&quot;Been a long time,&quot; Francine chuckled, remembering
Freddie&#39;s old secretary fondly.

&quot;Hell yes,&quot; Margie agreed, &quot;just been catching up
with Casey about the douche-bag.&quot;

&quot;Freddie?&quot; Katchoo laughed.

&quot;Freddie,&quot; Margie agreed.

&quot;I still can not believe you&#39;re the executive
secretary of the firm he works for,&quot; Casey said after
exchanging welcoming hugs with Katchoo and Francine.

&quot;He&#39;s a dirt bag,&quot; Margie agreed, &quot;but he&#39;s a
predictable dirt bag. As long as you keep an eye on
him, you&#39;re okay.&quot;

Out at the bar a slim black haired woman in casual
clothes ordered a drink. Ryouko, the light blue haired
bartender refilled her glass, &quot;You going to join the
others?&quot;

Sara Fitz smiled a little sadly as she took a drink,
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be appropriate.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Ryouko asked as she took a cloth and wiped
down the bar. &quot;I thought you and Katchoo were
friends?&quot;

&quot;Were being the oporitive word,&quot; Sara said as she
took a drink. She sighed, &quot;It&#39;s quite possible Katchoo
doesn&#39;t hold a grudge, but I feel bad for my helping
bust her.&quot;

&quot;You were just doing your job,&quot; Ryouko offered.
&quot;Yeah, true,&quot; Sara agreed as a dignified looking
blonde woman cut through the crowd. &#39;What is it and
blondes tonight?&#39; Sara thought wryly.

Tambi had been reluctantly forced into kareoke, and
to everyone&#39;s surprise she was carrying off the
Griffin Silver tune pretty well. &quot;When I wake up at
night, Remembering my other life I scream. But every
dawning day the faith in me beyond my reach more
distant fades. My eyes are gallows and my heart&#39;s a
nervous wreck My cries are fondled by the hangman&#39;s
deadly kiss Oh believe me, I&#39;m running out of
time....&quot;

&quot;Next time, I choose your song,&quot; Casey murmured as
she kissed Tambi on the cheek. Tears shone in her
eyes. &quot;Nice, though.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tambi agreed as she exchanged a long look
with Katchoo, both of them remembering shared history
together.
The door opened after a fast knock and two familiar
figures strode inside, one grinning sheepishly. &quot;Hey
boss,&quot; Cherry Hammer waved as she entered.

&quot;Hello everyone,&quot; Carolyn smiled, the agent grinning
slightly as she strode to the table. &quot;May I?&quot; she
asked Margie as she grabbed the seat beside her.

&quot;Be my guest,&quot; Margie purred, a speculative look in
her eye.

&quot;I remember when she used to get that look around
you,&quot; Francine bent over to whisper in Katchoo&#39;s ear.

&quot;I still think you were over reacting to that,&quot;
Katchoo whispered back.

&quot;Wanna bet?&quot; Francine chuckled.

&quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot; Cherry asked, her grin
nearly frightening.

&quot;Brace yourselves for Elvis&#39; greatest hits.&quot; Tambi
sighed.

Cherry stuck her tongue out then grinned as the music
began, &quot;A little less conversation, a little more
action please, All this aggravation ain&#39;t
satisfactioning me, A little more bite and a little
less bark. A little less fight and a little more
spark. Close your mouth and open up your heart and
baby satisfy me Satisfy me baby.&quot;

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Casey cheered. She looked around,
&quot;Francine, take a turn.&quot;

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Francine quickly said.

Katchoo reached out to squeeze her shoulder gently.
When Francine turned to look at her she smiled,
&quot;Please?&quot;

Francine blushed, reluctantly stepping up to sing.
Scrolling through the list she smiled and chose a
selection, then began, &quot;You could say I lost my faith
in science and progress. You could say I lost my
belief in the holy church. You could say I lost my
sense of direction. You could say all of this and
worse but...&quot;

Francine smiled tenderly at Katchoo, &quot;If I ever lose
my faith in you, There&#39;d be nothing left for me to
do....&quot;

To be continued....
