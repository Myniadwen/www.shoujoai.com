Juri sat down behind her office desk and turned the power on for her 
laptop computer. She opened up her email account, blinking at all the 
messages stored there. She scrolled through them, then clicked on one 
and read it swiftly.

&quot;You mind if I stop in?&quot; The short message was simply signed, &quot;Lain.&quot;

Reply was hit and Juri typed, &quot;Sure, come on by. Just don&#39;t freak out 
the customers too badly.&quot; She clicked on send and smiled slightly.

&quot;Aww, that takes all of the fun out of it.&quot; Lain paused a moment 
before she added, &quot;I&#39;ll see you tonight, then.&quot;

Juri closed her up email again after checking out her remaining 
messages then she headed downstairs to check over the bar before 
opening tonight. She still didn&#39;t know what, exactly, the woman called 
Lain really was. A ghost in the machine? A god of the information 
super-highway? The princess of the Wired? Whatever she was, Lain was a 
pleasant and courteous patron of the bar, and that was good enough for 
her.

&quot;Hi, Jiri,&quot; Tendo Nabiki gave her a casual wave as she made her way up 
the hallway. Before the woman could get by her Juri grabbed her by the 
collar and hauled her back. &quot;Something wrong, Juri-san?&quot; she asked 
nervously.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Juri said dangerously. &quot;You&#39;re the one who used temporary 
&#39;Sping of Drowned Girl&#39; to get all those guys in here,&quot; she scowled.

&quot;Would it help any if I donated half of my profits to the rape relief 
center?&quot; a resigned Nabiki quickly offered.

Juri paused a moment, letting Nabiki sweat for a moment. &quot;All right,&quot; 
Juri sighed. She fixed Nabiki with a look, &quot;But I&#39;m having Sasami go 
over your books.&quot;

Nabiki scowled, knowing how sharp the seemingly young girl could be. 
&quot;You fight dirty, Arisugawa,&quot; she growled.

Juri grinned, &quot;I learned from the best.&quot;

Later that evening a young woman stood alone, smiling slightly, up on 
the kareoke stage. Short brown hair, long dangling earrings, a single 
braid on the left side of her face and dressed up in a red shirt and 
black mini- skirt, she looked beautiful. But there was something... 
odd about that beauty, an almost unearthly feel.

&quot;And you don&#39;t seem to understand
A shame you seemed an honest man
And all the fears you hold so dear
Will turn to whisper in your ear
And you know what they say might hurt you
And you know that it means so much
And you don&#39;t even feel a thing

I am falling, I am fading
I have lost it all&quot;

There was a gentle smile on her face, and she was meeting the gaze of 
another young woman sitting in the crowd. Lain almost seemed sad as 
she sang, her voice taking on a touch of regret as she finished off 
the song,

&quot;I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning
Help me to breathe
I am hurting, I have lost it all
I am losing
Help me to breathe.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Lain,&quot; the woman was standing there waiting patiently at the 
side of the stage for Lain to step down. Long brown hair flowed over 
her slim shoulders, matching deep brown eyes that gazed up at Lain so 
kindly.

&quot;Arisu,&quot; Lain smiled at her tentatively, &quot;what are you doing here?&quot;

Arisu smiled down at Lain and softly explained, &quot;I just couldn&#39;t 
forget about you.&quot;

Lain nodded slightly, accepting that. &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; she 
asked her softly.

&quot;Would you care to join me?&quot; Arisu waved towards the now empty table 
that she had been sitting at.

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Lain smiled back.

&quot;That was so sweet,&quot; a blushing Hyatt murmured. The dark haired girl 
went oddly green and then fell right over.

&quot;No lying down on the job!&quot; her partner Excel grabbed her, &quot;We&#39;re 
working for the greater glory of Across!&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa,&quot; Hyatt corrected her weakly.

&quot;Arisugawa!&quot; Excel agreed, &quot;Lets go!&quot;

Keiko blinked as the two of them raced by her, Excel nearly dragging 
Hyatt behind her. She pushed her short brown hair back and asked, &quot;Did 
someone put too much sugar in Excel&#39;s tea this morning?&quot;

&quot;Maybe someone gave her a drink with caffine in it again,&quot; Cybergirl 
May mused, &quot;those are always bad for her.&quot; The busty woman smiled at 
her lover fondly as she adjusted her maid&#39;s uniform, &quot;I&#39;m just glad 
it&#39;s a quiet night.&quot;

Keiko was a bit surprised to see a counterpart of Ryouko waving from 
one of the tables. &quot;I&#39;ll get that, love,&quot; she smiled at May.

May kissed her on the cheek, &quot;See you later.&quot;

Keiko made her way through the crowds, swiftly reaching the table. She 
gave a smile and nod to Ryouko, then nearly froze at the woman sitting 
beside her. While clearly a woman, she had an uncanny resemblance to 
Tenchi Masaki.

&quot;I&#39;ve been getting that reaction all day,&quot; the female Tenchi smiled 
wryly.

Ryouko put her hand on Tenchi&#39;s, &quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot; She kissed 
her on the cheek, &quot;You know they want you.&quot;

Tenchi went red, &quot;Ryouko!&quot;

&#39;That&#39;s Ryouko all right,&#39; Keiko thought as she took their orders. 
&quot;Have you two gone up to the bar yet?&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;No,&quot; Tenchi looked at her curiously.

&quot;You really should,&quot; Keiko chuckled. &#39;I can&#39;t wait to see Minagi and 
our Ryouko&#39;s reactions,&#39; she thought with a smirk.

The Staff: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Minagi, Ryouko and Sasami are from the series Tenchi Muyo. 
Keiko is also from Utena. Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. Excel 
and Hyatt are from Excel Saga. And finally, Tendo Nabiki is from Ranma 
1/2.

The Characters in this Episode: Arisu and Lain are from Serial 
Experiments Lain. Ryouko and the female Tenchi are from Tenchi Muyo 
(No Need for Boys).

Author&#39;s Note: I&#39;ve only seen the first few episodes of Lain, but plan 
to see more of it. A very cool show. The song Lain is singing is 
Duvet, the opening theme of Serial Experiments Lain. </pre>
