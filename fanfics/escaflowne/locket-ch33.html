<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 33 of 88)</h1>

<a href="../escaflowne/locket-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><pre>Meeting, Drinking, and Singing.

The three of them got together for a mini council of war shortly 
before the Locket officially opened up for the evening. Juri drank 
some coffee, Keiko was sipping a bit of ginger ale, and Utena was 
sampling a new drink that Ryouko had made.

Utena took a cautious sip of her drink, and by the look on her face 
she obviously wasn&#39;t enjoying the mixture but was too polite to just 
send it back. &quot;So Touga&#39;s drinking is becoming a problem?&quot; she asked 
them.

&quot;That&#39;s what Nanami told me,&quot; Keiko nodded. She looked mildly butch in 
her black pants and white shirt, her hair braided down her back.

&quot;But why does she want me to go see him?&quot; Juri asked her. She 
continued, &quot;No insult meant, but we barely tolerated each other on the 
student council. Why not Utena?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it quite like that,&quot; Utena nodded, &quot;but I was 
wondering that, too.&quot; She looked down at her drink and with a little 
sigh tried a bit more. &quot;It actually tastes better as your tongue goes 
numb,&quot; she muttered.

Juri looked at her oddly, then reached out and slid Utena&#39;s glass away 
from her. &quot;I think that&#39;s enough of that,&quot; she said firmly.

&quot;Touga looks up to you a lot,&quot; Keiko said to Utena, &quot;and I think it 
would make him very uncomfortable to be seen in his current state by 
you right now.&quot; She looked at Juri, &quot;He respects you, but can deal 
with you as an equal.&quot;

Juri sighed softly. &quot;All right,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll go see Touga. But no 
promises on my being able to accomplish anything.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Juri,&quot; Keiko smiled, getting up to go to work readying the 
tables.

&quot;What&#39;s this I hear about a pink haired girl with a sword fighting 
Youma?&quot; Juri leaned over the table to ask Utena once Keiko had left.

Utena blushed, &quot;What, is it against the rules? Besides, I just 
happened to be at the right place at the right time.&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; Juri smiled at her, &quot;it was nicely done.&quot;

Later that night, and the place was jumping. Most of the regulars were 
there, and one or two new arrivals gave a bit of spice. There had been 
a string of pretty good karaoke singers when a wickedly grinning Aoi 
Futaba took the stage.

&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Yoriko sighed, wondering what her lover was going to do 
now. The song soon hit the chorus, and she began to laugh aloud.

&quot;Why can&#39;t we all just get along?

Boys, boys in the girl&#39;s room, Girls, girls in the men&#39;s room, You 
free your mind in your androgyny

Boys, boys in the parlor, Girls, they&#39;re getting harder, I&#39;ll free you 
mind in your androgyny.&quot;

Aoi smiled, hamming it up on the stage. She took a graceful bow when 
she finished and stepped down to sit by her lady love. &quot;So how did I 
do?&quot; she asked Yoriko with a grin.

&quot;You just have to remind everybody that you were once a boy,&quot; Yoriko 
chuckled.

&quot;Occasionally, yes,&quot; Aoi smiled back.

&quot;Way to go, Futaba,&quot; Juri sauntered over, &quot;now I&#39;m probably going to 
have another petition to boot you out of here. Gee, thanks.&quot;

Aoi blew her a loud raspberry. She pulled out a chair, &quot;Grab a seat, 
Juri. How are things going with Setsuna?&quot;

Juri waved down Mahoro as she was bustling by, &quot;Gingerale, please.&quot;

&quot;Hai, sempai,&quot; and Mahoro was gone like a shot. A moment later, she 
carefully put the drink on the table.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Yoriko blinked. &#39;That was fast,&#39; she thought.

&quot;I took Setsuna to my apartment, showed her around, asked her to move 
in with me, and she turned me down,&quot; Juri shrugged.

&quot;What?!&quot; Aoi blurted, nearly spraying Juri and Yoriko with her drink.

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that bad,&quot; Juri smiled, explaining the circumstances.

&quot;I forgot about the daughter,&quot; Yoriko admitted.

Over at the bar, Ryouko and Minagi were preparing a tray of drinks for 
Mahoro to carry to the tables. Ryouko looked over at the dark haired 
server curiously, &quot;I thought that you only had a year to live, or 
something?&quot;

Mahoro beamed, &quot;Washu fixed that.&quot; Her eyes got all big, sparkly and 
shoujo-like, &quot;Washu-sama can do anything!&quot;

Minagi blinked, &quot;Did you do anything to your personality?&quot;

&quot;No, why?&quot; Mahoro asked.

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Ryouko muttered.

A tall young woman strode up to the bar, her cold expression raking 
the crowd and quickly clearing a path for them. Her sandy hair fell 
into her eyes, and she flicked it back smoothly. Sadly, her attempt at 
being too cool for words was rather spoiled by the happily beaming 
young woman who was holding her arm.

Sai Jounouchi nodded to Minagi, &quot;Could I get some sake, please?&quot;

Still holding on to her arm Kaede Saitou smiled sweetly, &quot;A glass of 
wine, please.&quot;

Minagi poured the first bowl of sake for Sai, even as Ryouko produced 
a bottle of high quality red wine. &quot;You two play Angelic Layer, 
right?&quot; Minagi asked.

Sai looked a bit surprised, &quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;Two of your fellow players are regulars here,&quot; Ryouko stepped in to 
explain, &quot;Hotoko and Misaki, in fact.&quot;

Kaede chuckled softly, &quot;They must make a cute couple.&quot;

&quot;That they do,&quot; Minagi smiled.

In a darkened corner of the Locket a figure studies the crowd, 
drinking something thick and red from a tumbler. The black leather 
clad figure sets down the drink before loudly proclaiming, &quot;Bored 
now.&quot;

A young woman in a low cut dress walks by her, and the brown haired 
figure follows before a soft hiss of metal on metal is heard.

Saya holds the blade to her throat as she orders, &quot;Don&#39;t even think 
about it.&quot; Under her breath she mutters, &quot;Newbies.&quot;

Vampire Willow carefully steps back into the shadows before picking up 
her drink again. &quot;No fun,&quot; she pouts cutely.
