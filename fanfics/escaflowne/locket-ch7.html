Hitomi smiled up at Makoto as she walked in. &#39;She&#39;s so cute,&#39; Hitomi 
thought, looking the taller girl over, her athletic form dressed in a 
tight, business style dress. &#39;She&#39;s even wearing a tie,&#39; Hitomi 
sighed, unconsciously adjusting her own school uniform.

Her smile instantly turned into a little frown when she realized 
Matoko was here with a date. Haruna Sakurada followed Matoko in, 
wearing a slinky, long dress that swept around her. &#39;Oh, well,&#39; Hitomi 
thought a bit mournfully, &#39;I guess all the good ones are taken.&#39;

Before Hitomi could think of anything else, strong arms slid around 
her body from behind her. She loudly squealed as they squeezed her, 
and she whirled around to see Milerna standing right behind her, a 
little smile on her face. She wore a loose while shirt and skintight 
leather pants, a jacket resting over her slim shoulders.

&quot;Did you miss me?&quot; Milerna asked her with a cocky little grin, looking 
almost pirate like in the dim light of the bar.

As they walked inside, Makoto smiled as a slow song came on over the 
sound system. &quot;You look lovely tonight,&quot; Makoto said softly into 
Haruna&#39;s ear. She bent closer, whispering, &quot;Would you like to dance 
with me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Haruna said, looking up at her with a smile. Makoto 
gently led Haruna over to the dance floor and then took her into her 
arms. She snuggled in to Makoto as they slowly swayed together to the 
music. One slow song seemed to flow into another as they lost 
themselves to the pleasures of the dance.

Over by the jukebox, and concealed from their line of sight, Natsuna 
and Minako fretted as they went over the music selection. &quot;We&#39;re 
running out of slow songs,&quot; Minako complained, frowning down at the 
list.

&quot;It looks like they&#39;re having a good time though,&quot; Natsuna said, 
looking out at Haruna and Makoto dancing together. Makoto gently held 
Haruna in her arms, in a posture that said &#39;I have no intention of 
letting you go, ever&#39;. &quot;Are there any not-so-fast songs?&quot; Natsuna 
asked.

Minako nodded, feeding more coins in and then pressing more buttons. 
&quot;I hope they appreciate this,&quot; Minako said wryly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Natsuna said archly to her, &quot;I promise I&#39;ll reward you 
myself, later.&quot; Minako blushed faintly.

A tall, pink haired woman came over to them, her long hair flowing 
down her back. She wore a man&#39;s suit, slightly altered to fit, and 
looked both classy and cool. &quot;Could you do me a favor and put 
&#39;Sometimes, Love can&#39; on, please?&quot; she asked, pressing some coins into 
the surprised Minako&#39;s hand. She soon was swaying out on the dance 
floor, holding a dark skinned girl with purple hair held close to her.

Elsewhere on the large dance floor, Misato relaxed in Priss&#39; arms as 
they swayed to the music. &quot;Hmm, I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Misato sighed.

A gentle kiss, &quot;With my job and yours we don&#39;t see each other as often 
as I&#39;d like.&quot; A thoughtful look, &quot;But if we did it more often, I 
figure one of us wouldn&#39;t survive.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not that demanding!&quot; Misato protested cutely. &#39;Still, I was the 
one who suggested a morning quickie last time,&#39; she admitted to 
herself. &quot;Some progress of the Rei and Asuka front,&quot; she reported to 
Priss with a smile.

Priss grinned, thinking of that odd little couple, &quot;What&#39;s happened?&quot;

&quot;Rei&#39;s moved into Asuka&#39;s room,&quot; Misato said with a grin.

Priss was about to ask about that when she was bumped into by someone. 
She turned around, only to see... herself.

Urd looked over at the older Priss and the strange lady in surprise, 
keeping a firm grip on her own Priss&#39; arm. &quot;Well, this is 
interesting,&quot; she said dryly.

&quot;What in the world?&quot; Misato said, holding on to her Priss firmly, too.

The longer, spiky haired Priss found herself meeting the eyes of a 
slightly older, less punk version of herself. &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to 
try and figure this out,&quot; one Priss finally sighed out softy to the 
other one.

The other Priss firmly nodded her agreement. &quot;I really need to get a 
beer,&quot; she said with a smile, and both of them laughed softly.

Misato and Urd exchanged a knowing look, and each of them took a hold 
of their Priss and then headed off in opposite directions. &quot;You&#39;re 
probably a bad influence on yourself, you know that?&quot; Urd remarked.

Makoto smiled a bit sadly as Haruna eased herself back a bit from her 
grip. She looked up, Makoto&#39;s hands resting on her shoulders, then 
pulled Makoto down into a kiss on the lips. She wrapped her arms 
around Makoto&#39;s neck and kept on kissing, until they had to separate 
for a breath. &#39;Wow,&#39; Makoto thought dazedly.

&quot;I&#39;ve wanted to do that for the last few weeks,&quot; Haruna admitted. She 
smiled shyly. &quot;It was as nice as I hoped.&quot;

Makoto leaned down and kissed Haruna this time, using all the kissing 
experience she had gathered over they years. &quot;How was that?&quot;

&quot;Even better,&quot; Haruna admitted breathlessly.

&quot;Do you want to come home with me again?&quot; Makoto asked with a smile.

&quot;As long as we&#39;re both in that comfortable bed of yours,&quot; Haruna 
answered.

&quot;I think I can guarantee that,&quot; Makoto said, sliding a arm around 
Haruna&#39;s shoulders.

Our Cast This Episode: Hitomi and Milerna are from Escaflowne the 
Movie, Makoto, Minako, Haruna and Natsuna are from Sailor Moon, 
Misato, Rei and Asuka are from Neon Genesis Evangelion, Urd is from Oh 
My Goddess, And finally the two Prisses are from Bubblegum Crisis, 
original and 2040.

Parts of this episode , in a somewhat different form, have appeared 
previously in: Sailor Moon: Love and Lightning.

Author&#39;s Note: In A Goddess Comes to Call, Priss Asagiri (2040) meets 
and falls for Urd. In Girls Night Out, Priss (Original series) meets 
and becomes the snuggle bunny of Misato.

An cute little imaginary SD version of Priss Asagiri pops up, angrily 
proclaiming to everyone who can hear her, &quot;I&#39;m not her snuggle bunny!&quot;

SD Misato tackles her, loudly proclaiming &quot;Yes you are!&quot; Both SD 
characters fall into a tangle of arms and legs, and from the sound 
effects it appears that they&#39;re having a good time.

The problem is, I had both versions show up in the Locket at different 
times. So. I decided, why not have them meet...
