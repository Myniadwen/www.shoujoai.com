staggering slightly as Michiru reached out to steady
her sandy haired lover.

&quot;So did you actually plan to have Ryouko dancing on
top of the bar dressed in only a Santa hat?&quot; Michiru
looked over at Juri curiously as the slightly tipsy
green haired lady unlocked the front door of the
Outers&#39;&#39; home.

&quot;We never plan these things,&quot; Arisugawa Juri answered
with a smile, &quot;they just kind of happen.&quot; She shook
her head, orange waves of hair flowing as she
murmured, &quot;I&#39;m just glad that we didn&#39;t have the kids
at the Locket this year.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Setsuna agreed, nodding her head. The black
haired woman looked lovely in her simple dress,
holding on to Juri&#39;s arm in a comfortable way.

&quot;Like to come in?&quot; Haruka smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;m sure
that Hotaru would like to say hi before she goes to
bed.&quot;

&quot;Sure, why not,&quot; Juri smiled. She looked over at
Setsuna and asked, &quot;When will Hotaru be back from the
kids&#39; party?&quot;

&quot;The party up at the temple should be over by now,&quot;
Setsuna noted, &quot;but I don&#39;t know if Hotaru will be
staying over with Chibi-Usa tonight.&quot;

&quot;We can stay up a bit,&quot; Juri squeezed Setsuna&#39;s hand
gently as they settled into one of the couches, noting
the decorated tree in the corner with presents beneath
it.

&quot;Have you and Setsuna opened your gifts yet?&quot; Michiru
asked, carrying in some drinks from the kitchen then
snuggling in beside Haruka.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Setsuna flashed a smile as she continued,
&quot;we&#39;ll wait until Christmas morning.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Juri raised an eyebrow, &quot;You two didn&#39;t give us
a naughty gift, again?&quot;

Haruka just smirked. Tilting her head to the side she
continued, &quot;I was a bit surprised you went with the
gift-card route this year.&quot;

&quot;They weren&#39;t gift cards,&quot; Juri smiled.

Setsuna chuckled softly, &quot;They were debit cards, tied
to separate accounts Juri set up for each of them.
Their Christmas bonus plus a... substantial sum for
each.&quot;

&quot;Generous,&quot; Michiru noted.

&quot;My stocks did well this year,&quot; Juri shrugged before
frowning slightly, &quot;and we&#39;re understaffed, so they&#39;ve
really earned it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re looking for someone, of course,&quot; Haruka took a
drink, smiling.

Juri nodded, &quot;And I consulted with Hitomi, too.&quot; She
made a face, &quot;Apparently whomever it is will show up
in the near future, but other than that....&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe that you see a fortune teller,&quot;
Michiru murmured with a smile.

&quot;And is that any different than us going to Rei?&quot;
Setsuna countered calmly.

&quot;She&#39;s got you there,&quot; Haruka chuckled. She looked at
Juri curiously, &quot;So what&#39;s been planned for New
Years?&quot;

&quot;A costume party,&quot; Juri chuckled, &quot;dress up as your
favorite figure in history.&quot;

There was a click as the front door opened then Hotaru
came inside, her short black hair framing her face.
&quot;Welcome home,&quot; Setsuna smiled, &quot;have fun?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Hotaru flashed a smile. She tiredly hugged
Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna goodnight, then clearly
surprised Juri by hugging her, too. Juri was a bit
startled but she recovered quickly, hugging the
younger girl back.

&quot;I almost wish I had a camera,&quot; Michiru chuckled once
Hotaru had headed to bed.

Juri had the slightest of smiles on her face as she
murmured, &quot;I knew Hotaru had gotten more used to me,
but....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Setsuna squeezed Juri&#39;s hand.

Haruka looked amused, then unexpectedly yawned.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she looked sheepish, partially covering her
mouth with a hand.

Juri looked over at a clock and shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s
well past two in the morning,&quot; she got up, helping
Setsuna up as she added, &quot;we&#39;d better get to bed if we
want to avoid being completely exhausted on Christmas
Day.&quot;

&quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; Michiru waved as Juri and Setsuna
left the house and moved over to the attached suite
where they lived. In the months they lived here they
had gradually personalized the small home, each one
bringing their own style and taste to the place.

Setsuna casually hung up the coats as Juri dropped
their bags of gifts by the Christmas tree in their own
livingroom. &quot;So,&quot; Setsuna asked curiously as they
moved into the bedroom together, &quot;how are Utena and
the others?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much as usual,&quot; Juri admitted as she
undressed, &quot;Utena and Anthy are looking for a place to
live together, Touga&#39;s being a bit more of a
respectable playboy, and from what I understand
Saionji has gone up to the Masaki shrine to train.&quot;

&quot;Miki and Nanami?&quot; Setsuna asked as they settled into
bed.

&quot;Eloped,&quot; Juri flashed a impish grin, &quot;they decided to
avoid the sort of trouble their families might cause
and got married secretly.&quot;

Setsuna looked over at her lover perceptively, &quot;A
little disappointed?&quot;

Juri shrugged a bit uncomfortably, &quot;Yeah, maybe. Miki
and I were very close back at Ohtori, I would have
liked to help....&quot;

Setsuna nodded slightly, &quot;One of the harder things
I&#39;ve had to learn as being a Senshi has been that
sometimes, people don&#39;t want help.&quot;

Juri nodded slightly, the two of them cuddling
together on the big bed. &quot;I&#39;d quite happily ravage
you,&quot; she murmured sleepily, &quot;but I&#39;m just too tired.&quot;

Setsuna laughed, &quot;Tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Juri purred.

A few nights later and Arisugawa&#39;s Locket was jumping
as the New Years party went into full swing. Ryouko
grinned as she worked the bar, the cowboy hat and
matching costume fitting her perfectly while her
sister Minagi wore a dress from the same era.

Mahoro looked at the blue haired twins curiously, &quot;Why
the similar costumes?&quot;

&quot;So we can switch outfits later on,&quot; Minagi flashed
the black haired woman a grin, her scarred cheeks
giving her smile a more impish cast.

&quot;You two worry me occasionally,&quot; Mahoro chuckled, her
Victorian maid&#39;s outfit hugging her slim body as she
raced to answer a order.

&quot;I wonder where Juri is?&quot; Ryouko murmured as she slid
a beer down the bar.

Not too far from the buildings a battle raged on, four
figures moving swiftly to face the band of inhuman
enemies. The pink haired woman&#39;s sword gleamed as she
dodged, Utena&#39;s robin&#39;s blue eyes narrowed intently as
she commanded, &quot;Yield or die.&quot;

Anthy threw herself into the air, the dusky skinned
woman&#39;s rose colored uniform edged in black, the red
rose held confidently in her hand. She threw it with
unearthly precision, driving another beast backward
right into the others. &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to
give up,&quot; she noted as she landed beside Utena, the
other woman&#39;s clothes black edged in rose.

&quot;And why,&quot; Juri raised her Juraian sword, the orange
energy blade matching her hair, &quot;do the Youma decide
to turn up at the worst times?&quot;

Sailor Pluto flashed a smile at here lover, the black
haired Senshi of time holding her staff at the ready.
&quot;The fates have a sense of humor?&quot; she suggested. She
dropped her voice, &quot;Thanks for agreeing to help out.&quot;

Juri smiled at her lover, &quot;For you, anything.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s finish this,&quot; Utena said as she raised the
sword of Dios, the blade glowing white in the growing
twilight.

&quot;Dead Scream,&quot; Sailor Pluto brought her staff around,
temporal energies swirling only to strike out into the
core of the monsters, the others following up swiftly.

Back at the locket Bones stood guard at the door, the
muscular black haired woman looking at the lady
standing there thoughtfully. She was dressed casually,
her green hair a bit messy and clothes just a touch
travel stained. A heavy bag was slung over her
shoulder and a musical instrument&#39;s case was nearby.

&quot;Something I can do for you?&quot; Bones asked.

&quot;This is a nightclub?&quot; the green haired woman looked
up at the neon sign, Arisugawa&#39;s Locket written boldly
with a cartoon of a locket containing the picture of a
pretty girl beneath it.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Bones admitted.

&quot;My name is Alpha,&quot; she smiled engagingly before
continuing, &quot;I was wondering who I would ask about
getting a job here?&quot;

To be continued....

The Staff: The bar&#146;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from
Revolutionary Girl Utena. Minagi and Ryouko are from
the series Tenchi Muyo. Mahoro is from Mahoromantic.
And finally, Bones if from

Our Cast This Episode: Setsuna, Haruka, Hotaru and
Michiru are all from Sailor Moon. Utena, Anthy and the
other Duelists are from Revolutionary Girl Utena.
Finally, Alpha is from the anime and manga Yokohama
Kaidashi Kikou.

Author&#39;s Note: I&#39;ve been reading Yokohama Kaidashi
Kikou online for awhile, as well as getting the three
episode OVA and have become quite fond of the series.
Alpha is an android running a small, rundown cafe and
the series focuses on her relationships with the
people in her community. Mildly shoujoai as well, in
her relationship with a fellow android.</pre>
