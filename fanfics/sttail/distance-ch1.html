<h1>Distance</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../sttail/index.html">Kaitou Saint Tail</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jchua.html">Johann Chua</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Meimi Haneoka stormed silently into her room.  Lightning seemed to be 
building up within her fiery red mane as her rose-colored beret fell 
off.

Eddies of dust would have followed in her wake if the floor hadn&#39;t 
been cleaned recently.  The door thundered shut.

Of all the nerve!  How could Dad even think that I--

A knock on the door interrupted her train of thought.  &quot;Meimi honey?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mom?&quot;

&quot;Could I talk with you for a minute?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot;  Meimi opened the door for her mother.  Eimi came in with a 
weary smile, evidence of having to calm her husband down.

&quot;Your father certainly gets carried away at times, doesn&#39;t he?&quot; Eimi 
said as she and Meimi walked over to the bed and sat next to each 
other.

Meimi groaned as she recalled the latest episode.  &quot;That&#39;s putting it 
mildly.&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s a little annoying, but he&#39;s only concerned because he 
loves you.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;  Meimi sighed.  &quot;But he was worried about me liking girls 
instead of boys!&quot; she said, seething, her hands balled up tightly on 
her lap.

&quot;Well, to tell you the truth,&quot; Eimi said, &quot;he wasn&#39;t exactly 
overreacting.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot;

Before Meimi could say another word, Eimi kissed her fully on the 
lips. Her hand held onto her daughter&#39;s hip as they came parallel to 
the sheets.

Oh God, this can&#39;t be happening, Meimi thought; her eyes widened then 
shut as she felt her mother&#39;s tongue on hers.  And yet...she found 
herself returning the lingual caress, inviting her mother to explore 
her mouth even further.

&quot;Feels good, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Eimi asked as she hovered over Meimi after 
breaking off the kiss.

&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;  Meimi blushed at having agreed so easily.  Maybe Dad was 
right.

Eimi giggled.  &quot;You&#39;re my daughter all right,&quot; she said, assured that 
they had a lot in common--more than Meimi did with her father, at any 
rate.  The same temperament; silky, long red hair; and: &quot;After all, 
you do spend an awful lot of time sneaking around at night, just like 
I did when I was younger.&quot;

Compared to the kiss, this revelation was hardly surprising.  Meimi 
surmised it was one reason why her father didn&#39;t want her taking after 
her mother; your daughter being chased by the police wasn&#39;t something 
that put your mind at ease.  The other reason was apparent in the 
rather intimate display of affection she and her mother had just 
shared.  Meimi wondered if any of the girls at school would like to 
try it with her if they knew that she was St. Tail, considering how 
much they admired the daring young thief.

Eimi noticed her daughter&#39;s thoughtful expression.  &quot;Would you like to 
try something that feels even better?&quot;  Meimi nodded in assent, 
offering herself to her mother.  Eimi smiled with glee as she prepared 
to take her daughter&#39;s innocence.  She pulled Meimi and herself 
upright.  Meimi&#39;s jacket slipped off with ease in Eimi&#39;s skillful 
hands.

Her hand slid under Meimi&#39;s skirt and glided ever so lightly between 
her thighs until it reached her panties; she stroked the moist pink 
fabric, eliciting an ecstatic quiver from within.  Her other hand 
slipped under Meimi&#39;s blouse, fondling a tender breast through her 
bra.  She nibbled on Meimi&#39;s ear, biting and licking the lobe with 
delight, then trailing down her neck and shoulder.

Meimi&#39;s breathing was frenzied as she writhed in pleasure, craving and 
savoring her mother&#39;s ministrations.

She removed Meimi&#39;s blouse and bra, freeing her breasts.  As Meimi lay 
in bed a wonderfully warm breath of air greeted each erect nipple 
before being bathed by Eimi&#39;s tongue.  As she suckled on Meimi, Eimi 
slipped her hand into Meimi&#39;s panties and began fingering her slit, 
sending Meimi&#39;s pulse racing.

She stopped and tasted Meimi&#39;s wetness on her fingers, leaving her 
wanting more.  She knelt on the floor between Meimi&#39;s legs, pulled off 
her panties, and spread her legs apart, leaving a clear path to 
Meimi&#39;s womanhood.  Eimi kissed and stroked Meimi&#39;s inner thighs 
before turning her attention to her daughter&#39;s cleft.  Meimi gasped as 
Eimi tongued her moist petals up and down, spreading them apart to go 
in deeper.  The scent of Meimi&#39;s womanhood intoxicated Eimi as she 
nuzzled her daughter&#39;s pubic curls.  She slid her fingers smoothly in 
and out of Meimi&#39;s slit and licked her swelling clitoris until it felt 
like it was going to burst.  With her free hand Eimi resumed fondling 
Meimi&#39;s breast.

Meimi started kneading her other breast in sync with her mother.  Her 
hips thrust towards Eimi&#39;s hand and face, drawing her mother&#39;s head in 
deeper between her firm thighs.  Eimi upped the tempo of her fingers 
and tongue, bringing Meimi closer to the brink of orgasm.  After what 
seemed like an eternity of bliss, Meimi reached the peak of pleasure, 
crying out in joy.

Blood rushed throughout her body in rhythm with her climax.

Eimi licked her lips, savoring Meimi&#39;s sweet liquor before kissing her 
again.  Meimi tasted herself on her mother&#39;s lips.

&quot;So, what do you think, honey?&quot;

&quot;I guess I do take after you, Mom.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s Notes: So, you&#39;ve made it this far, eh?  This fic is the 
result of me trying to make a story out of a few lines from the show.  
Eimi asking, &quot;You&#39;re taking after your mother, aren&#39;t you, Meimi?&quot; and 
Genichirou saying, &quot;You don&#39;t like boys?  You mean you prefer girls?  
Oh my, that is a problem!&quot; both preceded Genichirou&#39;s overly concerned 
father routine, so I decided to put two and two together to make five.

Editor&#39;s Notes: Ignore the _1984_ reference.  Better yet, ignore this 
fic or at least let it stain his reputation.  I had nothing to do with 
this.
