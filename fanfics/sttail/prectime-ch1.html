<h1>Precious Time</h1>

<pre>	Meimi, I&#39;m glad that you and Asuka Jr. are finally together. 
	Even when the two of you fought like little children, I knew
you would be right for each other.

	And that&#39;s why I never said anything about how I really felt.
	God knows how often I teased you about him.  Anyone could see
that there was something going on between the two of you--they just
didn&#39;t know _what_.  Of course, no one else knew you were St. Tail,
but Rina Takamiya came awfully close.

	I was so worried, the day she first came to school.  I was
afraid something dreadful would happen to you.

	And it almost did.

	Her suspicions were right on target: you were her only suspect
for St. Tail&#39;s real identity.

	That time I was dressed as you in the dressing room was the
longest moment in my life.  The disguise was rather impressive, but
still, I knew Rina might not have been convinced.  Thank heaven she
was.  I would&#39;ve lost you, otherwise.

	Is it wrong for me to love you the way I do? 
	No, I can&#39;t believe that.  How can loving anyone be wrong? 
	But how I express it might be. 

	Just to feel your lips on mine would be heaven.  But I know it
won&#39;t happen.  Because you love him.

	You love me the way you would a sister.  Since I am a
Sister-in- training, I really shouldn&#39;t expect anything more from you
or anyone.  I made up my mind to devote my life to God.  Yes, it&#39;s a
lot of work, and I miss being able to just have another snack when I
felt like it--but it isn&#39;t supposed to be easy.  It never was and
never will be.

	That&#39;s why I&#39;m glad that, while you were St. Tail, we shared
so much precious time alone with each other.
