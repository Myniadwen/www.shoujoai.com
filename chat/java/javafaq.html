<center><u><h2>Welcome to the Java-on-IRC FAQ</h2></u></center>
<p>
This FAQ is here to help you learn the basics of IRC and how to use the PJirc java applet that connects to DarkMyst's #shoujoai.
Most of the commands will work with the MaxEvo applet as well, though its features and capabilities may differ. And
every command will work with a full-featured IRC client such as <a href=http://www.mirc.com>mIRC</a> or X-Chat.
<b><h3>How do I join a channel?</h3></b>
<p>
Click in the long, thin rectangle at the bottom and type <b>/join #channelname</b>, 
replacing "channelname" with the channel you want to join (i.e., #shoujoai). This rectangle is where
all your text and commands will go.
<p>

<b><h3>Can I be on multiple channels at once?</h3></b>
<p>
On the DarkMyst applet at least, yes. Just type another join command, and you'll be in both rooms.
<p>

<b><h3>How do I know what channels I'm on?</h3></b>
<p>
There are two arrowed boxes at the bottom of the window that Say "Public" and "Private."
The "Public" arrow will have boxes next to it with the names of channels you are currently in; 
click on a box to switch back and forth between them.
<p>

<b><h3>How do I change my name?</h3></b>
<p>
Similarly to joining channels, type <b>/nick NewName</b>, replacing "NewName" with the name
you want to use. For example, to change your name to Sakura, type <b>/nick Sakura</b>.
<p>

<b><h3>Help! It says someone else owns this name!</h3></b>
<p>
Just choose another one. If you delay your name may be reassigned to something like
Guest1234, but you can still change it. Note: if you are disconnected, the name's owner may
have "ghosted" you; see the section below on server joining to rejoin.
<p>

<b><h3>How do I rejoin if I am disconnected?</h3></b>
<p>
First check to make sure your internet connection is working. If everything else internet-related
still is, you were likely disconnected at the server level. Just type <b>/server irc.darkmyst.org</b>
to rejoin the server. Then, reset your name and rejoin any channels you were in.
<p>

<b><h3>How do I learn more about someone?</h3></b>
<p>
If you would like to see what a person's hostmask, name, and joined channels are, type <b>/whois Person</b>.
This will show you some information about them (replace "Person" with the name they are using). If you would
also like to see how long they have been idle, type <b>/whois Person Person</b>. This is called a "global whois."
<p>

<b><h3>What do the "sets mode to +something" messages mean?</h3></b>
<p>
The channel operators use these "modes" to help manage the channel. They may apply to
a single person, or to the channel itself. Here are the most common:<br>
<ul>
<li>+o: A person who has +o set on them becomes an operator (op) in the channel. Operators have @ in front of their names.
<li>+v: A person who has +v set on them is "voiced," able to speak even if the channel is set to +m. They have a + in front of their names.
<li>+m: When a channel is set to +m, only ops and voiced people may send messages to the channel. 
<li>+b: A person with +b set on them is banned; they cannot enter the channel until they are set -b. Bans happen for repeated bad behavior; see below for more information.
<li>+s: A channel set +s is "secret" and does not appear in a person's user info when you use /whois on them.
</ul>
There are more, but they are of little concern to anyone but channel ops. 
<p>

<b><h3>I was just kicked off the channel. How do I get back in?</h3></b>
<p>
First, stop and ask yourself if you did something to deserve it. Have you been warned multiple times to stop
bothering someone, or drop a particular line of conversation? A kick is a reminder to behave;
you can rejoin the channel immediately by typing a join command, but stop doing whatever it was you were doing to get kicked.
Usually the person doing the kicking will provide a reason. 
<p>

<b><h3>I was kicked and now I can't get back in. What's going on?</h3></b>
<p>
Odds are you repeatedly ignored warnings to stop doing something, and an op set the +b flag
on you before or after kicking. This is called a kickban and, until it's lifted, you're not getting back in.
If you feel you have been unfairly banned, send email to Hazuki or Lady Meg if you cannot
get in contact with the one who banned you and they will review your ban. If an op mistargets, they will usually
immediately remove it and private-message you with an apology, and you can rejoin.
<p>

<b><h3>How do I get made an op?</h3></b>
<p>
Usually, you don't. Permanent ops are chosen by the channel founder, and any op may temporarily
place +o status on someone, but for the most part the op list remains static. Also, asking for ops
is a sure-fire way to make sure you never get them. 
<p>

<b><h3>Where can I learn more?</h3></b>
<p>
The internet has any of a number of much more in-depth IRC FAQs than this one. Google for them, or 
read the one on the <a href=http://www.mirc.com>mIRC site</a>.
